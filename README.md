## Strength in Numbers: Multiple Measures of Media Ideology


Attempts at quantifying media ideology have generally taken one of two routes. Scholars have either exploited the similarity between phrases used by the news media and the politicians, or they have exploited the differences in composition of the audiences. We forgo the conventional reliance on one set of cues. Instead, we pool both text and audience based measures to estimate the ideological location of a number of media sources in the UK. The UK presents an appropriate environment for carrying out our research given ideology of members of parliament cannot be simply gotten via voting records. We combine corpora of parliamentary speech and party manifestos with Twitter data to produce more reliable measures of news media ideology and insight into differences between the two metrics.
