"Labour",196410,"""THE NEW BRITAIN""  The world wants it and would welcome it. The British people want it, deserve it and urgently need it. And now, at last, the general election presents us with the exciting prospect of achieving it. The dying months of a frustrating 1964 can be transformed into the launching platform for the New Britain of the late 1960s and early 1970s.  A New Britain - mobilising the resources of technology under a national plan; harnessing our national wealth in brains, our genius for scientific invention and medical discovery; reversing the decline of the thirteen wasted years; affording a new opportunity to equal, and if possible surpass, the roaring progress of other western powers while Tory Britain has moved sideways, backwards but seldom forward.  The country needs fresh and virile leadership. Labour is ready. Poised to swing its plans into instant operation. Impatient to apply the ""new thinking"" that will end the chaos and sterility. Here is Labour's Manifesto for the 1964 election, restless with positive remedies for the problems the Tories have criminally neglected.  Here is the case for planning, and the details of how a Labour Cabinet will formulate the national economic plan with both sides of industry operating in partnership with the Government. And here, in this manifesto, is the answer to the Tory gibe that planning could involve a loss of individual liberty. Labour has resolved to humanise the whole administration of the state and to set up the new office of Parliamentary Commissioner with the right and duty to investigate and expose any misuse of government power as it affects the citizen.  Much of the manifesto deals with the vital social services that affect the personal lives and happiness of us all, the welfare of our families and the immediate future of our children. It announces, unequivocally, Labour's decisions on the nagging problems the Tories stupidly (in some cases callously) brushed aside:  The imperative need for a revolution in our education system which will ensure the education of all our citizens in the responsibilities of this scientific age;  The soaring prices in houses, flats and land;  Social security benefits which have fallen below the minimum levels of human need;  The burden of prescription charges in the Health Service.  Labour is concerned, too, with the problems of leisure in the age of automation and here again Labour firmly puts the freedom of the individual first.  ""It is not the job of the Government to tell people how leisure should be used"", the manifesto declares. But, in a society where facilities are not provided when they are not profitable and where the trend towards monopoly is growing, it is the job of the Government to ensure that leisure facilities are provided and that a reasonable range of choice is maintained.  The pages that follow set out the manifesto in full. Please study it.  WHY THE TORIES FAILED  This is an age of unparalleled advance in human knowledge and of unrivalled opportunity for good or ill. In ever-widening areas of the world the scientific revolution is now making it physically possible for the first time in human history to provide the whole people with the high living standards, the economic security, and the cultural values which in previous generations have been enjoyed by only a small wealthy minority.  Until 60 years ago when the Labour Party was founded, the ending of economic privilege, the abolition of poverty in the midst of plenty, and the creation of real equality of opportunity were inspiring but remote ideals. They have now become immediate targets of political action. Britain can achieve them provided that it resolutely wills three things: the mobilisation of its resources within a national plan; the maintenance of a wise balance between community and individual expenditure; and the education of all its citizens in the responsibilities of this scientific age, not merely a small section of them.  Since 1951, however, these opportunities of the scientific revolution have been disastrously wasted largely because of the Conservative determination since they took office to end the purposive planning of the post-war Labour Government and replace it with an economic free-for-all.  As a result, successive Conservative Chancellors have been unable to get the economy moving steadily forward. Every jerk of expansion has ground to a full stop as the Government jams on the brake in a desperate attempt to combat inflation and rising prices. This is why, while other countries have made giant strides forward, our progress in the past 12 years has been so fitful. So sharp has the contrast become that only 18 months ago a Tory Government, driven by economic failure, lost its nerve and prepared to accept humiliating terms for entry into the European Common Market in the vain hope that closer contact with a dynamic Europe would give a new boost to our wilting economy. Since the French veto our affairs have not improved.  Once again an election year boom is heading for a post-election ""stop"" -just as happened after the 1959 and 1955 general elections. Indeed, by hanging on to power to the last possible moment in the hope of gaining some temporary electoral advantage, the Government has made the task of its successor immeasurably' more difficult.  This chapter in our affairs must be brought to a close. Tinkering with policies that have clearly failed and half-hearted conversion to principles previously rejected will not suffice. Only a major change of attitude to the scientific revolution, including an acceptance of the need for purposive planning, will enable us to mobilise the new resources technology is creating and harness them to human needs. Only a major change in economic and fiscal policy can break the defeatist stop-go cycle and prevent another bout of stagnant production, rising unemployment and declining national strength.  Only with a new Government, with a sense of national purpose, can we start to create a dynamic, just and go-ahead Britain with the strength to stand on her own feet and to play a proper part in world affairs. We believe that such a New Britain is what the British people want and what the world wants. It is a goal that lies well within our power to achieve.  THE LESSONS OF 13 YEARS  But first, what lessons must we learn from the past? Thirteen years ago, when the Tories came to power, they claimed to have the remedies for our national problems. The medicines they offered were first, the restoration of a ""free"" market economy in Britain; second, cuts in community expenditure in the interests of low taxation.  The direct and crippling consequences of their free market policies are now well known. First, it has slowed up Britain's rate of industrial expansion. Not even the Tories' stop-go policies have been able to prevent some increase in production and in living standards but our record is now among the worst in the western world. If we had only kept up with the rest of Western Europe since 1951, our national income in 1964 would be one-third more than it is - and we should have available an extra £8,000m. of goods and services to meet Britain's problems and to raise living standards.  The Tories still peddle their boast - ""You've never had it so good."" The truth is that Britain could and should have had it a whole lot better, and in the process have shown a greater concern for the needs of others.  Second, it has necessitated a stop-go economic policy, resulting in intermittent bouts of high unemployment. A continuing excess of imports over exports, with consequential balance of payments and currency crises has forced the Government again and again to halt expansion and to squeeze and freeze the economy.  Third, it has led to growing stagnation, unemployment and under employment in large parts of the North, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, combined with a drift of work and people to the overcrowded London and Midland regions.  Fourth, it has led to chaos in our transport system. with unused rail and overused road services and an appalling congestion problem in all our cities.  Fifth, it has led to continuing inflation as companies have pushed up prices and bid with each other for scarce labour.  Sixth, it has led to soaring land and house prices which have made it almost impossible for local authorities to replan our towns or for many ordinary families to buy or rent a home.  Seventh, it has led to a pervasive atmosphere of irresponsibility; to a selfish, get-rich-quick mood, in which the public interest is always subordinated to private advantage.  No nation in the history of human endeavour was ever inspired to become great (or greater) with the venal philosophy of ""I'm all right, Jack"".  The consequences of their attitude to public expenditure have been no less crippling. While public money has been lavished on wasteful military projects, and while the Government has imposed on itself an ever-increasing burden of interest payments on the national debt, vital community services have been starved of resources.  In social security, we still have austerity National Insurance benefits that impose poverty standards on the retired, the sick and the unemployed and deny them their proper share in rising living standards.  In community services of all kinds we face such critical and neglected needs as the rebuilding of our towns, the creation of a modern road system, the provision of new hospitals and schools, and a desperate need for new housing.  In education we are faced today with a chronic shortage of teachers, with oversize classes, with far too many scandalously out-dated school buildings and with a system of higher and further education far too small for our minimum national needs.  No one can say, after 13 years, that Tory policies have not been put to the test. Not only is their failure now generally recognised, it is even apparent to the Tories themselves. The same party that began its rule with the shibboleths of a free market economy and cuts in public expenditure, now proclaim its conversion to economic planning and to an increased public spending programme of no less than £2,000 m. in the next five years.  A death-bed repentance may ease the Tory conscience, but it is a cynical and utterly unacceptable substitute for the lifelong sincerity and solidarity of the Labour Party on this crucial issue. Tory devices - or Labour Planning?  A PHILOSOPHY OF THE PAST  At the root of Tory failure lies an outdated philosophy - their nostalgic belief that it is possible in the second half of the 20th century to hark back to a 19th century free enterprise economy and a 19th century unplanned society. In an age when the economy is no longer self-regulating and when the role of government must inevitably increase, they have tried and failed to turn back the clock.  The same backward-looking approach has prevented them from responding to the major world changes of the last decade.  They have reacted churlishly to the rise of the new nations in Asia and Africa, including many new Commonwealth countries, that have emerged from the end of colonialism.  They have failed to respond to the immense new challenge of world poverty and racial antagonism.  They have failed to understand the revolution in national defence policies that nuclear weapons necessitate.  The effects of their policy at home and abroad are all too plain. They have denied us the rate of expansion we could and should have achieved; they have weakened our military power and they have reduced our political influence in the counsels of the world.  PLANNING THE NEW BRITAIN  We offer no easy solution to our national problems. Time and effort will be required before they can be mastered. But Labour has a philosophy and a practical programme which is relevant to our contemporary needs. The starting point is our belief that the community must equip itself to take charge of its own destiny and no l3nger be ruled by market forces beyond its control.  Labour does not accept that democracy is a five-yearly visit to the polling booth that changes little but the men at the top. We are working for an active democracy, in which men and women as responsible citizens consciously assist in shaping the surroundings in which they live, and take part in deciding how the community's wealth is to be shared among all its members.  Two giant tasks now await the nation: first, we must energise and modernise our industries - including their methods of promotion and training - to achieve the sustained economic expansion we need; second, we must ensure that a sufficient part of the new wealth created goes to meet urgent and now neglected human needs.  A. A MODERN ECONOMY  The aims are simple enough: we want full employment; a faster rate of industrial expansion: a sensible distribution of industry throughout the country; an end to the present chaos in traffic and transport; a brake on rising prices and a solution to our balance of payments problems.  As the past 13 years have shown, none of these aims will be achieved by leaving the economy to look after itself. They will only be secured by a deliberate and massive effort to modernise the economy; to change its structure and to develop with all possible speed the advanced technology and the new science-based industries with which our future lies. In short, they will only be achieved by socialist planning.  1. A NATIONAL PLAN  Labour will set up a Ministry of Economic Affairs with the duty of formulating, with both sides of industry, a national economic plan. This Ministry will frame the broad strategy for increasing investment, expanding exports and replacing inessential imports.  In the short term Labour will give priority to closing the trade gap-  (a) By using the tax system to encourage industries and firms to export more.  (b) By providing better terms of credit where the business justifies it.  (c) By improving facilities and help for small exporters, particularly on a group basis.  (d) By encouraging British industry to supply those manufactures which swell our import bill in time of expansion. With proper stimulus we can produce many of those things we are now forced to import from abroad.  But in the long run a satisfactory trade balance will depend upon carrying out Labour's overall plan to revitalise and modernise the whole economy. It will depend upon maintaining a steady and vigorous programme of long-term expansion.  TAX policies will contribute directly to the aims of the national plan. They will be used to encourage the right type of modern industry. Above all the general effect of our tax changes will be to stimulate enterprise, not to penalise it.  2. PLAN FOR INDUSTRY  Within the national plan each industry will know both what is expected of it and what help it can expect - in terms of exports, investment, production and employment. Farmers, too, will be given a new certainty with the establishment of commodity commissions to supervise and regulate the main imported foodstuffs and to balance imports with home production.  If production falls short of the plan in key sections of industry, as it has done recently in bricks and in construction generally, then it is up to the Government and the industry to take whatever measures are required.  PUBLIC OWNERSHIP  The public sector will make a vital contribution to the national plan. We will have a co-ordinated policy for the major fuel industries. Major expansion programmes will be needed in the existing nationalised industries, and they will be encouraged, with the removal of the present restrictions placed upon them, to diversify and move into new fields : for example, the railways' workshops will be free to seek export markets, and the National Coal Board to manufacture the machinery and equipment it needs. Private monopoly in steel will be replaced by public ownership and control. The water supply industry, most of which is already owned by the community, will be reorganised under full public ownership.  SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY  If we are to get a dynamic and expanding economy, it is essential that new and effective ways are found for injecting modern technology into our industries.  The Government provides over half the money spent on industrial research and development in Britain. Some of this research is already carried forward, in Government establishments like the National Research and Development Corporation set up by the last Labour Government, to the point of commercial development. This has already led to scores of new products and processes of which the Hovercraft and the Atlas Computer are only the most famous.  But to get more rapid application of new scientific discoveries in industry, new measures are urgently required. A Labour Government will  (i) Go beyond research and development and establish new industries, either by public enterprise or in partnership with private industry.  (ii) Directly stimulate new advance by using, in the field of civil production, the research and development contracts which have hitherto been largely confined to military projects.  (iii) Set up a Ministry for Technology to guide and stimulate a major national effort to bring advanced technology and new processes into industry.  MOBILITY AND TRAINING  Skill, talent and brain power are our most important national resources. Yet in Britain under the Conservatives much of the natural ability of the nation is being wasted. In far too many firms, technicians and technologists, designers and production engineers are held back by the social prejudices and anti-scientific bias of the ""old boy"" network.  In industry, though there are some first-rate training schemes, they are few and far between. Most young people, and particularly girls, are still denied either adequate training at work or release for further education in technical colleges. Older people who wish to change their jobs meet such obstacles as loss of pension rights and the absence of retraining schemes.  Is it any wonder that the British economy has been slow to evolve? Is it any wonder that there is widespread fear of automation or that so many of our skilled young people have sought opportunities abroad?  Labour believes that the national plan will require a faster rate of change in industry. To meet the human needs that will arise it is essential to combine with our education reforms a revolution in training. We must also extend joint consultation in industry, develop new techniques for forecasting future manpower needs and adopt radical new measures to reconcile security with mobility.  To this end we shall implement a charter of rights for all employees. This will include:  (a) The right to compensation for loss of job or disturbance.  (b) The right to half-pay maintenance during any period of sickness and unemployment.  (c) The right to first-rate industrial training with day and block release for the young worker.  (d) The right to retraining for adult workers.  (e) The right to full transferability of pension entitlements.  (f) The right to trade union representation and proper safeguards against arbitrary dismissal.  (g) The right to equal pay for equal work.  We shall also strengthen the factory inspectorate in order to reduce accidents.  3. PLAN FOR THE REGIONS  Within the framework of the national plan, plans must also be worked out for the different regions of the United Kingdom.  In the case of Wales and Scotland, the Labour Party has already made clear what needs to be done by issuing the policy statements, Signposts to the New Wales and Signposts for Scotland. As for Northern Ireland, the Northern Ireland Labour Party has issued its own statement Signposts to the New Ulster, to which the Labour Party national executive has given general approval.  For these three nations, as for the regions of England itself, control over the location of new factories and offices, inducements to firms to move to areas where industry is declining, the establishment of new public enterprises where these prove necessary - all these measures will be required to check the present drift to the south and to build up the declining economies in other parts of our country.  But it will not be enough to plan employment alone on a regional basis. Regional planning is also necessary if we are to solve the problems of slum clearance and overcrowding in our major cities; to carry out a vigorous programme for new town and overspill development, including the proposed new town for Central Wales; to clear up the ugly, scarred face of industrial Britain; to save the countryside from needless despoliation; and to get the co-ordination of higher education, further education and industrial training required to maintain economic expansion.  To bring together the different tasks of regional planning, and the different Ministries concerned, Labour will create regional planning boards, equipped with their own expert staffs, under the general guidance of the Ministry of Economic Affairs. These planning boards will work closely with representatives of the local authorities, both sides of industry and other interests in the region.  In Scotland and Northern Ireland more unified structures of administration already exist. These can be readily adapted for effective regional planning. In Wales, the creation of a Secretary of State, to which we are pledged, will facilitate the new unified administration we need.  4. PLAN FOR TRANSPORT  Nowhere is planning more urgently needed than in our transport system. The tragedy of lives lost and maimed; growing discomfort and delays in the journey to work; the summer weekend paralysis on our national highways; the chaos and loss of amenity in our towns and cities - these are only some of the unsolved problems of the new motor age.  Far from easing these problems, the Government's policy of breaking up road and rail freight co-ordination, of denationalising road haulage and finally of axing rail services under the Beeching Plan, have made things worse.  Labour will draw up a national plan for transport covering the national networks of road, rail and canal communications, properly co-ordinated with air, coastal shipping and port services. The new regional authorities will be asked to draw up transport plans for their own areas. While these are being prepared, major rail closures will be halted.  British Road Services, will be given all necessary powers to extend their fleet of road vehicles and to develop a first-rate national freight service. Reform of the road goods licensing system must now await the report of the Geddes Committee but, in the interests of road safety, we shall act vigorously to stop cut-throat haulage firms from flouting regulations covering vehicle maintenance, loads and driving hours.  Labour believes that public transport, road and rail, must play the dominant part in the journey to work. Every effort will be made to improve and modernise these services. Urgent attention will be given to the proposals in the Buchanan Report and to the development of new roads capable of diverting through traffic from town centres.  Labour will ensure that public transport is able to provide a reasonable service for those who live in rural areas. The studies already mentioned will decide whether these should be provided by public road or rail services.  5. PLAN FOR STABLE PRICES  The success of the national plan will turn not only on the new partnership between government and industry but on the success of new and more relevant policies to check the persistent rise in prices. Since the Tories came to power the value of the £ has shrunk to 13s. 4d.: it is still shrinking.  The pensioner and the housewife suffer most when prices rise. But the nation, too, is harmed because rising prices both reduce our exports and provoke inflationary increases in incomes.  The Tories first ducked this problem, then tinkered with resale price maintenance. Labour will attack it at its roots: in manufactured goods, monopoly and semi-monopoly price fixing; in agriculture, market chaos with an ever-increasing gap between what the farmer receives and what the housewife pays.  Labour will: (i) Give teeth to the Monopolies Commission, control take-over bids and mergers and take powers to review unjustified price increases.  (ii) Promote more orderly marketing of our major food supplies and encourage, in the interests of price stability, long-term contracts with overseas producers. In addition, Labour will make sure that the consumer gets better value for money by attacking selling rackets of all kinds, by ensuring that goods are independently tested and accurately labelled. It will also publicise good quality standards.  A NATIONAL INCOMES POLICY  This is not all. To curb inflation we must have a planned growth of incomes so that they are broadly related to the annual growth of production. To achieve this a Labour Government will enter into urgent consultations with the unions' and employers' organisations concerned.  Unlike Selwyn Lloyd's notorious and negative ""pay pause"", Labour's incomes policy will not be unfairly directed at lower paid workers and public employees; instead, it will apply in an expanding economy to all incomes: to profits, dividends and rents as well as to wages and salaries.  6. PLAN FOR TAX REFORM  As essential support to a fair national incomes policy will be a major overhaul of our tax system. Taxation must be fair and must be seen to be fair. The present situation where the largest gains are made, not through hard work but through the untaxed rewards of passive ownership of Stock Exchange speculation, must be ended.  In particular we shall tax capital gains; and block up the notorious avoidance and evasion devices that have made a mockery of so much of our tax system.  We shall also seek to lighten the burden of rates which today falls heavily on those with low incomes. While the reform of the rate system and investigation of alternative forms of local government finance may take some time to accomplish, we shall seek to give early relief to ratepayers by transferring a larger part of the burden of public expenditure from the local authorities to the Exchequer.  VALUE FOR TAXPAYERS' MONEY  Labour will take urgent measures to stop the waste of taxpayers' money. Millions spent on missile contracts, millions more on doles to private industry, have placed an additional burden on hard pressed taxpayers.  A Labour government will apply tests of the national interest before agreeing to subsidies for private manufacturing industries and will insist, as would any prudent private investor, on a voice in the control, and a share in the profits, where public funds are involved. Waste and profiteering by Government contractors, on defence and the health service, will be vigorously attacked.  B. MODERN SOCIAL SERVICES  Drastic reforms are now needed in our major social services. To make them fit for the 1960s and 1970s will be costly in money, manpower and resources. This will not be achieved all at once: but, as economic expansion increases our national wealth we shall see to it that the needs of the community are increasingly met. For the children, this will mean better education; for the family decent housing at prices that people can afford; for the sick, the care of a modernised health service; for the old people and widows, a guaranteed share in rising national prosperity: for all of us, leisure facilities better geared to the coming age of automation.  EDUCATION  Our country's ""investment in people"" is still tragically inadequate. The nation needs and Labour will carry through a revolution in our educational system.  (i) Labour will cut down our overcrowded classes in both primary and secondary schools: the aim is to reduce all classes to 30 at the earliest possible moment.  (ii) Labour will get rid of the segregation of children into separate schools caused by 11-plus selection: secondary education will be reorganised on comprehensive lines. Within the new system, grammar school education will be extended: in future no child will he denied the opportunity of benefiting from it through arbitrary selection at the age of 11. This reform will make it possible to provide a worthwhile extra year of education by raising the school-leaving age to 16.  (iii) To minimise the effects of the postponement of school leaving on the large family, Labour will replace inadequate maintenance grants with reorganised family allowances, graduated according to the age of the child, with a particularly steep rise for those remaining at school after the statutory leaving age.  (iv) As the first step to part-time education for the first two years after leaving school, Labour will extend compulsory day and block release.  (v) Labour will carry out a programme of massive expansion in higher, further and university education. To stop the ""brain drain"" Labour will grant to the universities and colleges of advanced technology the funds necessary for maintaining research standards in a period of rapid student expansion.  (vi) Labour will set up an educational trust to advise on the best way of integrating the public schools into the state system of education.  The modernisation of our school system will require time and money and manpower. In order to get the priorities right Labour will work out a phased and costed plan for the whole of education. To assure the funds, Labour will restore the percentage grant and transfer the larger part of the cost of teachers' salaries from the rates to the Exchequer.  Finally - and most important - since everything depends on teachers, Labour will give to teacher supply a special priority in its first years in office, negotiating a new salary structure including a new superannuation scheme favourable to part-time and elderly teachers, encouraging more entrants to teaching and winning back the thousands of women lost by marriage.  The whole future of our education depends on the success of a crash programme for teacher recruitment which appeals not merely to boys and girls at school but to adults with experience of practical life that will give an edge to their teaching.  LAND AND HOUSING  Under the Tories, the relentless pressure of decontrolled rents, Rachmanism, high interest rates and soaring land prices have pushed housing and flats beyond the reach of many ordinary families and have condemned yet another generation to squalid and over-crowded housing.  The first requirement is to end the competitive scramble for building land. Labour will therefore set up a Land Commission to buy, for the community, land on which building or rebuilding is to take place. Instead of paying the inflated market prices that have now reached exorbitant levels, the Crown Land Commission will buy the land at a price based on its existing use value plus an amount sufficient to cover any contingent losses by the owner, and to encourage the willing sale of land. The Crown Land Commission will not, of course, acquire land which continues to be used for agriculture, nor will it purchase the freehold of existing houses and other buildings so long as they remain in their existing use.  As a result of public acquisition, building land can be made available at cheaper prices; although the land will remain in public ownership, new owner-occupied houses built upon it will remain, under the new ""Crownhold"" system, the absolute property of their owners as long as the house stands.  At the same time, we shall go ahead with a sustained programme to provide more homes at prices that ordinary people can afford.  Labour will:  (i) Introduce a policy of lower interest rates for housing. It is impossible to say now what changes will be required in the general interest rate structure of the market. But because of its great importance to the family housing should be treated as a separate case deserving specially favourable borrowing rates.  This policy of specially favourable rates will apply both to intending owner-occupiers and to local authorities building houses to let. We should like this policy to apply to all owner-occupiers, but unless interest rates generally fall, it would be too expensive. We will, however, review' the problem and see whether, and in what form, help could be extended to hard pressed existing owner-occupiers.  (ii) Further help the owner-occupiers by providing 100 per cent. mortgages through local councils; by advancing funds to the building societies so that they can reduce the deposits required on old houses; by reducing conveyancing and land registration charges; by insisting on measures to stamp out jerry-building on new houses and by encouraging local authorities to develop advisory and other social services to assist the owner-occupier.  (iii) Repeal the notorious Rent Act, end further decontrol and restore security of tenure to those in already decontrolled rented flats and houses. We shall provide machinery for settling rents on a fair basis.  (iv) Carry out a new programme of modernisation of old houses. If landlords fail to bring their houses up to the new standards required, then such houses will be purchased by the local authority with an option to buy to those sitting tenants who wish to become owner-occupiers.  (v) Accelerate slum clearance and concentrate aid and resources more heavily on those authorities with the biggest housing problems.  (vi) Change leasehold law to enable householders with an original lease of more than 21 years to buy their own houses on fair terms.  Labour will also increase the building of new houses, both for rent and for sale. While we regard 400,000 houses as a reasonable target, we do not intend to have an election auction on housing figures. It is no good having paper plans for houses if - as the present Minister of Housing is now discovering - you haven't the bricks to build them.  The crucial factor governing the number of new houses that we can build - and indeed the schools, hospitals, factories, offices and roads that can be completed - is the output of the construction and building supply industries.  Here we shall need new machinery to put through a series of long-delayed reforms designed, above all, to increase the number of men - and particularly of trained men - in the industry and to secure the more rapid use of the new techniques of industrialised building.  SOCIAL SECURITY  Social security benefits - retirement and widows' pension, sickness and unemployment pay - have been allowed to fall below minimum levels of human need. Consequently one in four of National Insurance pensioners are today depending upon means-tested National Assistance benefits. Labour will reconstruct our social security system:  (i) Existing National Insurance benefits will be raised and thereafter linked to average earnings so that as earnings rise so too will benefits.  (ii) For those already retired and for widows, an incomes guarantee will be introduced. This will lay down a new national minimum benefit. Those whose incomes fall below the new minimum will receive as of right, and without recourse to National Assistance, an income supplement.  (iii) A new wage-related scheme covering retirement, sickness and unemployment will be grafted on to the existing flat rate National Insurance scheme. The objective is half-pay benefits for the worker on average pay. Those who are married will get more than half pay, as will the lower paid worker. Since benefits will be graded, so too will contributions, which will take the form of a percentage contribution on earnings.  Provision will be made for ""contracting out"" good private schemes along the lines already laid down in the Government's graded pension scheme. The relevant conditions will be strengthened in order to enforce provision for widows of contributors, and for deferred retirement. Steps will be taken to ensure transferabilitv of all private pension schemes.  (iv) Widows' benefits will be reshaped in a new and more generous way and for them the earnings rule abolished. The ""ten shilling widow"" will have her pension restored to its original purchasing value.  (v) A new national severance pay scheme will be introduced. In a period of rapid industrial change it is only elementary justice to compensate employees who, through no fault of their own, find that their job has disappeared. Directors and senior executives have long received a ""golden handshake"": the same principle of compensation for job loss will now be applied to the whole work force.  Labour recognises that the nation cannot have first-rate social security on the cheap. That is why we insist that the new wage-related benefits must be self-supporting and must be financed, in the main by graded contributions from employers and employees. For the same reason we stress again that, with the exception of the early introduction of the income guarantee, the key factor in determining the speed at which new and better levels of benefit can be introduced, will be the rate at which the British economy can advance.  HEALTH  The National Health Service was among the foremost achievements of the 1945-50 Labour Government. Since then it has been starved of resources and has failed to adapt sufficiently to modern needs. Serious shortages of hospital staff mean long delays in obtaining treatment, with waiting lists of nearly 500,000. Shortages of general practitioners mean long waits in overcrowded surgeries. Local services for the handicapped and the elderly are severely handicapped by lack of staff. Every part of the hospital service is impaired by outdated premises. As a result of this neglect the patient has suffered - in spite of the efforts of medical staffs. Labour will put the patient first.  (i) The most serious attack on the Health Service made by Conservative Ministers bas been the increasing burden of prescription charges imposed by them on those least able to pay. These charges will be abolished. Labour emphatically rejects recent proposals to introduce new charges for general practitioner services; our aim is to restore as rapidly as possible a completely free Health Service.  (ii) Labour will press ahead with a revised hospital plan. Nearly 20 years after the war the nation ought to have built far more than five general hospitals. The Tories' so-called ""plan"" is largely based on guesswork. It seriously underestimates the demand for beds in certain areas and for certain categories of need such as mental illness and old people's beds. And already this inadequate plan is being bogged down for lack of funds.  Labour will review the whole plan on the basis of a full assessment of local needs and provide the necessary finance to carry the plan through. In particular the plan must ensure that every women who wishes to, or needs to, have her baby in hospital shall be able to do so. We shall take steps to combat queue jumping for hospital beds.  (iii) Labour will greatly increase the number of qualified medical staff. We shall train more doctors and dentists both by increasing the number of students admitted to existing medical schools and by establishing new medical schools. We shall tackle the serious shortages of nurses, radiographers, dieticians and other ancillary staffs by recasting, in consultation with the unions concerned, the salary structure and the negotiating machinery.  (iv) We shall devote more resources to medical research.  (v) The community care services run by the local authorities the most neglected of all the health services in recent years will be given a new impetus.  Labour will: (a) Expand the home help and other domiciliary services which are so vital to the well-being of the old and sick; (b) Lay down proper standards for these services and recast the so-called ten-year health and welfare plan on this basis; (c) Provide high percentage grants where emergency action is required to bring a particular service up to standard, e.g. hostels for the mentally ill.  LEISURE SERVICES  Automation, new sources of energy and the growing use of the electronic calculating machine are beginning to transform almost all branches of our economic and social life. As these trends develop, the importance of leisure will steadily increase. It is not the job of the Government to tell people how leisure should be used. But, in a society where so many facilities are not provided because they are not profitable and where the trend towards monopoly, particularly in entertainment, is steadily growing, the Government has a duty to ensure that leisure facilities are provided and that a reasonable range of choice is maintained.  A Labour Government would therefore:  (i) End the present parsimony in the supply of public funds for out-door recreation:  develop the national parks: preserve access to the coast and protect it from pollution and unplanned development: set up a sports council to supply in consultation with local authorities and voluntary bodies the physical equipment, coaching facilities and playing fields that are so badly needed.  (ii) The Youth Service will be developed with grants for youth centres, swimming pools, coffee bars and other facilities without which the present service cannot function.  (iii) Give much more generous support to the Arts Council, the theatre, orchestras, concert halls, museums and art galleries.  (iv) Encourage and support independent film makers both for the cinema and television.  A NEW ROLE FOR BRITAIN  It is not only in the domestic field that the Conservatives have failed the nation. During these 13 years of Conservative power British statesmanship has been tested by three great challenges - the end of the colonial era, thawing of the cold war and the new military role for Britain which these developments require. In each case the Conservatives have shown their inability to keep pace with the dramatic changes in the world scene. They have lost any sense of vision of Britain's role in the second half of the 20th century.  Through their bankrupt and vacillating leadership the Tory Government have bequeathed to Labour a Britain dragging its feet, side-stepping the challenging issues of our time, forced to linger temporarily in the wings of history.  A. THE END OF COLONIALISM  When World War II unleashed the demand throughout Asia and Africa for the end of colonialism, Britain's first response was an act of creative statesmanship. The Labour Government, headed by Clem Attlee, granted full and complete independence to India, Pakistan, and Ceylon, and thereby began the process of transforming a white colonial empire into a multi-racial commonwealth. No nobler transformation is recorded in the story of the human race.  So long as they were in Opposition, the Conservatives denounced this policy as socialist scuttle. Faced with responsibility, however, in 1951 they were compelled very largely to accept it. But the leadership they should have given was vitiated by the Suez fiasco and the equivocal attitude to African demands for independence, and the promises which they made-and have been forced to break - to the settlers.  How little they were able to transfer their faith and enthusiasm from the old Empire to the new Commonwealth was shown when Harold Macmillan and Alec Douglas-Home both declared there was no future for Britain outside the Common Market and expressed themselves ready to accept terms of entry to the Common Market that would have excluded our Commonwealth partners, broken our special trade links with them, and forced us to treat them as third-class nations.  Though we shall seek to achieve closer links with our European neighbours, the Labour Party is convinced that the first responsibility of a British Government is still to the Commonwealth.  COMMONWEALTH IMMIGRATION  As the centre of a great Commonwealth of 700 million people, linked to us by ties of history and common interest, Britain faces the three great problems of poverty, rapidly rising population, and racial conflict.  By herself Britain cannot, of course, solve these problems; but more than any other advanced country of the west, we have the greatest opportunity and the greatest incentive to tackle them. We believe that the Commonwealth has a major part to play in grappling with the terrible inequalities that separate the developed and under developed nations and the white and coloured races.  That is why a Labour Government will legislate against racial discrimination and incitement in public places and give special help to local authorities in areas where immigrants have settled. Labour accepts that the number of immigrants entering the United Kingdom must be limited. Until a satisfactory agreement covering this can be negotiated with the Commonwealth a Labour Government will retain immigration control.  COMMONWEALTH TRADE  Under the Tories the Commonwealth share of our trade has been allowed to fall from 44 per cent. to 30 per cent. and the defeatist view that it will decline still further has gained ground.  Worse still, the Commonwealth itself came near to disintegration at the time of the Common Market negotiations. The recent Commonwealth conference showed its sturdy resilience, but what is lacking is any coherent policy at the centre. We shall:  (i) Promote more effective and frequent consultations between Commonwealth leaders, for example by the establishment of a Commonwealth Consultative Assembly.  (ii) Make a new drive for exports through a Commonwealth exports council.  (iii) Build a firmer base for expanding trade by entering into long-term contracts and commodity agreements providing guaranteed markets for Commonwealth primary produce at stable prices.  (iv) Ensure that development and capital investment programmes are geared to Commonwealth needs.  (v) Promote wider educational, cultural, scientific and technical contracts, a more imaginative system of links between British communities and towns and villages in the Commonwealth, and more opportunities for overseas voluntary service.  (vi) Encourage joint Commonwealth activity on developments required throughout the Commonwealth, such as a communications satellite and passenger aircraft designed for Commonwealth routes.  (vii) Work towards the creation of a pensionable career service for experts working in the Commonwealth.  THE NEW WAR - ON WANT  But the problem presented by the colonial uprising is not limited to the Commonwealth. Poverty is an ever-present fear for more than half the world's population. It presents the western industrialised nations with a tremendous challenge which we ignore at our peril: for there is a growing danger that the increasing tensions caused by gross inequalities of circumstances between the rich and poor nations will be sharply accentuated by differences of race and colour.  We believe that the socialist axiom ""From each according to his ability, to each according to his need"" is not for home consumption only. Labour will:  (i) Discuss with other countries proposals for expanding the trade of developing nations.  (ii) Increase the share of our national income devoted to essential aid programmes, not only by loans and grants but by mobilising unused industrial capacity to meet overseas needs.  (iii) Revive the concept of a world food board for the disposal of agricultural surpluses.  To give a dynamic lead in this vital field, Labour will create a Ministry of Overseas Development to be responsible not only for our part in Commonwealth development but also for our work in and through the specialist agencies of the United Nations. This new Ministry will help and encourage voluntary action through those organisations that have played such an inspired part in the Freedom from Hunger campaign. We must match their enterprise with Government action to give new hope in the current United Nations Development Decade.  B. NEW PROSPECTS FOR PEACE  The second great opportunity for British statesmanship arose as a result of the changes in the communist world that followed Stalin's death - changes which are gradually transforming the relations between the Soviet Union, Eastern Europe and China and rapidly changing the whole nature of East-West relationships. In 1945, it was the hope of the whole world that east-west co-operation would prove close enough to permit the United Nations to be transformed step by step into a world government.  When these hopes were blighted by Stalin's brutal intransigence, it was Labour's Foreign Secretary, Ernest Bevin, who took the lead in facing the harsh realities of the cold war, and in creating the Nato alliance as the basis of Europe's military security. But even during the grimmest periods of the Berlin airlift and the Korean War, Labour always regarded the cold war strategies as a second best, forced on us by Russia's obstinacy and remained faithful to its long-term belief in the establishment of east-west co-operation as the basis for a strengthened United Nations developing towards world government.  The attitude of the Conservatives after 1951 was very different. Viewing the world only in terms of old-fashioned power politics, resentful of the loss of empire, and the increasing influence of the new nations, they have been mainly concerned to build up a so-called independent British nuclear power in the vain belief that this would restore our influence in world affairs. Instead of throwing Britain's full weight into efforts to relax tensions and to halt the spread of nuclear weapons the Tories were content to play a minor and subordinate role leaving the initiative to others.  Moreover their isolationist nuclear policy has been a direct incitement to other nations to attain nuclear status. All the arguments the Tories have used for Britain have been repeated in France and find dangerous echoes in Germany. The spread of nuclear weapons cannot lead to disarmament or to the thawing of the cold war, only to a proliferation of nuclear arms and the heightening of tensions between East and West.  RELAXING TENSIONS  A Labour Government will do everything possible to halt this dangerous trend, and to resolve the differences at present dividing east and west.  First and foremost will come our initiative in the field of disarmament. We are convinced that the time is opportune for a new break-through in the disarmament negotiations, releasing scarce resources and manpower desperately needed to raise living standards throughout the world.  We shall appoint a Minister in the Foreign Office with special responsibility for disarmament to take a new initiative in the Disarmament Committee in association with our friends and allies. We have put forward constructive proposals:  (i) To stop the spread of nuclear weapons.  (ii) To establish nuclear free zones in Africa, Latin America and Central Europe.  (iii) To achieve controlled reductions in manpower and arms.  (iv) To stop the private sale of arms.  (v) To establish an international disarmament agency to supervise a disarmament treaty.  In a further effort to relax tension, a Labour Government will work actively to bring Communist China into its proper place in the United Nations: as well as making an all-out effort to develop east-west trade as the soundest economic basis for peaceful co-existence.  Peaceful co-existence, however, can only be achieved if a sincere readiness to negotiate is combined with a firm determination to resist both threats and pressures. In particular in dealing with the still intractable problems dividing Germany, we shall continue to insist on guarantees for the freedom of west Berlin.  A NEW LEAD AT THE UNITED NATIONS  But our most important effort will be concerned to revive the morale and increase the powers of the United Nations. Every year that has passed since the Conservatives came to power has seen Britain's influence in the United Nations decline. At home the Prime Minister and others have voiced their nagging criticisms while in the General Assembly, time and time again Britain is to be found among the ranks of the abstentionists on vital issues of freedom and racial equality.  This has reflected itself in the Government's equivocal attitude to racial problems in South Africa. Labour will stand by its pledge to end the supply of arms to South Africa. Britain, of all nations, cannot stand by as an inactive observer of this tragic situation.  Labour will reassert British influence in the United Nations. We will seek to strengthen the U.N. by developing its machinery for international conciliation, by making an effective contribution to the creation of an international police force, and by reforming the Security Council and the Economic and Social Council so that they are more representative of the new nations. We believe that the United Nations provides the natural venue for more frequent summit meetings.  For us world government is the final objective - and the United Nations the chosen instrument by which the world can move away from the anarchy of power politics towards the creation of a genuine world community and the rule of law.  C. DEFENCE POLICY  The Labour Party will ensure that Britain is adequately defended. This is manifestly not the position today.  In 13 years, the Conservatives have spent £20,000 m. and our defences are weaker than at almost any time in our history. Flagrant waste on missile and other projects has diverted funds and resources from urgently needed defence projects. This is one reason for their failure to obtain on a voluntary, regular basis the required numbers in the Army, to modernise their obsolescent equipment and to give them the long-range mobility needed for our commitments, particularly to the Commonwealth.  Mr. Macmillan's decision in 1957 to stake his all on Blue Streak, followed by further costly expenditure on Skybolt and now Polaris, has meant that the Navy too has been run down to a dangerously low level, and is now pathetically inadequate in numbers of ships in commission, in manning and in the most modern types such as nuclear-powered tracker submarines.  Many thousands of millions have been spent on the aircraft industry, but because of lurches in strategic policy, wrong priorities, and grave errors in the choice of aircraft, we are now in a position where obsolete types have not been replaced, and for such urgently needed machines as helicopters (which could make a great contribution to the security and effectiveness of our troops in Malaysia) we are dependent on the United States.  TORY NUCLEAR PRETENCE  The Nassau agreement to buy Polaris know-how and Polaris missiles from the U.S.A. will add nothing to the deterrent strength of the western alliance, and it will mean utter dependence on the U.S. for their supply. Nor is it true that all this costly defence expenditure will produce an ""independent British deterrent"". It will not be independent and it will not be British and it will not deter. Its possession will impress neither friend nor potential foe.  Moreover, Britain's insistence on this nuclear pretence carries with it grave dangers of encouraging the spread of nuclear weapons to countries not possessing them, including Germany.  The Government bases its policy on the assumption that Britain must be prepared to go it alone without her allies in an all-out thermo-nuclear war with the Soviet Union, involving the obliteration of our people. By constantly reiterating this appalling assumption the Government is undermining the alliance on which our security now depends.  LABOUR'S NEW APPROACH  A Labour Government's first concern will be to put our defences on a sound basis and to ensure that the nation gets value for money on its overseas expenditure. In this field, any government has a clear responsibility to ensure the security of its own people and the fulfilment of its obligations to other nations. As a first step, we shall submit the whole area of weapons supply to a searching re-examination in order to ensure that the limited sums available are spent on those weapons best designed to carry out our policies and fulfil our obligations.  We are not prepared any longer to waste the country's resources on endless duplication of strategic nuclear weapons. We shall propose the re-negotiation of the Nassau agreement. Our stress will be on the strengthening of our conventional regular forces so that we can contribute our share to Nato defence and also fulfil our peacekeeping commitments to the Commonwealth and the United Nations.  We are against the development of national nuclear deterrents and oppose the current American proposal for a new mixed-manned nuclear surface fleet (MLF). We believe in the inter-dependence of the western alliance and will put forward constructive proposals for integrating all Nato's nuclear weapons under effective political control so that all the partners in the alliance have a proper share in their deployment and control.  We do not delude ourselves that the tasks ahead will be easy to accomplish. Even now we do not know the full extent of the damage we shall have to repair after 13 wasted years of Conservative government. The essential conditions for success are, however, clear.  First, we shall need to make government itself more efficient. As the tasks of government grow more numerous and more complex, the machinery of government must be modernised. New techniques, new kinds of skill and experience are needed if government is to govern effectively. Certainly we shall not permit effective action to be frustrated by the hereditary and non-elective Conservative majority in the House of Lords.  At the same time new ways must be found to ensure that the growth of government activity does not infringe the liberties of the subject. This is why we attach so much importance to humanising the whole administration of the state and that is why we shall set up the new office of Parliamentary Commissioner with the right to investigate the grievances of the citizen and report to a select committee of the House.  Second, we shall seek to establish a true partnership between the people and their parliament. The government itself cannot create a new Britain. National regeneration must mean the release of energy in the whole people in the regions no less than in the capital, so that the drive towards renewal comes from the vitality and self-confidence of the community itself.  Third, we must foster, throughout the nation, a new and more critical spirit. In place of the cosy complacency of the past 13 years, we shall seek to evoke an active and searching frame of mind in which all of us, individuals, enterprises and trade unions are ready to re-examine our methods of work, to innovate and to modernise. Here too, the Government can give a lead by subjecting to continuing and probing review the practices of its own Departments of State, the administration of justice and the social services, the Statute Book with its encrusted laws - and the work of Parliament itself.  Fourth, we must put an end to the dreary commercialism and personal selfishness which have dominated the years of Conservative government. The morality of money and property is a dead and deadening morality. In its place we must again reassert the value of service above private profit and private gain.  The Labour Party is offering Britain a new way of life that will stir our hearts, re-kindle an authentic patriotic faith in our future, and enable our country to re-establish itself as a stable force in the world today for progress, peace, and justice.  It is within the personal power of every man and woman with a vote to guarantee that the British again become the go-ahead people with a sense of national purpose, thriving in an expanding community where social justice is seen to prevail."
NA,196410,"""THINK FOR YOURSELF""  The Liberal Party offers the electorate a radical, non-Socialist alternative. In the long run, our objective is to form a government. In the short run, we seek sufficient support to send back a force of Liberal M.P.s which will hold a decisive position in the next Parliament.  Many thinking people in Britain dissociate themselves from politics today. A strong Liberal Party is essential to bring them into public life.  In the past five years we have brought new blood into local government by increasing the number of Liberal councillors from 500 to over 1,800. We have pioneered great issues of policy like the Common Market, regionalism and the need for national policies on redundancy and monopolies.  Liberal by-election successes forced the Prime Minister to sack seven Ministers and make the first hesitant Tory gestures towards modernization. We ask for your vote at this general election to bring about a more substantial and dramatic change in British politics.  A decisive Liberal influence is needed, in particular, to carry out three major aims. Modern technology provides the means of achieving a new age of abundance which could provide everyone with a richer life and great new opportunities. Since the war this country has lagged behind and failed to seize these opportunities. The \vested interests in the Conservative and Labour parties have blocked the way. The Liberal Party seeks a decisive position in the next Parliament to make sure that change and growth are stimulated.  Our second aim is to ensure that individual people benefit from the new industrial revolution. The age of automation could be an age when the individual is trampled on and power is dangerously concentrated in the hands of big business and the state. Change must be humanised so that the new wealth within our reach is used to give the individual a richer life and protect the weak. Class consciousness in the factory, on the housing estate, or in politics, must give way to a new spirit of partnership.  The third Liberal objective is to apply the idea of partnership in international affairs. In the nuclear age mankind cannot afford narrow nationalism. The economic benefits of modern science can only be achieved if there is a lavish flow of ideas, people and goods, amongst the nations. The giant risks of the nuclear age and the explosive problem of world poverty cannot be mastered until the nations act together. A strong force of Liberal M.P.s will ensure that Britain plays a new and greater part as a pioneer of the new international order that mankind so badly needs.  CREATING THE WEALTH  Britain has lagged behind since the war because the ""Establishment"" in politics, in Whitehall, in industry, and the trade unions, has too often been unresponsive to the possibilities of the new age. To put this right, the way Britain is run must be drastically reformed; the new men and women who understand modern technology must be given wider opportunities to use their talents; economic growth must become a major aim through more skillful management of the nation.  A PLAN FOR EXPANSION  To give economic expansion top priority, central government must be reorganised, and a Ministry of Expansion set up as the hub of economic government.  Parliament, the Ministry of Expansion and industry, would then draw up and implement a national plan for economic growth. It would be drafted by the Minister of Expansion in consultation with industry and the unions and then submitted to Parliament for debate and approval. Parliament would weigh up the implications and decide on a 4, 5 or 6 per cent. rate of growth.  Expansion at home depends on selling more abroad. Britain should constantly take the initiative in the drive to bring down world tariffs. Cuts in our own high, outdated tariffs ',ill help to expand world trade. They will also bring down our costs at home and thus make our exports more competitive abroad.  The Government must play a far more positive role in the export drive. Commercial staff in British embassies abroad, for instance, must help individual firms and work with them to get orders and expand their markets.  The sterling problem once more threatens our economic growth. Liberals will take the initiative to solve this deep-seated problem by the radical step of pooling international exchange reserves.  The international reserve pool could then develop a world strategy for expansion and prosperity, and seek in particular to build up the wealth and buying power of the impoverished southern continents where we must sell our goods.  MOBILISING OUR SKILLS  Britain's most valuable asset is skill. But restrictive practices, poor management, and lack of enterprise at the top mean that this is too often wasted. Three men are used on average in our industry to produce the output of one American worker. This need not be so.  The Liberal plan will set a target for the growth of national output so that every working man and woman can make full and satisfying use of his or her time at work. Unions and management will be encouraged to bargain For higher basic rates, a shorter working week and longer holidays with pay, in return for the abandonment of out-of-date restrictive practices.  An incomes policy which penalises teachers and nurses, whilst speculators and company directors escape the net, is wrong. The Liberal incomes policy will aim at relating all incomes, including profits, to productivity. make allowances for groups that have been left behind, and see that social benefits like pensions, take their proper share of growing wealth.  Trade unions must be encouraged to adopt industrial unions and plant bargaining. Plant bargaining brings the shop stewards into the negotiations and cuts out the need to manipulate overtime, bonuses, and piece work rating, in order to get round the shortcomings of national rates. National agreements should fix adequate minimum rates and consolidate the position of groups who are getting left behind.  PARTNERS IN INDUSTRY  Go-ahead companies have already realised that the alternative to negative control by the unofficial strike is real participation by the employee in the running of his firm.  The Companies Act must be amended to give all established employees in public limited companies a status comparable to shareholders. Employees must be given a share in the decisions and profits of the companies in which they work. Employees should be represented on the board of directors, or on a joint supervisory council. This is one way to ensure that ability gets to the top.  Public companies must be required to publish more information about their accounts. they should be published every six months; firms should be compelled to publish full accounts of subsidiary and associate companies, including contributions to political parties.  All pension rights must be made transferable. At present too many employers try to prevent key men changing their jobs. Experienced employees must have a right to periods of long leave which they can use to widen their background or train for an alternative job.  In an age of automation everyone must have the opportunity to learn fresh skills throughout his or her working life. There must be a massive expansion of education for management and government training centres, shorter and more flexible apprenticeships, and freedom of entry into skilled trades for qualified workers of any age.  To provide security against redundancy a national redundancy fund must be set up, financed by contributions from employers and the state. This would supplement unemployment benefit up to at least two-thirds of a worker's average earnings. Individual firms would be encouraged by tax rebates to provide even better benefits.  REDUCE INCOME TAX  We will also simplify the tax system. The present complications foster tax avoidance and unfairly favour those who can afford a tax accountant or lawyer. The ownership of personal wealth must be spread more widely, estate duty will be replaced by a graded legacy duty and a tax on gifts paid by the recipients. The burden of tax on those who earn must be reduced by spreading the indirect tax net, taxing capital gains over a longer period and stopping tax dodges.  We will introduce equal pay for women for equal work and give women greater legal rights in marriage particularly in regard to property, the guardianship of children and the enforcement of maintenance orders.  We shall make it easier for married women to return to work without disrupting the home, by encouraging part-time work, improving training and retraining, removing tax disabilities and introducing an allowance for child minders.  COST OF LIVING  A pound in 1951 is worth only 13s. 0d. today. The rising cost of living penalises people on fixed incomes, pensioners and many people in every walk of life.  Liberals will check the rise in prices by action against monopolies and price rings; tariff cuts and tax policy. These measures to spread the fruits of higher productivity to the consumer are the key to a just incomes policy. In particular we will outlaw certain restrictive practices and make take-over bids and mergers, subject to public scrutiny.  Fair trade legislation will protect the consumer against shoddy goods, misleading labels and markings up. It will also protect the shopkeeper against discrimination by suppliers who squeeze our retailers by withholding discounts which they give to their competitors.  The wrangle about nationalisation and denationalisation is irrelevant to most of the problems of modern industry.  Liberals want a truce in the dispute over steel which will take the industry out of politics and enable it to get on with the job. We press instead for modernisation of the industry, government help for redundancy, competitive marketing, and a world steel conference to cut tariffs and agree on world rules of competition.  In the past ten years more has been wasted by the Conservative Government on abandoned defence projects and other matters than the whole school building programme. Waste in government will not be cut out unless the best brains of the country are brought into administration from industry and the universities.  The House of Commons must also have better control over public spending and the formulation of policy on economic affairs, foreign policy and defence. Specialised parliamentary committees on these matters, empowered to call on experts, should be set up to allow more time for broad debates in the House and permit M.P.s with specialised knowledge to share in framing policy.  Back bench M.P.s must be given more freedom to influence legislation. There must be more free voting, except on matters of confidence. to enliven debate and give it meaning. The House of Commons must be brought into closer contact with people, especially young people. A royal commission should consider extending the franchise to those over 18.  A PROSPEROUS COUNTRYSIDE  Increased earnings for farmers and farm workers are necessary to create a prosperous countryside.  Liberals will set up meat and grain commissions to manage the market for both home and imported produce so that the farmer gets the bulk of his income from the market and the housewife is assured regular supplies at reasonable prices.  We will allocate a larger share of Government money to stock improvement and projects for technical advance, capital aid to small farmers and schemes for group farming and co-operative marketing.  A Land Bank will be set up to make credit available to genuine farmers at low interest rates, thus creating conditions in which agricultural productivity can expand.  We will bring down the cost of farm materials through improved distribution, grading and marketing so that both the housewife and the farmer benefit.  THE FUTURE FACE OF BRITAIN  The skills and potential wealth of Britain will not be fully used if people continue to drift to the south-east.  In order to establish a proper balance between the regions, there must be a broad national plan on the movement of population, the location of industry, new towns and transport.  The key note of this national plan will be the decentralisation of power and wealth from London. In Wales, Scotland and the north and west of England, there are plenty of able men and women who could make a bigger contribution to the running of their own affairs. These untapped resources will not be released unless political power to make decisions is brought back to the people they concern.  A Scottish Parliament must be set up so that Scottish domestic affairs will receive the informed attention which Westminster cannot provide.  A Council for Wales will be established and a Secretary of State for Wales appointed. A Welsh development agency will be set up to plan, to lend money and to promote new industries. It will give special attention to the problem of mid-Wales. In Scotland a Highland development authority will be set up to arrest depopulation, and promote industrial and rural development.  Northern Ireland will also benefit from the policy of devolving power from London. The Liberal plan will provide broader regional tax advantages for Northern Ireland.  Liberals seek also to help the different religions and groups of Northern Ireland to live peaceably together without mutual discrimination or intolerance. A Bill of Rights should guarantee the citizen against discrimination.  REGIONAL GOVERNMENT  Throughout Britain regional authorities must be set up responsible, ultimately through elected regional councils, to the regions they represent. They must draw up regional plans and have the power to build new towns to counter the attraction of the congested areas. Today Whitehall ministries allocate school and hospital building funds or give permission for the siting of new factories. Such powers must be decentralised to the regional authorities so that the people who live in a region have responsibility for their homes, schools and jobs.  Regional planning also proves a key to transport policy. The Buchanan Report on ""Traffic in Towns"" is at present no more than a scrap of paper. Regional authorities will have the powers and resources to help local authorities reshape our cities so that they can be pleasant places to live in. They must be empowered to provide specific subsidies to bus or rail services in rural areas to keep remote communities alive.  Transport shapes the future of our country, yet investment in roads, docks and railways, for decades, has lagged far behind the country's needs. A comprehensive national motorway network must be built. East long distance rail transport must be developed further and antiquated docks modernised within the framework of regional plans.  HOMES FOR ALL  The chronic housing shortage can and must be ended and slums cleared within 10 years. This means progressively raising the building programme to at least 500,000 homes a year.  The regional authorities can once more provide the drive. Many of our 1,400 local housing authorities are tied to old-fashioned building methods because they can only build on a minute scale. Only regional authorities can help place orders on an industrial scale and make full use of modern techniques.  Vigorous action is needed to train more skilled men and eliminate restrictive practices and price rings in the building industry. Standards must be raised and jerry-building eliminated by the adoption of a national building code. The rate of slum clearance must be trebled to 180,000 dwellings a year, based on a national building survey. A land development corporation will provide capital funds and teams of experts to rebuild city centres.  MORE HOME OWNERSHIP  House ownership must be brought within the reach of all. To bring down the cost of mortgages, profits and income tax on the surpluses of building societies must be abolished. Government guarantees for mortgages for periods of up to 30 or 35 years will help young married couples by spreading the period of repayment. Fuller use should be made by local authorities of their powers to grant 100 per cent. home loans.  Rented homes in Britain tend either to be hopelessly expensive, derelict, or severely limited by a lengthy housing list. Here the only real answer is to build more houses and end the housing shortage. Non-profit-making housing associations could expand further if they are given more help by teams of architects and other experts which the regional authorities can afford to employ. The Rent Act must be modified to allow longer periods of notice and the reimposition of controls on landlords who demand extortionate rents.  LAND PRICES  Liberals will check the rise in land prices by stimulating development away from the south-east; they will abolish the present unfair system of rating and replace it with a scheme based on site value rating. This would encourage development and better use of land, lower the burden of rates on the householder and ensure that the community shares in any rise in land values.  A SOCIAL CHARTER  Britain's social security system, pioneered by two great Liberals - Lloyd George and Beveridge - now needs bringing up to date. The old age pension must be high enough for people to live on without national assistance and linked to the national income so that pensioners share in the growing national wealth. The minimum state pension must be fixed at half the average national earnings - £8 l0s. and £5 5s. respectively for the married and single pensioner today.  The National Assistance Board should ultimately be abolished when the need for it has disappeared, once the basic pension is raised. The earnings rule, which stops elderly people who draw a pension from earning a bit more, must also go. Widows pensions must be brought into line with the nation's growing wealth.  Insurance stamps will be abolished. Social security should be financed by a social security tax levied in proportion to their pay roll, on employers two-thirds and employees one-third. Revenue for social security benefits would thus automatically rise with earnings.  Everyone must have the chance to supplement the basic state pension through an occupational scheme, paying a benefit of up to at least two-thirds of their own previous earnings, subject to a maximum and a minimum. Employers without a private scheme would contribute to a central fund to finance individual savings schemes.  The Liberal aim is to enable everyone in need or in old age to receive two-thirds of their previous pay through a combination of the basic benefit and an occupational scheme.  BETTER HEALTH SERVICES  The health services are crippled by A shortage of doctors, dentists and nurses. Hospital beds are empty for lack of staff. Liberals will encourage qualified doctors to practise by reforming methods of payment and introducing refresher courses; we will review the wage and career set-up of nursing and make it easier for married women to nurse part-time.  Prescription charges must be abolished. They create hardship for those least able to bear it the old, the ill, the unemployed. Savings can be made in administration and through the bulk buying of drugs on a regional scale.  An expectant mother, or an elderly person, is often treated by several separate branches of the health and welfare services. We will end this wasteful duplication by setting up area health boards, which bring together the whole range of health and welfare services. The G.P. would have a leading position in this team, and thus recover the scope and opportunity he often lacks today.  REFORM THE LAW  Liberals will switch the emphasis in combating crime to prevention and rehabilitation. We will expand the police force and the probation service, improve pay and conditions to attract high quality recruits. To reduce the prison population, we will make greater use of alternatives to imprisonment; extend experiments in prison reform and remand procedure; improve after-care service, and appoint independent inspectors to visit prisons and investigate complaints.  INVEST IN PEOPLE  Education decides the country's economic future and shapes our children's lives.  Here priorities are all important. The crux of our educational problem is the teacher shortage, and the first priority is to bring about a massive expansion of teacher training.  Liberals propose to double full time places in higher education in the next 10 years. Then the men and women will be available to reduce the size of classes and eliminate the slum schools. Special attention will be given to the primary and infant schools, where neglect has been worst.  Teaching as a career must be made more attractive by an improved salary structure, service conditions and pensions. New methods of teaching must be developed and financial rewards given to teachers who improve their skills. The setting up of new machinery for negotiating teachers' pay to replace the broken Burnham system is overdue.  The 11-plus exam must go. It is socially divisive and unfair in its results. We will encourage forms of non-selective secondary education, ranging from the campus system to the Leicestershire type schemes and the comprehensive school. This cannot be left to local authorities alone. The Government must help, especially with cash for buildings.  PARTNERSHIP IN THE WORLD  The Liberal aim is a true world order, based on controlled disarmament and a world-wide rule of law. This cannot come overnight. In the meantime Britain must work to build up a partnership between regional groups of nations consistent with the U.N. Charter.  Although the U.N. is not fully effective there is no alternative to accept a wider loyalty and this world institution gradually assumes new tasks and takes on real power. In particular we shall press for the establishment of a permanent U.N. force to maintain peace in areas of tension.  Britain is part of Europe and could have played a prominent part in the United Europe movement. Instead the Labour and Conservative parties dragged their feet. Today Britain is paying the price for these hesitations. Exports to the Common Market are faltering; the West as a whole suffers from growing political division.  In the course of the next Parliament, the chance to join a European Political and Economic Community may come again. This opportunity must not be thrown away. A strong force of Liberal M.P.s could decide this historic question.  TOWARDS A WELFARE WORLD  A joint Western programme of aid and trade is essential to defeat world poverty. The Freedom from Hunger campaign has shown the way. A world food plan must play a systematic part in development programmes. World commodity stabilisation schemes can steady prices of raw materials exported by developing countries and, incidentally, help to bring Britain into closer partnership with Europe. Britain must press for joint Western policies to lower trade barriers to manufacturers from the new nations.  In the second half of this century racial bitterness may be the gravest danger for mankind. Liberals reject racial discrimination for they believe fundamentally in the brotherhood of man. In Africa there can be no compromise with apartheid. Shipments of arms to South Africa should be stopped.  COMMONWEALTH DEVELOPMENT  Britain has a special role to play in Commonwealth development. A Commonwealth Service must be set up, recruited from all the member countries, to cover the whole range of technical help needed by developing countries. An imaginative effort must be made to extend Voluntary Service Overseas. On immigration and race problems Liberals will take the initiative in setting up a system of Commonwealth consultation towards an agreed policy for immigration, exclusion and expulsion and the rights of political asylum.  WORLD PEACE AND SECURITY  No real progress will be made towards world peace and security until Governments accept that complete national independence is impossible in a world threatened by nuclear warfare. The attempt to maintain an independent British range of nuclear weapons has encouraged the proliferation of nuclear weapons, weakened our economy, and deprived our conventional forces of resources they desperately need.  Liberals will shift the emphasis to building up our conventional forces, so that Britain can fulfill its world-wide obligations until an effective U.N. force takes over. We will seek influence, not by buying American Polaris missiles at an eventual cost of some £600 m., but by pressing for new and effective NATO political institutions such as a powerful political-military secretariat to plan strategy based on a European Political Community within a true Atlantic partnership.  Collective control of nuclear weapons within NATO could be an important step towards disarmament.  Britain can best contribute by integrating TSR2 and our V bombers into the NATO structure.  We must also take the initiative in the disarmament discussions by pressing for a freeze on the development of nuclear strategic weapons; working to establish nuclear free zones; considering proposals for inspection against surprise attack; pressing for the admission of China to the disarmament discussions.  THE LIBERAL CHALLENGE  This Liberal programme is designed to benefit the country as a whole.  At home Liberals have bold policies to reconstruct Britain and create a new spirit of partnership. Abroad they seek to apply the same spirit of partnership to world affairs.  A positive Liberal purpose in Westminster is required to ensure that the will of the people is done.  If all the people who vote negatively to keep the other side out, lend their support to this programme, a decisive Liberal influence will be certain in the next Parliament.  Think for yourself - Vote Liberal."
"Conservatives",196410,"""PROSPERITY WITH A PURPOSE""  Foreward  by Sir Alec Douglas-Home  As Leader of the Conservative and Unionist Party, I submit this Manifesto to my fellow countrymen and women.  Its object is to declare the principles for which Conservatives stand and to show how we propose to translate them into action. Part of it is a record of achievement, and that is deliberate. For work well done carries conviction that our policies for the future will succeed. Our philosophy is to use what is good from the past to create a future which is better.  But these pages are not an introduction to an easy, sheltered life. No country has an inherited right to wealth or influence. Prosperity has to be worked for. The future will be assured only if our people recognise the simple economic rules which must be kept by a country dependent on earning its living in a competitive world. This manifesto points the way.  Throughout, you will find a constant theme. It is the creation of a social and economic climate in which men and women can develop their personalities and talents to their country's benefit as well as their own. Conservatives believe that a centralised system of direction cramps the style of the British people. Only by trusting the individual with freedom and responsibility shall we gain the vitality to keep our country great.  Such greatness is not measured in terms of prosperity alone. What counts is the purpose to which we put prosperity. The Conservative purpose is clear from our record and from our programme. It is to raise the quality of our society and its influence for good in the world. We are using the growth of wealth to expand opportunities for the young, to provide more generously for the old and the sick and the handicapped, to aid developing countries still battling against widespread poverty, and to maintain the strength on which national security and our work for peace depend.  In a world as dangerous as that in which we live it can make no sense whatever for Britain unilaterally to discard her strength. We therefore reject the idea of giving up our nuclear arm. We adopt instead a balanced policy of strength and conciliation: strength to be used to stop wars before they start; conciliation to reach areas of agreement with the Soviet Union and the Communist world which will replace tension and potential conflict. The Nuclear Test Ban Treaty was one such achievement. We mean to work for more until the danger of war is eliminated. The way will be rough but we will persevere. I ask you to conclude that we should retain British power and influence so that they may be used for such high purpose.  In short, I trust that the values for which Conservatives stand and the policies which we intend to follow commend themselves to the imagination and the common sense of the British people.  WORKING FOR PEACE  Our policy of peace through strength has brought Britain safely through years of tension and danger. it contributes to the security of the free world. It provides the realistic basis for better relations between East and West. It keeps this country in her rightful place at the centre of international affairs.  The Socialists, by contrast, would relegate Britain to the sidelines. They are as always deeply divided on international and defence issues so divided that they dared not even discuss them at their last party conference lest an open quarrel should break out. Nuclear abdication is the only policy on which they can unite.  DIPLOMACY AND DISARMAMENT  The Nuclear Test Ban Treaty of 1963 has been welcomed throughout the world. Both the United States and the Soviet Union have acknowledged how much it owed to the Conservative Government's initiative and perseverance. But if Labour Party policy had been carried out, and our country had no longer been a nuclear power, there would have been no British role to play. We should have been without influence and without voice. The Conservative Party will not cast away by unilateral action this vital contribution to Britain's diplomacy and defence.  We are ready and anxious not only to stop all tests but to discard further armaments - if other nations agree to do the same and give convincing proof that they are doing so step by step with us. That is what we are trying to achieve in the general disarmament negotiations. That is what we pledge ourselves to work for.  Following upon the test ban treaty, the Russians, Americans and ourselves have this year agreed to limit production of fissile materials for military purposes. in accord with our allies, we shall seek other areas of agreement with the Soviet Union-for example, on non-dissemination of nuclear weapons and observation posts against surprise attack. It would be wrong to raise false hopes, for the Russians are stubborn negotiators and these are difficult matters. But we are determined to maintain the momentum of constructive discussion which has already done much to bring nearer an end to the cold war.  DEFENCE AND DETERRENCE  A Conservative Government will firmly uphold Britain's world-wide interests and obligations. In recent months we have been called upon to defend Malaysia and South Arabia and to render assistance in East Africa and Cyprus. These crises have demonstrated the effectiveness of our defence organisation and the skill and spirit of our fighting Services. We shall continue to ensure that they are equipped to respond swiftly and successfully to challenge.  Over 90 per cent. of our defence effort is devoted to conventional arms. But in the nuclear age no money spent on increasing the size or improving the conventional equipment of our forces could by itself secure the defence of these islands. The only effective defence is the certainty in the mind of any enemy that there is no prize he could ever win by our defeat which could compensate him for the destruction he would suffer in the process. Conservatives do not accept the view that we could never be threatened on our own, or that an enemy will always assume we shall have allies rushing to our side.  Britain must in the ultimate resort have independently controlled nuclear power to deter an aggressor. We possess this power today. Only under a Conservative Government will we possess it in the future.  We have put into practice the concept of interdependence within the Atlantic alliance by assigning our V-bombers to Nato but subject to our right to deploy them at discretion if supreme national interests are at stake. The Polaris submarines when operational will be assigned in the same way and subject to the same reservation.  WESTERN UNITY AND THE U.N.  We remain convinced that the political and economic problems of the West can best be solved by an Atlantic partnership between America and a united Europe. Only in this way can Europe develop the wealth and power, and play the part in aiding others, to which her resources and history point the way.  Entry into the European Economic Community is not open to us in existing circumstances, and no question of fresh negotiations can arise at present. We shall work, with our EFTA partners, through the Council of Europe, and through Western European Union, for the closest possible relations with the Six consistent with our Commonwealth ties.  The principles laid down in the Charter of the United Nations are as valid today as when we signed it. We shall use our influence to see that these principles are implemented. Our contribution to the U.N.'s economic and social agencies and to its work of conciliation and peace-making is second only to that of the United States. We shall work for the establishment of its present peace-keeping machinery on a more permanent basis.  THE ROLE OF THE COMMONWEALTH  The Prime Ministers' Conference this summer reflected the vigour and increased the strength of the modern Commonwealth. In a few weeks' time it will comprise 20 nations 13 of whom will have achieved their independence since the Conservatives took office.  This historic evolution is now reaching its final stages. Of our remaining dependencies many are well on the road to sovereignty. A number have multi-racial populations presenting special problems. Others are too small to bear the burdens of separate statehood. In each case we shall work for a fair and practical solution which will protect the interests of the peoples concerned.  The organisation of government in this country and the machinery of Commonwealth co-operation will be brought into line with new conditions.  We propose next year to merge the Colonial Office with the Commonwealth Relations Office, and it and the Foreign Office will be staffed from a single Diplomatic Service.  We shall give full support to the Commonwealth Secretariat whose establishment was agreed at the Prime Ministers' Conference. We also intend to set up a Commonwealth Foundation to develop contacts between professional bodies in the Commonwealth, and will give increased assistance to the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association.  TRADE AND AID  Today the Commonwealth faces two world challenges. One is political the opportunity to show by example that peoples of different races can work together in amity and confidence. The other is economic the need to build up in developing territories more prosperous and hopeful conditions. We shall succeed in the political task only if we also succeed in the economic. For it is the gap in living standards between the industrialised and the developing that gives racial conflict its cutting edge.  The prime need of developing countries is for trading opportunities, and here Britain leads the world. No country is so liberal in providing them with access to her markets. At the United Nations trade and development conference this year we played a crucial role in securing the adoption of recommendations to help them expand, export and earn. Our consistent aim is wider world trade and an improved world monetary system to sustain it.  Under the Conservatives since 1951, £l,400m. has been provided in Government aid, preponderantly to the Commonwealth. Last year it reached the record level of £175m., more than double what it was six years earlier. Private investment has been providing substantial amounts. As the British economy expands, so the level of aid will progressively rise. We shall also support voluntary endeavour, of which the Freedom from Hunger Campaign has been a splendid example.  TECHNICAL CO-OPERATION  But aid is more than money. Just as vital is the sharing of knowledge and experience. We have multiplied our technical assistance more than sixfold in six years. We set up the new Department of Technical Co-operation in 1961 to give impetus to this work.  More than 50,000 students from developing countries were in full-time courses in Britain last year, while some 19,000 British men and women were serving in the developing countries under our Government 5 auspices. An important feature has been the growing opportunity for young people to find scope for their energy and idealism in voluntary overseas service. Through the initiative of voluntary organisations, and with increasing Government support, the numbers are rising fast.  At the 1964 Commonwealth Education Conference we offered a big increase in capital assistance for high education in the Commonwealth during the coming five years. We shall also vigorously pursue our proposals for a Commonwealth medical conference, and for increasing Commonwealth co-operation in development projects and in the training of administrators.  In these ways we shall seek both to help the developing countries and to strengthen Commonwealth links.  GROWTH WITHOUT INFLATION  In 13 years of Conservative government the living standards of the British people have improved more than in the whole of the previous half-century.  The working population is up by two million and over 98 per cent. are in jobs. Rising incomes and lower taxes have made possible a spectacular increase in spending on the essentials, the comforts and what were once regarded as the luxuries of life. At the same time personal savings have grown from £lOOm. in 1951 to nearly £2,OOOm. last year-providing funds for the modernisation of Britain, security for the individual, and substance to the Conservative concept of a property-owning democracy.  We do not claim that these benefits are the gift of the Government. What we do claim is that the Government has created conditions in which individuals by enterprise and thrift have gained these benefits for themselves and the country. These are the conditions we shall maintain.  AN EXPANDING ECONOMY  We shall give first priority to our policy for economic growth, so that Britain's national wealth can expand by a steady 4 per cent. per year.  We recognise that this involves a high level of imports, and we are prepared to draw on our reserves whilst our exports, both visible and invisible, achieve a balance with them. By new arrangements with the International Monetary Fund, the European banks and the United States, we have strengthened the defences of sterling against speculative attack which could put a brake on progress.  But the long-term problem of the balance of payments can only be solved by bringing our trading economy to the highest pitch of competitiveness and modern efficiency.  EXPORTS AND PRICES  We have improved the services provided for export firms, given them the fullest credit insurance facilities in the world, and established the National Export Council to aid their efforts. But basically our capacity to sell abroad depends on competitive prices.  No country has succeeded in keeping post-war prices completely steady, but Britain in recent years has done far better than most. Our aim is an economy in which earnings rise in step with productivity and do not outpace it. An effective and fair incomes policy is crucial to the achievement of sustained growth without inflation. We shall take a further initiative to secure wider acceptance and effective implementation of such a policy. In addition, a downward pressure on prices will be increasingly exerted by Conservative measures to stimulate industrial competition.  N.E.D.C. AND PLANNING  We have set up the National Economic Development Council, bringing together Government, management and unions in a co-operative venture to improve our economic performance. This has been followed by the establishment of Economic Development Committees for a number of individual industries.  N.E.D.C. gives reality to the democratic concept of planning by partnership. In contemporary politics the argument is not for or against planning. All human activity involves planning. The question is: how is the planning to be done? By consent or by compulsion?  The Labour Party's policy of extended State ownership and centralised control would be economically disastrous and incompatible with the opportunities and responsibilities of a free society. Conservatives believe that a democratic country as mature as ours must be self-disciplined and not State-controlled, law-abiding without being regulation-ridden, co-operative but not coerced.  MODERNISATION AND COMPETITION  Record progress is being made in modernising industry. Today capital investment in new factories, construction, plant and equipment is twice as high as when the Socialists left office. Our financial incentives for this purpose are now the best in the world, and we shall see that tax policies continue to stimulate industrial innovation.  SCIENCE AND INDUSTRY  Britain's total spending on civil scientific research and development has more than trebled since the mid-1950s. In this effort Government and industry have shared.  We shall further improve the organisation for promoting civil science by setting up new research councils. An industrial research and development authority will be formed to undertake basic and applied work of importance to industry.  Economic efficiency and increasing leisure have always depended on supplementing human with mechanical effort, and increasingly mechanisation must extend to the control systems which link and co-ordinate the machines. It is an important feature of our policy to encourage the wider spread of automated equipment. The National Research Development Corporation, with extended powers and finance, will be helped to sponsor the application of such new techniques in industry.  Whilst recognising the Government's obligation to assist in these ways, we are convinced that the rapidly changing world of industrial technology is the last place for Socialism. It calls for a flexibility, and a response to new ideas and requirements, which a system of free competitive enterprise is best suited to provide. The Conservative Party is utterly opposed to any extension of nationalisation, whether outright or piecemeal. We propose to complete the denationalisation of steel. Industries in public ownership will continue to be developed as modern businesses.  COMPETITION AND THE CONSUMER  In private industry and trade we intend to stimulate the forces of competition which make for efficiency and bring down prices. Abolition of resale price maintenance, save in cases where it can be shown to serve the public interest, will have this effect on retail trade. In the next Parliament our first major Bill will be one to strengthen the Monopolies Commission, speed up its work, and enlarge the Government's powers to implement its recommendations. It will enable us to deal with any merger or takeover bid likely to lead to harmful monopoly conditions.  We shall reform the Companies Act, so as to take account of modern developments and give added protection to investors.  Competition and free choice are the customers' most effective safeguards. We welcome the many signs of growing consumer awareness and influence, and have established and will finance the Consumer Council as a spokesman for these interests. We shall follow up our reform of hire purchase and weights and measures by improving merchandise marks legislation, and by strengthening the Sale of Goods Act so as to secure greater protection for shoppers in such matters as warranties and guarantees.  The restrictions on shop hours, which are particularly inconvenient for the growing number of women at work, are being reviewed. Our aim is to achieve greater flexibility in the present arrangements, while maintaining necessary safeguards for shop-workers.  FULL EMPLOYMENT  We believe that a growing and competitive economy must redeploy its resources to meet or anticipate changes in markets, methods and machines. But the interests of those who work in industry must be fully safeguarded in the process. Otherwise responses to change could act as a brake on modernisation and rising standards.  REDUNDANCY AND RETRAINING  The Government is helping industry to plan its manpower requirements ahead so that unnecessary redundancies are avoided. Our new Contracts of Employment Act gives employees for the first time statutory rights to a minimum period of notice. We attach great importance to the wider extension of arrangements whereby redundant workers are compensated by their employers through severance payments.  In the next Parliament we shall reform the unemployment benefit under the national insurance scheme. Men and women with earnings above a minimum level will be able to receive for sonic months a graduated supplement to their flat-rate benefit. Their total benefit will thus be more closely related to their normal standard of living, and those unable to find a new job right away will be protected against a sharp fall in income. Some workers who fall ill may suffer comparable financial hardship, and a similar change will be made in sickness benefit. Our detailed scheme will be put forward when we have completed our discussions with representatives of the interests concerned.  We are at present carrying through in Government training centres a doubling of the facilities for retraining men and women in new skills. In addition, the industrial training boards which are being set up under our new legislation will stimulate industries particularly those that are expanding to provide greatly improved systems of apprenticeship, training and retraining.  REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT  Our programme of regional development will expand employment prospects, make the maximum use of national resources and spread prosperity more evenly throughout the United Kingdom. In this way, the potentialities of each region can be developed to the utmost and at the same time its characteristics retained.  This programme combines the provision of better communications, up-to-date social services and improved amenities with generous inducements to build new factories, install modern equipment and provide fresh jobs where they are most required. Its object is to make each region a more efficient place to work in and a more attractive place to live in. Our studies for this purpose now cover Wales, Scotland and most of England.  In central Scotland and north-east England we are already carrying out programmes without precedent in conception and scale. Their impact is evident in the renewed activity and growing buoyancy of these areas which are looking, not towards the problems of the past, but to the technological developments of the future. Thus the places which pioneered the first industrial revolution will become full partners in the second.  In south-east England our programme will ensure proper development to meet the needs of the natural growth of population. New cities and towns and urban expansions will be built to provide work and homes away from the capital. Consultations are now being held about the location and size of these developments, which will be carried out without prejudicing growth elsewhere. We are determined to check the drift to the south and to achieve a sound balance over the whole country.  A Conservative Government will continue to control immigration from overseas according to the numbers which our crowded country and its industrial regions can absorb. We shall ensure that the working of the Commonwealth Immigrants Act, which we passed in 1962 against bitter Labour Party opposition, is fair and effective.  INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS  All these measures to protect and expand employment should help reduce industrial disputes. They also highlight the lack of justification in present conditions for many restrictive practices of labour.  The trade unions have a vital responsibility to diminish such handicaps to Britain's competitive strength. We shall continue to seek their co-operation in matters of common interest and to work in partnership with them through N.E.D.C.  Recent decisions in the courts have thrown into promin2nce aspects of the law affecting trade unions and employers' associations. The law has not been reviewed since the beginning of the century, and it will be the subject of an early inquiry.  BRITAIN ON THE MOVE  We shall press ahead with improving and reshaping the transport system to fit the needs of a modern Britain.  The first essential is to make the best possible provision for the increase in private motoring which prosperity brings. Since the 1959 election we have carried out a £600m. programme of new road building. During the next five years £1 ~50m will be devoted to this purpose.  On our present plans the first thousand miles of Britain's motorway system will be completed in 1973. In addition ~ shall improve hundreds of miles of trunk roads. A modern system of road signs will be installed, and we shall concentrate on measures to increase safety.  We are putting particular emphasis on reducing traffic congestion in towns. In the longer term, we shall apply the principles of the Buchanan Report to comprehensive campaigns of town replanning. As an immediate step, expenditure on urban roads will be trebled. In London big improvements in traffic flow have resulted from overall management by the Traffic Management Unit: we shall arrange with the other major conurbations for the same methods to be applied by them.  PUBLIC TRANSPORT  We shall complete the Victoria Underground line, and will encourage the development and use of new techniques for public transport in the towns. In six rural areas pilot schemes are being started to provide better bus services in some cases with financial support from the Government and county councils. fly mid-1965 we hope to extend' such schemes to other parts of the countryside.  Under the Beeching Plan we are producing an economic railway system able to attract suitable traffic off the roads by its own efficiency. A faster and more reliable rail service is increasingly being provided on the busy main lines for passengers and freight, and millions of pounds have already been knocked off the railway losses. We shall not consent to the closure of any service where this will damage economic development or cause undue hardship. Alternative bus services, with facilities for luggage. will be provided where necessary.  SEA AND AIR  Britain's ports are now entering a new era when great development schemes will be carried through to the benefit of our trade. We have supported our shipowners against foreign interference and passed the Shipping Contracts Act which will protect British interests. We affirm our faith in the future of the shipbuilding industry whose current prospects have been much improved by our credits scheme.  We intend to press ahead with negotiations for the Channel Tunnel so that an early start can be made.  In developing efficient air communications we believe that a combination of public and private enterprise is best. We shall encourage the growth of a network of internal air services and airports to meet local needs.  PROGRESS ON THE LAND  On our farms productivity has been rising by 5 per cent. a year. Output is approaching twice what it was before the war. Modernisation is proceeding apace under the Farm Improvement Scheme and the Small Farmers Scheme.  British agriculture is efficient and competitive, and makes an indispensable contribution to our economic and social strength.  The Conservative Government has evolved a system of support which has provided a sound basis for this progress. It is being adapted now to changed world conditions. Agreements have been reached with our overseas suppliers to regulate imports of cereals and bacon, and we shall continue to work for a stable market for meat. These policies are in line with our desire to conclude world-wide agreements for key commodities. Together with the improvement we shall bring about in marketing arrangements for home products, they will assure British farmers of a fair share of a growing market.  In developing our policies we shall continue to uphold the principles of the 1947 and 1957 Agriculture Acts. With imports regulated and home production more effectively related to market needs through standard quantity systems, greater weight can be given to farmers' returns at future price reviews. The long-term assurances under our 1957 Act will continue throughout the life of the next Parliament.  Our new deal for horticulture will strengthen the industry's ability to compete. We offer substantial aid to growers to adopt the most up-to-date production and marketing methods. Horticultural markets in major cities will be rebuilt, and the sites better related to modern traffic conditions. This will help to get the produce to housewives quicker, fresher and cheaper.  FORESTRY AND FISHERIES  The Forestry Commission will carry through a long-term programme of planting. especially in areas where expansion can bring social and employment benefits. We will continue our help to private woodland owners.  We have extended British fishery limits in accordance with the recently negotiated convention, and will further promote the technical progress and prosperity of the fishing industry.  Powers of river authorities to ensure proper conservation of fisheries will be extended.  With the aid of river authorities and the new Water Resources Board we shall develop a national policy of water conservation, so ensuring adequate supplies to meet increasing demand.  WAYS AND MEANS  The programme we propose for the next five years is an ambitious one; but we know it can be achieved, for it is based on 13 years of solid progress. It embraces rising investment in the modernisation of Britain, on the lines we have described, and rising expenditure on the social services.  The money must be found from two sources: the savings of the nation and the contributions of taxpayer and ratepayer. We have never disguised that the cost will be heavy. No programme worthy of this country can be cheap. But it must be kept within bounds, and related to the growth of the national income. Our proposals are based on our target of a 4 per cent. annual growth rate, and on maintaining a high level of savings.  One thing is quite certain. The Labour Party's promises would cost many hundreds of millions more than our programme. At the same time their policies would discourage enterprise and savings. The result could only be renewed inflation and rapidly rising taxes.  INCENTIVES TO SAVE  To secure a still higher volume of savings, a Conservative Government will introduce new incentives. In particular we aim to devise a contractual savings scheme, giving attractive benefits to those who undertake to save regularly over a period of years.  We shall also encourage the successful efforts which are being made to widen the field of share ownership.  TAXPAYER AND RATEPAYER  We shall continue to reform the tax system, both on companies and on individuals, to make it less complicated and fairer in its incidence.  Local authority services are expanding in response to public need and demand, but in some instances and areas the cost is outpacing the capacity of householders to pay. We recognise that a reform of the rates is required. The precise scale and methods will be determined as soon as our full inquiries, now in progress, are complete. These inquiries which could not have been undertaken effectively until revaluation had been carried through-cover the whole rating system, potential sources of local authority finance, the impact of rates now, and the current Exchequer grants.  In the light of these studies we shall ensure that the cost of local government, and particularly of education, is fairly apportioned between ratepayers and taxpayers, as well as making changes in the system of grants. In carrying out these and any other necessary reforms, we shall bear specially in mind those householders living on small fixed incomes.  OPPORTUNITY FOR YOUTH  Education is the most rapidly developing feature of our social outlay. Its share of the expanded national wealth has risen since 1951 from 3 per cent. to 5 per cent., and will go on rising. This reflects our view of education as at once a right of the child, a need of society, and a condition of economic efficiency. It also matches a tremendous upsurge in educational ambition and attainment.  THE PARTY MANIFESTOS  Our aim is to see that suitable education or training is available to every boy and girl up to at least 18. These are the steps we shall take:  1. The minimum school-leaving age will be raised to 16 for all who enter secondary school after the summer of 1967. This, which we looked forward to in the 1944 Education Act, is not to be just ""another year at school"". The whole school course will be refashioned to give a wider and deeper education.  2. More and more who have the ability to benefit will stay on to 17 and 18 and go forward to higher education. This will be made possible by our plans for the universities, colleges of advanced technology, higher technical institutions and teacher training colleges. There will be places for 100,000 extra students by 1968, and for a steadily growing number after that.  3. For those leaving school to start work at once, we shall further develop the Youth Employment Service and encourage the appointment by schools of careers advisers of high calibre, as well as improving industrial apprenticeship and training. Steps will be taken to increase the number of industrial workers under 18 who are released during the day to attend technical and other courses. We shall continue our great expansion of technical colleges.  BUILDINGS AND TEACHERS  The building of new schools and the modernising of existing ones will be pressed ahead. The rising school population will put heavy pressure on our resources, but we are determined to devote a share of each year's programme to improving conditions in the older primary schools.  The training colleges will be producing by 1970 three times as many new teachers as in 1958, and the larger numbers going on to higher education will mean more teachers later on. We shall sustain our successful campaign for the return of qualified married women to teaching. Improved machinery will be established for the negotiation of teachers salaries.  RESEARCH AND ORGANISATION  We shall continue to encourage educational research and provide extra funds for this purpose.  Of the many different forms of secondary school organisation which now exist, none has established itself as exclusively right. The Socialist plan to impose the comprehensive principle, regardless of the wishes of parents, teachers and authorities, is therefore foolishly doctrinaire. Their leader may protest that grammar schools will be abolished ' over his dead body"", but abolition would be the inevitable and disastrous consequence of the policy to which they are committed. Conservative policy, by contrast, is to encourage provision, in good schools of every description, of opportunities for all children to go forward to the limit of their capacity.  THE YOUTH SERVICE  Beyond the gates of school, college and factory, young people need ample facilities for social activity and outlets for adventure and service.  As we promised in 1959, the Youth Service has been rejuvenated through the building of new clubs and the training of capable leaders. We shall press forward with this work, encourage more courses of the ' Outward Bound"" type, and foster schemes whereby young people can assist the elderly.  RE-SHAPING SOCIAL SECURITY  Under Conservatism the value of social security benefits has outpaced both prices and average earnings; under Socialism they were eaten away by inflation. We pledge ourselves to ensure that those receiving such benefits continue to share in the higher standards produced by an expanding economy.  Help will be concentrated first and foremost on those whose needs are greatest. Special insurance provision has already been directed to widows with children. When next we make a general increase in benefits, we shall give preferential treatment to the older pensioners.  Those who work after retirement age, and widows at work, have benefited from a steady relaxation of the earnings rule "". In the next Parliament we shall again progressively raise the amounts they can earn without deduction of pension.  Our graduated pension scheme, started in 1961, embodied the principle that retirement pensions should be more closely related to individual earnings. As we have explained, we are now proposing to extend this principle to benefits for the early months of unemployment and sickness, and we shall give similar help to widows during the early months of widowhood.  GENERAL REVIEW  All these proposals will make important improvements in the existing social security system. This system was framed 20 years ago, and in the light of pre-war experience. Since then there have been dramatic changes in economic conditions and social needs. We therefore propose to institute a full review of social security arrangements, so that their subsequent development may be suited to modern circumstances.  The review will not be confined to the national insurance scheme, but will include industrial injuries insurance, the varying provisions for widows, and the method of supplementing benefits.  PENSION RIGHTS  In organising social security the State ought not to stifle personal and family responsibility or the growth of sound occupational schemes. Socialist plans would do precisely that. We Conservatives welcome the valuable additional security which occupational schemes provide, and will help to preserve such pension rights for people changing jobs.  We shall continue to make special provision for war widows and those disabled in the service of their country. The level of pensions for retired members of the armed forces and other Government servants will be adjusted as necessary. In the next Pensions Increase Act we shall reduce the age at which such pension increases are payable from 60 to 55.  THE HOUSING PROGRAMME  One family in every four is living in a new home built under the Conservatives. More than half of the million houses classified as unfit when our slum clearance drive began have been replaced. One third of the 2,500,000 older houses capable of improvement have been given a new lease of life with the aid of Government grant.  This is a vast achievement; but there is much more to do. We are again speeding up progress on every front. Here are the main points of our programme:  1. EXPANSION IN HOUSE-BUILDING  Since 1951 homes have been built at an average rate of 300,000 a year. We shall build about 370,000 this year. Next year we shall reach our new target of 400,000. This will be sustained, and will enable us to overtake remaining shortages, while keeping pace with the needs of a more prosperous, younger marrying, longer living and fast increasing population.  2. SLUM CLEARANCE AND URBAN RENEWAL  In the towns and cities where most remaining slums are concentrated, clearance rates are being doubled. We aim to clear by 1973 virtually all the known slums. As each authority completes this task, we shall go on to redevelop out-dated residential areas.  3. MODERNISING OLDER HOUSES  Already 130,000 sound older houses are being modernised each year. The 1964 Housing Act provides for systematic improvement in older areas, with powers of compulsion where landlords are not persuaded to co-operate by the better grant arrangements. In this way we shall step up modernisation to 200,000 a year.  4. INCREASING HOME OWNERSHIP  Owner-occupation has spread to 44 per cent. of families. Conservatives will encourage its continued increase. Land registration leads to reduction of legal fees involved in house purchase: we shall hasten this process, aiming to complete it first in built-up areas and then for the whole country.  5. CO-OWNERSHIP AND COST RENTING  Co-ownership schemes provide most of the advantages of owner-occupation for a much smaller deposit and lower out-goings. We have set up a Housing Corporation which will release £300m. to housing societies, building for co-ownership and for renting without subsidy and without profit.  6. LOCAL AUTHORITY HOUSING  We intend to revise the system of housing subsidies. Provided authorities charge proper rents, with rebates for those who cannot afford them, they will be able to plan ahead confidently and maintain necessary programmes especially for slum clearance, relief of overcrowding new and expanded towns, and the needs of the elderly - without burdening the rates.  7. IMPROVED BUILDING METHODS  Our long-term plans give the construction industries confidence to expand and modernise. Through the voluntary consortia of local authorities and our National Building Agency they are enabled to introduce up-to-date methods and techniques which save site labour and increase productivity. We shall reform the laws governing building standards and safeguard the quality of houses for owner-occupation.  8. SUPPLY OF LAND  Our regional studies, showing land needs for twenty years ahead, will enable planning authorities to release ample land in the right places and without damage to the green belts. This substantial increase in the supply of land will do more to stabilise land prices than anything else.  Where major developments are in prospect-such as the many new towns and town expansions which are being started or proposed land will be acquired well in advance and made available to private and public enterprise as necessary.  The Finance Act 1962 brought short-term land transactions within the sphere of ordinary taxation. In considering any further measure to tax land transactions, the test must be that it should not adversely affect the price or the supply of land.  We reject the Labour Party's"" Land Commission"" as an unworkable and bureaucratic device, which would dry up the voluntary supply of land and slow down all our housing and building programmes.  9. RENT CONTROL  In the next Parliament we shall take no further steps to remove rent control. Additional safeguards for tenants will be provided if shown to be necessary by the inquiry into rented housing in London.  A HEALTHY NATION  The past thirteen years have seen improvements in the nation's health greater than in any comparable period. These advances we owe to medical science and the skill of the healing professions. They could only have been achieved against a background of rising living standards and continuously expanding health services such as Conservative Government is providing.  The Conservative Hospital Plan will ensure that every man, woman and child in the country has access to the best treatment. We aim to build or rebuild some 300 hospitals of which over 80 are already in progress-and carry through 400 major schemes of improvement. Priority will be given to additional maternity beds, so that every mother who needs to will be able to have her baby in hospital. There will be no question of closing any existing hospital unless or until there is satisfactory alternative provision.  Those not needing hospital care will be properly looked after by community services. Local authorities are expanding these under our health and welfare plan. Support for old people living at home will come from increasing numbers of health visitors, home nurses, home helps and social workers for those who can no longer manage on their own, there w ill be modern, specially designed accommodation. Provision for the physically and mentally handicapped is being brought up to date and will be greatly increased. New maternity and child welfare clinics are being built throughout the country.  In these plans for the nation's health, the scope for voluntary service will be emphasised, and we shall concentrate on the human approach which can make all the difference when a person is sick, handicapped or lonely.  CURE AND PREVENTION  A working party is now considering how best we can help the crucial work of the family doctor. Terms and conditions of service, methods of payment, the number of patients on doctors lists, and their access to hospitals and other facilities will be reviewed, so as to raise still further the standards of good doctoring.  We shall improve and bring up to date the law controlling the safety and quality of drugs.  We shall also continue our campaigns against the enemies of good health, by eliminating slum environments, reducing air pollution, and cleaning the rivers and beaches.  THE QUALITY OF LIFE  There is an enormous growth in the variety and richness of leisure-time activity. Appreciation of the arts, hobbies and handicrafts of every kind, physical sports, home and foreign travel-these and other pursuits are increasing year by year. They are a cheerful measure of rising prosperity. For the ""affluence"" at which Socialists sneer is enabling people, not only to satisfy material wants, but to develop their interests and their feel for the quality of life.  The Government has trebled since 1951 the amount of money provided for the arts. Recently we have helped to bring the National Theatre into being, multiplied several times over the grants to museums and galleries for purchasing works of art, and done much to preserve and open to the public old and lovely houses. We shall continue to expand this support and to increase the resources of the Arts Council We shall also seek to promote higher standards of architecture and civic planning, and commission works by contemporary artists for public buildings.  BROADCASTING AND TELEVISION  Broadcasting in Britain has always been regarded as a medium for providing information, education and entertainment. For all these elements to find effective expression, viewers and listeners must be given the widest possible choice of programmes. This is why we introduced I.T.V., authorised BBC-2, and have licensed experiments in Pay-as-you-view television by wire.  We wish to extend the range of choice still further. That will be our object when considering proposals for the fourth television channel and for the establishment of a system of local sound radio.  SPORT  Capital outlay for sport and physical recreation has increased fourfold in four years. But there remains a need in and around the towns and cities for many more sports grounds, playing fields, running tracks, swimming baths and gymnasia. Local authorities have been advised on how to combine with their neighbours for the larger projects, and a substantial programme will be authorised.  COUNTRYSIDE COMMISSION  In the countryside we must satisfy the need for recreational facilities without harm to rural and farming interests.  We propose to set up a countryside commission with sufficient resources to secure the positive care of countryside and coast, including the national parks. It will be charged with promoting the systematic clearance in these localities of derelict land and other eyesores. Whilst strictly safeguarding secluded areas, the commission will advise planning authorities on the designation of recreation areas"" where boating, climbing, gliding and similar activities will be welcome.  FREEDOM AND ORDER  The consistent aim of Conservative policy is to uphold the British way of life, centred upon the dignity and liberty of the individual.  To this end we swept away Socialist restrictions and restored freedom of enterprise and choice. We safeguarded individual rights at tribunals and inquiries along the lines suggested by the Franks Report. We have made reforms in the composition of the House of Lords, the procedure of the House of Commons, and the structure of local government. We have taken measures to protect the public against lawlessness and introduced compensation for the victims of violent crime.  We intend to continue this work of modernising our institutions and strengthening the rule of law.  We shall propose to the newly elected House of Commons the immediate establishment of a select committee to consider further reforms in parliamentary procedure. It will be asked as matters of priority to review the methods for scrutinising public expenditure and to consider ways of speeding up the passage of many technical and relatively uncontroversial law reform Bills which we intend to bring forward. It will also have the opportunity to consider whether adequate means are available to members of Parliament to secure the redress of genuine complaints of maladministration.  A Conservative Government will call an all-party conference presided over by the Speaker to review electoral law. Among the changes it should consider is an extension of postal voting, since two-thirds of the nation now take holidays away from home.  In completing the reorganisation of local government, we shall aim to produce a system giving full scope to local knowledge, and capable of discharging within our regional plans the increasing responsibilities inseparable from rising population, living standards and car ownership.  We have appointed a committee to advise us on the best methods to stimulate and finance social studies both basic and applied, and we shall take action as soon as it reports.  UPHOLDING LAW  We shall continue to build up the strength of the police forces, and see that they are equipped with every modern scientific aid. A royal commission has been set up to report on sentencing policies and the most effective methods for the treatment of offenders. We have asked it to give urgent priority to the growing problem of crime among the young. Meanwhile, we have increased the penalties for malicious damage and the compensation to those who suffer from this form of hooliganism.  The system of after-care will be developed on comprehensive lines, to save offenders from returning to crime.  Much juvenile delinquency originates in broken or unhappy homes. We shall continue to support the work of marriage guidance. Local authorities will be encouraged, in co-operation with voluntary bodies, to develop their services of child care for young people deprived of normal home life and affection.  We shall extend legal aid to all care and protection cases in juvenile courts and, as resources permit, to tribunal cases beginning with the Lands Tribunal.  THE NATION'S CHOICE  We are issuing, simultaneously with this manifesto, special statements recording our achievements and plans in Scotland and in Wales. These demonstrate our regard for the distinctive rights and problems of each nation. They also show how our programmes are designed to secure the even spread of prosperity throughout Great Britain.  A Conservative and Unionist Government will continue to support the Government of Northern Ireland in developing and diversifying the economy, and so providing new employment. It is a cardinal principle of our policy that Northern Ireland's partnership with Great Britain in the United Kingdom shall remain unchanged so long as that is the wish of the Parliament at Stormont.  We have now shown the extent to which, by building upon past progress, fresh advances can be made with a Conservative Government in the next five years.  But we warn the nation that both the gains of the past and the hopes of the future would be imperilled by Socialism.  On examination, what the Labour Parry have to offer is not a ""New Britain"", but a camouflaged return to the dreary doctrines which had already proved a failure when they were last dismissed from office.  What we are offering is an extension of that prosperity - prosperity with a purpose - which our policies have been proved to achieve."

The War on Want  Preface  TIME FOR DECISION  The time has come when the Government must ask the British people to renew and strengthen its mandate. Since we came to power in October, 1964, the nation has had firm government. But without an effective working majority it is difficult - and would become increasingly so - for the Government to continue to exercise influence in the outside world, and to exert its full authority in Whitehall, Westminster and the councils of industry.  Since the collapse of the Macmillan Government three years ago, the authority of successive governments had been eroded by an atmosphere of fevered electoral uncertainty.  THE REMEDY LIES IN THE HANDS OF THE ELECTORS. THE TIME FOR DECISION HAS COME.  The course the Government recommends to the nation is clear. We are asking for a mandate to carry through the radical reconstruction of our national life which we began eighteen months ago. The road of renewal had been mapped in our election manifesto of 1964. Since we took office we have started on the long process of modernising obsolete procedures and institutions, ending the dominance of vested interests, liberating the forces of youth and building a New Britain.  The task we have started, however, cannot be completed by Government acting alone. Its fulfilment will only be possible if the British people understand what the Government is doing, and give us their active support in finishing the job. It is for this active support, represented by a clear Parliamentary majority, that we now ask.  Part 1: Facing the Facts  During the past 18 months, Britain has faced, fought and overcome its toughest crisis since the War. More, it has in the teeth of adversity fashioned the new instruments of policy with which, under the guidance of the National Plan, a new and better Britain can be built.  In this Statement we first make a progress report to the nation. Then we show what next must be done to turn the breathing space won in 1965 into a period of permanent strength and security.  Whatever the future may bring, there can be no turning back to the tired and discredited policies of the long Conservative era. The period of drift and indecision in Government, of backward looking complacency in industry and commerce, of reliance upon individual and group selfishness as the main motive for change - all this is over.  1. BRITAIN IN CRISIS  No one can deny the magnitude of the crisis the Labour Government inherited in 1964.  With a record - and almost incredible - deficit of over £750 million already incurred; with a rising flood of foreign goods; with the pound sterling imperilled; with prices soaring; with wages and salaries following hard behind - the nation in October, 1964, was plunging towards economic disaster and financial collapse.  Not only did the Tories fail to take preventive measures; throughout the previous year they were busily feeding the pre-Election boom. By Initiating a spate of vote-catching schemes, they had encouraged a massive expansion of private and public expenditure without regard for the consequences that would follow after the Election.  But acute as they were, the dangers we faced in October, 1964, were only symptoms of a more fundamental crisis:  1. Successive Tory Governments had failed to rethink Britain's role in the modem world. They failed to identify the new problems of the Sixties and realistically appraise national resources. Instead they pursued, from motives of prestige and nostalgia, foreign, military and financial policies which were increasingly irrelevant and increasingly expensive - policies which sapped our economic strength, depleted our reserves and overstrained our resources.  2. At home there was an equally disastrous failure to tackle the fundamental problems of the British economy: instead of ensuring steady economic growth, a strong balance of payments, the rapid modernisation of our industries and a proper balance between public and private expenditure, the economy was left to the push and pull of the market - as though we were still living in an era of laissez faire.  Consequently, for more than a decade, we suffered the disastrous cycle of Stop-Go; inadequate investment in manufacturing industry; the scandalous neglect of such essential community services as houses, schools and hospitals.  3. Throughout our national life there was a stubborn refusal to root out obsolete ideas and modernise obsolescent institutions. Instead of setting an example to the timid and old-fashioned in industry and commerce, Tory Governments funked the radical reorganisation of the whole machinery of the state - local as well as national - which was so desperately required.  4. Finally - and perhaps most serious - easy-going drift, backward-looking incompetence and an acceptance of national decline were accompanied by the erosion of fairness and social justice, by a growing neglect of community responsibility for the old, the sick and the needy - and by an incitement to speculation and the pursuit of sectional advantage.  2. FORWARD FROM CRISIS  The Labour Government had to take unpopular decisions - and took them regardless of temporary unpopularity. Imports were cut and taxes raised. The TSR2 and other prestige projects were cancelled; firm limits were placed on military and civil expenditure. BUT IN THE PURSUIT OF SOLVENCY AND THE DEFENCE OF THE POUND, WHICH WERE OUR OVERRIDING AIMS, THE NEW GOVERNMENT WAS DETERMINED NOT TO REPEAT CONSERVATIVE STOP-GO.  Whatever the pressures, it would not jettison the four central objectives of its policy:  1. To ensure that even in times of economic crisis those in need should be helped by the state. Even in the first crucial six months of office, retirement and widows' pensions, sickness and unemployment benefits, war and industrial disability pensions were all increased by the greatest amount ever. Prescription charges were abolished and an interim measure was rushed through to stop evictions, unleashed by the Tory Rent Act.  2. To establish a clear system of priorities in public expenditure. While inflated public expenditure generally was cut back, housing, schools and hospitals were specially exempted, as were the regions of high unemployment.  3. To maintain full employment and a high level of investment in productive industry, while damping down the overheated economy.  4. To get on with the longer term reconstruction of Britain, with a National Plan and a range of new economic, fiscal and social policies to carry it through.  Inevitably it took time to forge the new instruments of policy, such as control over building and the movement of capital abroad, without which national planning is an empty phrase.  Nevertheless, the achievement in 500 days has been immense. The deficit on our overseas payments has been cut from over £750 million to around £350 million. Overseas confidence in sterling has grown steadily as the world has become convinced that we are winning the battle for solvency.  The victory was a real one; but so was the price the nation paid. In particular the high interest rates required to strengthen sterling forced up mortgage payments and council house rents. But one price the nation did not have to pay - the deliberate creation of unemployment which our predecessors regarded as inevitable. In this crisis year we raised the level of employment; we built a record number of houses; we achieved record figures for investment in new schools and hospitals. Most important to the future, the deficit was halved; exports rose sharply and industrial investment reached an all-time high.  In the past, our predecessors had reacted to overseas deficits by imposing a total Stop. FACED WITH THE FAR GREATER CRISIS THEY LEFT US IN 1964/65, WE STOPPED THE INESSENTIAL, WE POSTPONED THE LESS ESSENTIAL AND WE WENT RIGHT AHEAD WITH OUR PRIORITIES.  3. TELLING THE PEOPLE  Britain has weathered the storm. But full solvency has yet to be achieved. The debts incurred as a direct consequence of Tory policy will have to be repaid. The reshaping of British industry and the economy have only just begun.  There is no easy road ahead - and only the dishonest would pretend that there is. But we do not believe that the British people want to be lulled with the message that ""all is well"" and that they have ""never had it so good."" Nor do we think that they expected or wanted their Government to present a give-away Budget on the eve of a General Election. We have not done so. And we shall take whatever further steps are necessary even if they are unpopular, in order to achieve the rate of progress that we need.  We are facing the facts - as they should have been faced in the 13 years of Tory rule.  Part 2: A Strong Economy  During the next five years we intend to carry through a massive programme for modernising and strengthening British industry. That is the prime purpose of the National Plan.  We have regulated demand through selective measures with no return to Stop-Go. Now that our new techniques - such as investment grants, licensing of inessential building and the Industrial Re-organisation Corporation - are coming into use, we shall increasingly be able to apply social priorities, giving preference to industrial investment and to a better regional balance.  While implementation of the policy depends on the initiative and ingenuity of industry and commerce, the Government too has its responsibilities abroad as well as at home:  1. PAYING OUR WAY  It is our aim to achieve balance in our international payments by the end of this year. To do this, a persistent national effort will be required.  1. EXPORTS. Last year, exports rose by 5 per cent in volume, and by 7 per cent IN value. Further progress will be made as the new incentives to exporters - the export rebate scheme, better credit facilities and the favourable interest rates - take effect.  2. IMPORTS. The disastrous increase in imports was checked by the temporary surcharge we imposed in 1964. Intense efforts are now being made to replace those imported products which British industry can produce competitively.  3. OVERSEAS MILITARY EXPENDITURE. This is being cut back by such measures as the Anglo-German agreement on B.A.O.R. support costs and the decision to withdraw from Aden and to reduce establishments in Cyprus and Malta. But we shall still be carrying a heavy burden in maintaining commitments abroad as our contribution to peace-keeping in different areas of the world. The 1966 Defence Review is only the first step in a phased programme which should bring substantial cuts both in commitments and in expenditure by 1969-70.  4. DRAIN OF CAPITAL. The uncontrolled flow of British capital abroad has been an excessive burden on an already weak balance of payments. By amending the taxation of overseas income and by selective control over the export of capital, we have staunched this loss of resources.  There can be no relaxing here at least until we again earn a current surplus.  2. INCREASING PRODUCTIVITY  The National Plan, published last September, defined the objectives of the British economy between now and 1970 and then outlined the strategy required to achieve them. Our central aim must be to accelerate industrial expansion without undermining our social priorities.  I. SELECTIVE INVESTMENT  British industry's most compelling need is not just MORE investment but MORE SELECTIVE investment. The National Plan in itself helps by giving industrialists a clear picture of national priorities. We are now introducing three new economic weapons to further this policy:  FIRST, the effect of the Corporation Tax will be to reduce taxation of profits, provided they are ploughed back, not distributed as dividends.  SECOND, the new system of investment incentives will provide direct cash grants to expanding firms. These will differentiate sharply in favour of manufacturing industries, upon which the competitive strength of the economy depends.  THIRD, the Industrial Reorganisation Corporation will stimulate rationalisation, modernisation and expansion in those fields where British industry at present seems unable to compete with the giant firms of the U.S. and Europe.  II. PRODUCTIVITY, PRICES AND INCOMES  In order to safeguard the real value of wages, the Labour Government launched the first serious attack on the rising cost of living. The weapon specially fashioned for this attack is the policy for productivity, prices and incomes, which forms an essential part of the National Plan. Without such a policy it is impossible either to keep exports competitive or to check rising prices at home. The alternative, in fact, is a return to the dreary cycle of inflation followed by deflation and unemployment.  Substantial progress has been made in working out, with management and the unions, the objectives and criteria of such a policy. An essential part of the machinery, the Prices and Incomes Board, is now operating. But the policy needs further development.  FIRST, we intend to give a new stress to productivity, and we will attack restrictive practices wherever they exist. A National Conference representative of industry will be called under the Chairmanship of the Prime Minister to discuss all matters relating to productivity, including the extension throughout industry of Pay and Productivity Councils, representing management and employees. This will form part of an effort to stimulate industrial democracy.  SECOND, we shall reconstitute the Prices and Incomes Board and seek such developments in the early warning system as are necessary for the Board to do its job properly. Our purpose is not to dictate prices, wages and salaries - but to give, in selected cases, the opportunity for objective consideration of claims before either prices are fixed or collective bargains struck.  THIRD, we shall make sure that the policy is not only fair but seen to be fair. In our pursuit of a planned growth of incomes the needs of the lower-paid worker will not be ignored.  III. REGIONAL ECONOMIC PLANNING  Effective Regional Planning is needed:  - (a) to assist the areas of chronic unemployment, and so bring into production the remaining untapped sources of labour; and  - (b) to stop the drift of work and population to the West Midlands and the South East where congestion adds enormously to business and social costs.  Vigorous action has already been taken in this field. We have used our new office and building controls to relieve congestion in London and Birmingham. We have extended the development areas and guided industry there. We have helped firms ready to set up business in development regions through massive special investment grants. We have further discriminated in favour of these areas by totally exempting them from the cuts imposed last summer on national and local government expenditure.  Industrial Development Certificates are helping to bring new building to the under-employed regions - and reducing it in the congested South East. As a result, employment has grown markedly in these regions.  These, however, are only the first emergency steps towards the development of full-scale regional economic planning, for which the Regional Councils and the Regional Boards have been established.  SCOTLAND AND WALES  Labour respects the differences of culture and tradition of Scotland and Wales; nevertheless, we see the economic well-being of Great Britain as indivisible. The Government has therefore set out measures which help both Scotland and Wales, within the context of a true National Plan.  New life has been brought to the Highlands and Islands, and a major Plan prepared for economic and social expansion in Scotland. The task now is to achieve its targets, and keep up the record progress made in 1965.  For the first time there is a Secretary of State for Wales in the Cabinet. The Welsh office is already making an impact on employment, industrial development and opportunities for young people in Wales. The Welsh Economic Development Council is now working out genuinely Welsh solutions to the problems of the rural areas.  3. HELPING INDUSTRY  Some of our industries present special problems, too serious to be over come from their own resources. In such cases the Government must be ready to help. To this end, we propose, apart from vigorous action by the Industrial Reorganisation Corporation:  - to continue and develop policies introduced by the new Ministry of Technology for providing purposive financial assistance to key industries such as computers and machine tools.  - to use the various publicly financed research councils and the enlarged N.R.D.C. to sponsor and develop new science-based industries.  - to transfer the private steel monopoly into public ownership and to rationalise its structure.  - to rationalise the aircraft industry on the basis of public participation, taking into account the recent Plowden Report.  PRIVATE AND PUBLIC ENTERPRISE  Britain has a mixed economy - and both sectors must play their part in carrying out the National Plan. Both sectors, however, must be encouraged to become more enterprising.  In the PRIVATE SECTOR, we have already proposed major reforms of Company Law, the purpose of which will be to stimulate, through much greater disclosure of their affairs, improved managerial practices and a better use of their resources. Companies will also be required to publish details of their political subscriptions.  We shall encourage go-ahead firms by changes in the tax laws and, by securing a larger say in the affairs of companies for full-time working directors, encourage technical expertise, knowledge and Initiative.  In the PUBLIC SECTOR, we shall remove statutory restrictions from publicly owned industries and so encourage greater diversification of their activities. In a rapidly changing economy it is simply absurd to limit by statute these large enterprises to a single sphere of activity.  The great fuel and power industries occupy a major part of the public sector. Here, the Government has laid the basis for a national fuel policy, and gone a long way towards reconstruction of the coal industry's finances by writing off £415 million of the National Coal Board's capital debt. Further financial measures will help concentrate production on the most economic pits, and provide up to £30 million to encourage labour mobility.  The best available estimate of the market for coal in 1970 is 170-180 million tons. We stress that this is an estimate, and in no sense a limitation. Everything depends upon efficiency, costs and the resulting prices. If more can be profitably sold, then no barrier will stand in the way of expansion.  We shall further develop co-operation between nationalised industries to cut out waste; we shall set out more precise targets to guide their investment and price policy in the national interest.  4. AGRICULTURE  The selective expansion of agricultural production is a key part of the National Plan. In particular, it will make a significant contribution to the balance of payments by import saving.  THE RECORD OF OUR FARMERS AND FARM WORKERS IN INCREASING PRODUCTIVITY IS OUTSTANDING. WE SHALL NOT SHAKE THEIR CONFIDENCE BY SUBSTITUTING FOR THE WELL-TRIED DEFICIENCY PAYMENTS THE LEVIES ON IMPORTED FOODSTUFFS ADVOCATED BY THE CONSERVATIVES. THIS WOULD REDUCE THE FARMERS' SECURITY AND PUSH UP FOOD PRICES TO NEW HIGH LEVELS.  The cost to the Exchequer of agricultural support can much better be contained by measures designed to enable the industry to achieve STILL higher productivity and a higher return on its capital. To this end we have presented a scheme to promote agricultural and horticultural co-operation and develop the resources of the hills and uplands.  WE SHALL CONTINUE TO IMPROVE THE CONDITIONS OF THE FARM WORKER, AND SEE THAT HE GETS HIS FULL SHARE OF RISING PROSPERITY.  We shall also expand agricultural research, making the results more widely available. Most important of all, we shall Initiate the radical reform required to achieve cheaper marketing of foodstuffs by reducing the gap between what the producer receives and what the consumer pays.  To maintain price stability and orderly marketing, imports of foodstuffs must be integrated with home supplies. Since these imports form so high a proportion of all our imports, and have a profound effect on our balance of payments, our price levels and the stability of our home industry, the Government must retain responsibility for integration.  We shall do our utmost to conclude international commodity arrangements with a view to promoting stability. As the circumstances of each commodity differ, each will have to be treated on its merits.  5. THE STANDARD OF LIVING  In the next five years living standards for the individual and for the whole community will rise by 25 per cent, as we increase our production of goods and services.  However, unless we can check the rising cost of living many groups, particularly those on fixed incomes, will find their living standards undermined - as they were persistently under the Tories. The prices and incomes policy is our main response to this problem. But other policies are also relevant. Labour's rent control, for example, has secured hundreds of thousands of tenants against rising rents.  In particular, we shall further reduce inflated costs and profit margins in production and distribution by waging a vigorous anti-monopoly policy in fields where market powers are abused. We have already referred a number of cases to the strengthened Monopolies Commission.  We shall also enforce quality standards and protect the consumer from sharp trading practices. Under Labour's Protection of Consumer Bill, false advertising, misleading labelling of goods, deceptive prices (the ""4d.-off racket"") and oral mis-statements by doorstep salesmen, are banned.  This ""Shoppers' Charter"" will be administered by Local Authorities, whose Weights and Measures Officers will be able quickly to deal with customers' complaints of unfair trading.  Part 3: Building a New Britain  The Britain we want has yet to be built. Many of our cities and towns are bursting at the seams with growing populations. Those spawned by the industrial revolution grew without vision or plan. They are utterly inadequate to the needs of today. But whether planned or unplanned, all our towns are choked with traffic, and their population overspill threatens the unspoiled countryside around.  Within them, essential services are in short supply and in urgent need of renewal. Not only houses and roads, but hospitals, schools, universities, offices, civic buildings, facilities for leisure and recreation - even water and sewerage - are strained to breaking point.  At the same time our network of communications - passenger and freight, road, rail and canal, ports and airfields - is increasingly inadequate and chaotic.  In their pre-election boom the Conservatives gave the impression that money, resources and skilled labour were available to meet any and all of these demands simultaneously. It is now plain that the grandiose plans they announced were uncosted and mutually inconsistent. The industries concerned - building and civil engineering - cannot expand without limit when other demands of the economy are taken into account. Although their efficiency is being improved and their output increased, demands will outstrip resources for years ahead and there will be a constant shortage of skilled labour.  Moreover, the resources available are strictly limited. That is why, in this crucial field of physical reconstruction, priorities must be clearly defined and strongly enforced.  1. HOUSING  Our first priority is houses. Last year, for the first time in a period of general economic restraint, the housing programme not only did not suffer but actually expanded.  - In 1963, the nation built 300,000 houses.  - In 1964, as part of the Tory pre-election boom, the figure reached 374,000 - and greatly strained the building supply industry.  - In 1965, we not only overcame the shortages but increased the total to 383,000 houses.  In the next five years we shall go further. We have announced - and we intend to achieve - a Government target of 500,000 houses by 1969/70. After that we shall go on to higher levels still. It can be done - as other nations have shown. It must be done - for bad and inadequate housing is the greatest social evil in Britain today.  I. CONTROLS  To achieve our target, we need powers to stop less essential building. Office building is now controlled by law, and a strict control of all local authority building is exercised by the Ministers concerned. In this way resources and labour are being made available for the increased housing programme.  II. LAND  We inherited a land famine and rocketing prices, caused by the Tory decision to return to a free market in land. In the Crown Land Commission we are fashioning an instrument to secure a sufficiently orderly supply of land, and bring back to the community a substantial part of the development value created. This has met bitter opposition from Liberals as well as Conservatives.  III. HOUSES TO LET  The desperate shortage of houses to let at moderate rents in our great conurbations can only be met by a large and speedy increase in council building. To make this financially possible, we have provided councils with the equivalent of 4 per cent interest rates for house building. At present interest rates, the new Subsidy Bill increases the basic subsidy of £24, where the Tories left it, to well over £60 per house. Part of this very substantial increase will be used by councils to ensure that every new house is built to the improved standards laid down by the Government.  In order to combine labour saving and standardisation, which will cut costs, with the improved quality on which we must insist, we are requiring local authorities to rely increasingly on modern system building techniques.  IV. HOUSES TO BUY  In order to secure an adequate flow of finance for private housing we have persuaded the building societies and the builders to work closely with the Ministry of Housing in planning a steady continuous expansion of output up to their share of the programme.  In addition to a mortgage plan (see page 17) we are determined to protect the owner-occupier against the jerry-builder. This can best be achieved if the building societies and the builders agree that mortgages will only be given on houses covered by the National House Building Registration Council certificate. The Government has made it clear, however, that if this voluntary scheme is not working effectively by the end of the year, legislation will be used.  2. CITIES AND TOWNS  Britain needs a massive programme of urban renewal. Large parts of our cities are in decay and many of our urban centres are ill-designed and choked with motor traffic.  Here, however, we need the most careful planning if resources are not to be wasted. In the past ten years, far too many ill-thought-out plans have been sanctioned, tearing out at great cost urban centres and renewing them for essentially commercial purposes. Department stores and office blocks have made far too heavy demands on the construction industries. A new strategy of development is required.  - FIRST, AND MOST IMPORTANT, WE MUST DEAL WITH THE PROBLEM OF THE JOURNEY TO WORK: for it is this, particularly in London and the other great cities, that poses the most intractable problem, presenting our diminishing public transport fleets with a tidal wave of users and jamming the roads with private car commuters. We are convinced that the basic solution to this problem must lie with improved public transport, supported by sensible parking regulations and by road building designed to siphon off through-traffic. We are already reviewing the absurd closure programme of suburban and urban rail services. We shall maintain public transport services in our towns and cities and aim at higher levels of comfort and frequency. We shall also tackle the problems of central redevelopment and new forms of transport by financing feasibility studies by local authorities; e.g., a monorail for Manchester.  - SECOND: WE SHALL MAKE A NEW APPROACH TO THE PROBLEM OF CENTRAL AREAS IN OUR CITIES. Slum clearance must of course go on. But there must be quicker and fairer compensation for those displaced. However, we shall not be content simply to demolish. Wherever possible, we shall renew and modernise existing buildings. We shall also ensure that expensive facilities such as swimming pools, playing fields, assembly halls, are made more widely available to the community and not reserved only for the particular groups - schools and colleges - for which they were built. The better provision of sporting, arts and other leisure facilities is essential to modern living.  - THIRD: WE SHALL GO AHEAD WITH A FURTHER PROGRAMME OF NEW AND EXPANDED TOWNS. It was one of the scandals of the wasted years that from 1951 to 1961 not one New Town was authorised in Britain. We are now at work on a second generation of much bigger towns to relieve the strain on London, Birmingham, Liverpool and Manchester. They will reduce urban pressure by recruiting their citizens mainly from the housing lists and from council houses. Wherever possible we are also expanding the established New Towns. We shall fulfil our promise to bring real democratic self-government to those which are fully grown, by the abolition of the New Towns Commission.  3. TRANSPORT  Transport planning, both national and regional, is an essential part of community planning. The Tory attempt to solve our transport problems by increasing competition between road and rail, by the adoption of rigid commercial criteria for the railways and other public transport services, and by deliberate fragmentation of transport undertakings, is the most conspicuous and most costly of all their failures.  Restoring sense and balance to our transport system is now an immensely difficult job. But it must be undertaken.  Within the framework of a NATIONAL TRANSPORT PLAN Labour will:  1. Carry out an expanding road programme speeding up road construction and cutting costs by new methods of financing highway development.  2. Co-ordinate road and rail in order to use existing resources to best effect. As a first step, we shall create a National Freight Authority to co-ordinate the movement of freight by road and rail, and provide a first-rate publicly owned service.  3. Legislate to annul the evil effects of the 1962 Tory Transport Act.  4. Encourage the formation of regional and area transport authorities, to provide more effective public transport in both the conurbations and rural areas, by integrating road, rail and other forms of transport.  5. In order to speed up the vital flow of exports, reorganise and modernise the nation's ports on the basis of a strong National Ports Authority and publicly owned Regional Port Authorities. Within the ports, we shall end inefficiencies and delays in cargo handling and help to cure the chaos of the casual system by making each Port Authority ultimately responsible for all Port operations within its area, including stevedoring, and by extending the present valuable experience of joint participation.  6. Remove the statutory restriction on the manufacturing powers of the publicly owned transport industries.  To safeguard road users, Labour will press ahead with legislation to restrict drink while driving, to introduce more frequent testing of heavy goods vehicles and to provide for special driving tests and licences for their drivers.  4. THE COUNTRYSIDE  Commons, parks, lakes and coastal areas are of the utmost importance for recreation and leisure. They must not be spoilt by private development, and public access must be assured.  The Government has already taken vigorous steps to preserve our coast line, and safeguard common land.  A new and more powerful Commission to deal with the whole countryside and coastline is now proposed. Its first aim will be the creation of country parks, to provide suitable sites for picnics, for leisure pastimes, and for the motorist.  Long distance walks, access to the open country, the provision of recreation on canals and rivers - all will form part of this new, imaginative policy from which millions of our people will benefit, and by which the important balance between town and country will be maintained.  We shall strengthen the Forestry Commission; promote landscape planting of trees; thoroughiy explore the nation's mineral resources. We shall ensure adequate water supplies by all means, including - where necessary - extensions of public ownership.  Part 4: The Family in the New Welfare State  At its simplest, our aim is to extend to the whole community what the responsible citizen wishes for himself and his family:  - FIRST and foremost, the opportunity to work and to be fairly rewarded for it.  - SECOND, to make provision against the day when age, sickness, injury or redundancy impairs his capacity to earn.  - THIRD, to know that during the misfortunes of ill health, the facilities of a modern and well equipped service will be available.  - FOURTH, for his children to receive the best possible standard of education and training, developing their abilities to the full.  - FIFTH, to have a home for his family, and to be able to buy or rent it at reasonable terms.  - SIXTH, to make a just and reasonable contribution to the costs of the essential community services which he demands.  1. FULL EMPLOYMENT POLICIES  The level of economic activity in the community must be sufficient to provide jobs for all Labour has always insisted that this can and will be ensured through intelligent management of the economy.  The problem today and in the future is not the general unemployment of the inter-war years but the redundancy that is due both to decline in demand for the products of an industry and to the development of new labour-saving methods of production.  Coal, cotton, agriculture and the railways are among those industries in which, in the postwar years, employment has sharply contracted. Unlike our predecessors, we have positive policies to meet this problem. We shall:  1. Ensure that NEW INDUSTRIES, providing new jobs, are available as and when older industries decline. That is the essential aim of our location of industry policy.  2. MODERNISE TRAINING AND EXTEND RETRAINING, so that new skills are rapidly acquired. The Government's decision to make day-release a necessary condition for the new training grants is a major breakthrough in this field.  3. EASE THE TRANSITION from one job to another. This is the purpose of our Redundancy Payments Act, which brings lump sum compensation, related to service, to those affected by redundancy.  4. Deal with the problem of transferability of OCCUPATIONAL PENSIONS.  5. Recognise the right to TRADE UNION REPRESENTATION and ensure proper safeguards against arbitrary dismissal.  6. SUPPLEMENT voluntary collective bargaining by substantially increasing the voluntary industrial arbitration and conciliation machinery, including such successful innovations as the 'on the spot"" investigations instituted by the Labour Government in the motor industry.  Finally, we must move towards greater fairness in the rewards for work. That is why we stand for equal pay for equal work and, to this end, have started negotiations.  We cannot be content with a situation in which important groups - particularly women, but male workers, too, in some occupations - continue to be underpaid.  2. RECONSTRUCTING SOCIAL SECURITY  The postwar Labour Government created the National Insurance scheme under which flat-rate pensions and other benefits are paid as of right in return for flat-rate contributions.  But, over the years, this system has become increasingly inadequate, as the widening gap between actual earnings and National Insurance benefits makes it impossible to keep up living standards during absence or retirement from work.  Our plans for a far-reaching reconstruction of social security were well-advanced when we took office. But first we had to undertake the rescue operation which we had promised. Within four weeks the Government introduced legislation to provide the largest single increase in retirement pensions and other social benefits since the National Insurance scheme began. The earnings rule for widows was abolished, and prescription charges removed. With this initial relief provided, we could plan the methods and the phases of radical reconstruction.  1. Legislation has already been enacted which before the end of this year will provide earnings-related supplements during the first six months of sickness, unemployment or widowhood.  2. We shall within the lifetime of the next Parliament prepare and bring forward a genuine earnings-related, contributory pension scheme to replace the present Tory swindle. The new graduated scheme will overcome the problems of transferability of pension rights when an employee changes his job. There will be partnership between state and occupational schemes.  3. We shall establish a Ministry of Social Security uniting the Ministry of Pensions and National Insurance and the National Assistance Board. It will deal with the whole range of social security questions, and ensure a rational single system of paying benefits. The Ministry will also head a drive to seek out, and alleviate, poverty whether among children or old people.  4. Finally, in the interests of greater equity, we shall seek ways of integrating more fully the two quite different systems of social payment - tax allowances and cash benefits paid under National Insurance.  3. HEALTH AND WELFARE SERVICES  - (i) Hospitals. The review we have undertaken of the much publicised Conservative Hospital Plan has confirmed our worst suspicions. The money they allocated was utterly inadequate to carry out the Plan, and to provide the new and modernised hospitals we so urgently need. Our aim will be to increase by 1970 the annual spending on hospital building to a figure double the highest sum spent in any year by the Conservatives. Already we have provided substantially more money for the running of our hospitals, and the rate of development will continue to increase.  - (ii) THE FAMILY DOCTOR SERVICE. In the space of a year, the Labour Government has produced the blueprint of a completely revitalised family doctor service. We shall ensure that all practical steps are taken to enable the hard-pressed family doctor to give the best possible service to his patients with the greatest satisfaction to himself. Many of the problems in general practice stem from the serious shortage of doctors, for which successive Tory Ministers bear a heavy responsibility. We have already made arrangements to increase the number of medical students by well over 10 per cent a year within the next couple of years. This is only a first step: a newly established Royal Commission on Medical Education will help chart future expansion.  - (iii) COMMUNITY SERVICES. Local health and welfare services, especially for the elderly and the mentally handicapped, have been expanding fast. We shall develop these services rapidly, with special emphasis on those designed to help old people to continue living in their own homes. For those who can no longer do so, much more purpose-built accommodation will be provided to replace large obsolete institutions which can offer neither comfort nor a homely atmosphere.  - (iv) PREVENTIVE HEALTH. Far too little attention has been paid to preventive health measures in the past. Screening for cervical cancer, which it is estimated will save the lives of some 2,000 women a year, is being developed rapidly. More preventive health campaigns are planned. We shall make a real forward drive in the neglected field of health education, setting up an entirely new body, the Health Education Council, for this purpose.  4. EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES FOR ALL  Our educational aims are two-fold: to give the highest possible standard of education to all children, and to ensure that those with special abilities have the opportunity to develop them to the full.  These aims have to be achieved against an inheritance of acute teacher shortage, oversized classes, old and inadequate school buildings, and a chronically overstrained system of higher education.  SCHOOLS  Our first priority is to reduce the size of classes. We shall intensify our efforts to increase the recruitment of teachers, and improve their status in society.  We must also make the most effective use of teachers, by encouraging the use of audio-visual aids and programmed learning; and by providing the teacher with the ancillary help which he increasingly needs.  We shall carry out the largest school building programme in our history. The National Plan shows that the programme will be increased from £84 million in the last year of Tory rule to £138 million in 1969/70.  Equally important, we shall press ahead with our plans to abolish the 11-plus - that barrier to educational opportunity - and re-organise secondary education on comprehensive lines. We have appointed the Public Schools Commission, to recommend the best ways of integrating the Public Schools into the State sector.  NEW DEAL FOR THE SCHOOL LEAVER  Far too many of our young people still leave school at 15, enter jobs with no training prospects and break off all contact with education. We plan to transform this situation by the early 1970s.  The school leaving age will be raised to 16. The new Schools Council is studying ways of making this extra year at school the greatest success.  Industrial Training Boards will increase the range of training opportunities for school leavers. They are not just concerned with the traditional craft skills. They will deal with the office, the shop, and the farm as well as the factory; with girls as well as boys.  There will be a big increase of day-release and block release courses at local colleges of further education. It will become normal, rather than exceptional, for young workers to have part-time education up to the age of at least 18.  There will also be radical improvements in the Youth Employment Service, and in careers advice at school, in accordance with the Albemarle Report.  Finally, a new Minister is energetically creating, through regional sports councils, a new approach to the provision of facilities for sport.  HIGHER EDUCATION  We shall expand higher education provision in the universities, the colleges of education, and the leading technical colleges.  The UNIVERSITIES are being assisted to make a growing contribution in science, technology and social studies.  The COLLEGES OF EDUCATION will benefit from our new plans to liberalise their systems of government, giving more academic freedom. We shall encourage the growth of arrangements between the colleges and the universities, to enable more students to take a B.Ed. degree.  In the leading TECHNICAL COLLEGES we shall rationalise the provision of higher courses, so that there can be a very large expansion combined with very high quality.  THE OPEN UNIVERSITY  We shall establish the University of the Air. By using TV and radio communal facilities, high grade correspondence courses and new teaching techniques, this open University will enormously extend the best teaching facilities and give everyone the opportunity of study for a full degree.  It will mean genuine equality of opportunity for millions of people for the first time. Moreover, even for those who prefer not to take a full course, it will bring the widest and best contribution possible to their general level of knowledge and breadth of interests.  ARTS AND AMENITIES  Access for all to the best of Britain's cultural heritage is a wider part of our educational and social purpose, and is one hallmark of a civilised country. That is why we appointed the first Minister for Arts and Leisure.  The 1965 White Paper, ""Policy for the Arts"", has inspired a coherent, generous and imaginative approach to the arts and amenities. Already the situation is being transformed, by substantially increased financial support for the Arts Council, purchasing grants for museums, and five times the support for younger artists. A quite new local authority building fund has been initiated. Next year expenditure on the arts will rise by £2½ million.  5. FAIR RENTS AND MORTGAGES  A secure home for everyone is the most important contribution a community can make to family life. Building houses is only half the job. People need houses at a cost they can afford; and, once in their homes, they need protection against exploitation or eviction.  (i) THE NEW RENT ACT  The 1957 Tory Rent Act inflicted injury on hundreds of thousands of families by decontrolling their homes in a period of intense housing shortage. Labour was pledged to annul this social crime. This we have done. In addition to restoring security of tenure to every decontrolled house, we are appointing rent officers and rent assessment committees for fixing fair rents. The new Act also gives basic protection to almost everyone in his home, including the lodger and the worker in his tied cottage. Today it is a crime not merely to evict without a court order but to harass or to persecute anyone in order to force him out or force his rent up.  (ii) LEASEHOLD ENFRANCHISEMENT  For years socialists have crusaded to redress the grievance of the leaseholder who loses his home without compensation when a long lease comes to an end.  More thin one million house-owners will benefit from the Leasehold Enfranchisement Bill which we shall enact.  (iii) A FAIR DEAL FOR THE COUNCIL HOUSE TENANT  The new houses we are pledged to build will not help existing tenants of council houses. Indeed most of them will have to contribute towards paying for them by increased rents. Within limits this is fair. But in cities crippled with slums, the burden was becoming too great. Hence the Government's decision to give special financial relief to selected authorities so that rent increases can be kept within bounds.  (iv) THE NEW HOME OWNERSHIP PLAN  Those who wish to buy their own homes also need help from the State. Until now this mainly took the form of tax remissions on mortgage instalments. The higher the mortgagee's income bracket and the more expensive his house, the bigger his tax concession. This system is obviously unfair, particularly since the lower paid get nothing at all.  We have therefore announced a new Home Ownership Plan under which each mortgagee will have this choice: to retain his present right to tax concessions - or qualify for a new Government grant which brings down the interest rate on his mortgage by 2j per cent (subject to a minimum of 4 per cent).  With the help of this grant many more wage-earners, especially those with family responsibilities, will be able to buy their own homes. Everyone who joins the Home Ownership Plan will also benefit from a new Government Guarantee which will substantially reduce any deposit he is required to make.  6. FAIR TAXATION  In an age when taxation is bound to be substantial, it is essential that the tax system should be fair and intelligible. This has not been true of Britain for many years. Among the worst injustices has been the heavy weight of taxation on the average citizen and the very light burden which) as a result of tax avoidance and other devices, is borne by those best able to shoulder it.  To remedy this we have already introduced:  1. A CAPITAL GAINS TAX which at last brings into the tax system those large and previously tax-free gains, realised on the sale of shares and securities.  2. A MEASURE TO DEAL WITH BUSINESS EXPENSE ACCOUNTS, by refusing to accept such expenses - except where related to export earnings - as deductions from company or income tax.  3. A CORPORATION TAX which has the effect both of increasing the taxation of company profits if dividends are raised) and of decreasing them where profits are retained.  We now intend to reinforce these remedies with two new measures: a general tax on betting and gaming, and a Land Levy. The case for the first need not be argued. The second will deal with the grossest example of speculative gains - the difference between the value of land at its existing use and the price received when it is sold for redevelopment.  REFORMING THE RATES  The most urgent area for tax reform is the rating system. When our reconstruction of local government has been completed, we shall introduce major reforms in local finance.  Meanwhile the worst features of the rating system are being put right:  1. The new system of RATE REBATES to help the two million hardest hit families should be in operation this year.  2. A new measure of DOMESTIC DE-RATING will relieve all domestic ratepayers of about half the annual increase.  3. EMPTY PROPERTIES, now free from rates, will make a contribution.  Part 5: Wider Democracy in the New Britain  To create the new Britain we require an immense effort by the whole community. That effort can only be effective if the machinery of Government, in all its aspects) is refashioned to meet the needs of a modern society.  In the next five years, it is not the power of Government that we shall seek to extend, but its efficiency and intelligence. The truth is that for many of the tasks that they must perform, our institutions are badly organised and ill-equipped.  In the short time that the Government has been in office) a start has been made in reorganising the structure of Government Departments; in setting up new Commissions to overhaul both the Civil Service and Local Government; in convening a Speaker's Conference to review the electoral system and in the proposal for a Parliamentary Commissioner (or ""Ombudsman"") to investigate complaints by the citizens against the Administration.  Law Commissioners have started to revise, consolidate and modernise our ancient laws, to bring them into line with the needs of a modern society. This is a considerable achievement. But it does not go far enough.  1. REORGANISING WHITEHALL  In the interests of efficiency we shall greatly improve the collection, processing and organisation of Government information and statistical services.  We shall streamline the organisation of many departments - for example, in addition to the new unified Ministry of Social Security, by integrating the Colonial Office in the Commonwealth Relations Office, and bringing into the Ministry of Housing, the Ministry of Land and relevant parts of the Ministry of Public Building and Works.  2. MODERNISING PARLIAMENT  1. Improvement and modernisation of the work of Parliament is essential to reinforce the democratic element in modern Government. Changes must improve procedure and the work of committees, and reform facilities for research and information.  2. Consideration is being given to the broadcasting of Commons proceedings, in order to bring Parliament closer to the people it represents, and to increase the sense of public participation in policy making.  3. The Labour Party has proposed to the Speaker's Conference the introduction of Votes at Eighteen, to add a necessary political dimension to the increasingly important economic and social position of young people.  4. Finally, legislation will be introduced to safeguard measures approved by the House of Commons from frustration by delay or defeat in the House of Lords.  3. IMMIGRATION  In the field of immigration, we shall continue realistic controls, flexibly administered, combined with an imaginative and determined programme to ensure racial equality. Incitement to racial hatred has been outlawed, and financial support given to the positive work of promoting racial harmony. A special committee is now studying the law relating to the position of aliens and Commonwealth immigrants who are refused entry or threatened with deportation.  4. LAW ENFORCEMENT  For years Britain has been confronted by a rising crime rate, overcrowded prisons and many seriously undermanned police forces.  STRENGTHENING THE POLICE  The slide in numbers has already been checked. Energetic action will now  be taken to build up police strength in those areas confronted with a severe shortage. We shall ensure not only that police resources are used more efficiently, but that they receive the most modern scientific and technological equipment.  There is also an urgent need for fewer - and larger - police forces. This cannot await the reports of the Royal Commission on Local Government. We shall, therefore, press ahead with a vigorous programme of amalgamations, to provide the police with the form of organisation best suited to the battle against crime.  Proposals for dealing with adult and juvenile offenders have been set out in two White Papers. Detailed legislative proposals will be presented early in the next Parliament.  The problem of our out-of-date, overcrowded prisons and borstals remains. The parole system for adult offenders will ease the pressure on accommodation to some extent. But our prisons can only provide a useful reformative influence when we close the doors on some of the worst survivals of mid-19th-century England and transfer the inmates to more modern surroundings where they can do work of some social value.  Part 6: The New Britain and the World  While great tasks await us at home, we must never forget that Britain is part of a world community; that it is involved in the affairs of mankind; that in many areas it has special responsibility which it alone must bear; that it has, more widely, a key role to play.  But what should our objectives be?  - Britain must be committed to realism in Defence;  - Britain must work to strengthen the United Nations which is the main instrument for peace in a divided world;  - Britain must promote nuclear disarmament and work to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons;  - Britain must work to achieve better relations in Europe;  - Britain must not fail to contribute to peace-keeping outside Europe;  - Britain must take the lead in the war on want and deprivation.  1. REALISM IN DEFENCE  Britain has a key role to play in promoting peaceful change; but Britain's position has also changed. Although we are a world power with world responsibilities, this is not the 19th century when Britain ruled one-quarter of mankind. We have to see ourselves realistically in the right proportion, not spreading ourselves beyond our means nor failing in our duty.  Britain's security and influence in the world depend no less on the strength of her economy than on her military power. Excessive and mis-directed defence expenditure by Conservative Governments has weakened our economy without providing forces sufficient to carry out the tasks imposed on them without dangerous overstrain. Labour has carried out a comprehensive review of Britain's foreign and defence policies to rectify this situation.  The Defence Review has achieved its three objectives:  - (i) It has brought the runaway growth in our defence expenditure under control, and made sure that we get value for the money we spend.  - (ii) It has decided what military tasks and political commitments it will make sense for Britain to undertake within the limits of her resources.  - (iii) It has made certain that our forces will be able to carry out these tasks, without overstrain, with the full range of weapons needed for the job.  By bringing defence spending down to a stable level of about 6 per cent of our national wealth, Labour will be able to direct new capital and skills to vital industrial modernisation. The country will benefit from this new realism in defence.  2. THE UNITED NATIONS  The United Nations is mankind's chief instrument for preserving the rule of law, promoting peaceful change and fighting poverty. When Labour came to power, the United Nations was rent by dispute. The Labour Government, by contrast to the habitual Conservative disparagement of the United Nations, appointed a Foreign Office Minister to lead Britain's delegation, helped to resolve the dispute, helped the United Nations to pay its debts and strengthened it by a pledge to make forces available for peace keeping activities. It was at the Security Council of the United Nations that Britain explained her policy for ending the Rhodesian rebellion and won world support to make sanctions effective. Labour will continue to give full support to the authority and efficiency of the United Nations.  3. NUCLEAR WEAPONS  Within N.A.T.O. we have given over-riding priority to stopping the further spread of atomic weapons. For this purpose we believe that Labour's proposal for an Atlantic Nuclear Force remains the best basis for allied discussions, since it allows for legitimate consultation among the members of N.A.T.O. while providing firm guarantees against new fingers on the nuclear trigger. Labour stands by its pledge to internationalise our strategic nuclear forces.  With the appointment in the Foreign Office of a Minister for Disarmament, Britain has exercised increasing influence in the Geneva Disarmament Conference. The Government had a difficult task; the Conservatives had landed Britain with the political dangers of an ""independent nuclear deterrent"" without in fact producing a deterrent that was truly independent. Labour's immediate objectives are agreements to stop all nuclear tests and prevent the spread of nuclear weapons; further, Labour will seek agreements to create nuclear-free zones and make possible agreed and verified inter national disarmament.  4. BETTER RELATIONS IN EUROPE  In seeking to relax tensions in Europe we need to keep the confidence of our allies and to reach understanding with the East. We must be both ready to reach agreement and determined to resist threats. Labour, there fore, firmly supports N.A.T.O. and has greatly increased Britain's contact and understanding with the Soviet Union and other countries of Eastern Europe. By the end of this year Labour Ministers will have visited nearly all of those countries. By such contact we shall encourage trade and travel and promote that growth of trust which is essential to progress towards disarmament and assured peace. This progress towards normalisation of our relations with Eastern Europe is an essential part of our whole European policy.  Britain is a member of the European Free Trade Association, which is a thriving organisation beneficial to us and to our partners. The Labour Government has taken the lead in promoting an approach by E.F.T.A. to the countries of the European Economic Community so that Western Europe shall not be sharply divided into two conflicting groups. Labour believes that Britain, in consultation with her E.F.T.A. partners, should be ready to enter the European Economic Community, provided essential British and Commonwealth interests are safeguarded.  The Conservative record on relations between Britain and the ""Six"" is one of notorious and abject failure. Yet Conservatives now talk as if they could take Britain into the Common Market without any conditions or safeguards.  Labour believes that close contact with Europe - joint industrial ventures, scientific co-operation, political and cultural links - can produce among the ""Six"" that understanding of Britain's position which is necessary to a wider European unity.  5. PEACE-KEEPING OUTSIDE EUROPE  But it is the world outside Europe that now presents the greatest challenge and the greatest danger to mankind. The greatest problem in Asia is the future of China; this nation could render immeasurable service to mankind, but at present she is embittered and distrustful of the West and menacing to her neighbours. The Labour Government has worked and will continue to work for the granting to the Chinese Government of her rightful place in the Security Council of the United Nations, believing that there her differences with the rest of the world can best be resolved.  Meanwhile the cruel war in Vietnam continues; Labour has consistently urged negotiations to stop the fighting and a settlement which would enable the peoples of North and South Vietnam to determine their own future and which would ensure that the whole country became neutral, without foreign troops or bases. Labour welcomes the readiness of the United States to negotiate on these lines; we still await an equal readiness from North Vietnam. The Labour Government has, through many channels, urged on North Vietnam the wisdom of making peace and these efforts will be continued.  It is through her membership of the Commonwealth that Britain has the best opportunity for contributing to the advancement and well-being of so many peoples in the developing world on the basis of mutual trust and co-operation. Labour created the modern Commonwealth. We have always attached great importance to it as a unique association of peoples, spanning different races and continents of the world.  The Commonwealth needs further new development, if it is to remain a coherent force in world affairs. During the past year, Labour has taken, with the Commonwealth, a number of important initiatives which will greatly affect its future.  FIRSTLY: We have established a Secretariat which will be concerned with planning the future political, organisational and economic relationships of Commonwealth countries.  SECONDLY: The Commonwealth, as such, took an unprecedented Initiative for peace in establishing the Peace Mission to try to end the tragic conflict in Vietnam. While this initiative was not successful, it nevertheless points to a further and most important development of the Commonwealth.  THIRDLY: Britain has made clear, particularly in the confrontation between Malaysia and Indonesia, her willingness to assist the new Commonwealth nations when faced with external aggression.  Labour will continue to foster the development of the Commonwealth by participating fully in schemes for financial, economic and technical co-operation.  In just over a year independence arrangements have been made for a quarter of Britain's remaining Colonial subjects, and a new status, carrying with it the right to opt for independence, has been offered to six Eastern Caribbean islands. This new status is an exciting adventure in Common wealth relations and may well prove a model for other small communities who wish to free themselves from any Colonial stigma and yet remain in close association with Britain.  Constitutional changes have been made in other Colonies, and Labour's policy remains:  To give independence to all territories which want it and can sustain it. To help all other small dependencies which are unlikely to be able to stand on their own feet to achieve a new post-Colonial status of dignity in association with Britain.  6. THE WAR ON WANT  In spite of the tremendous economic difficulties we faced, Labour has increased the flow of external aid to developing nations both inside and outside the Commonwealth. The effectiveness of this aid has been greatly increased by the co-ordination and careful scrutiny of programmes undertaken by the new Ministry of Overseas Development While there is an obvious limit to the volume of capital that Britain can afford to export, very much more can be done and will be done to promote the flow of technical advice and assistance. In particular we shall multiply our efforts to assist overseas development through the export of knowledge. The flow of experts will be stimulated by redoubling the recruitment efforts of the Ministry of Overseas Development and by continued support of recruitment by voluntary bodies, private agencies, foundations and the British Council.  We shall make our aid more effective by helping recipient countries to plan their development and to select worthwhile projects on which to spend our aid. We shall continue to lighten the burden of debt by softening the terms of aid. For we recognise that ""aid"" can be negated by ""trade"" unless a concerted world effort is made to enable overseas countries to earn the foreign exchange essential to their development programmes. Labour will play a positive part at next year's United Nations Conference on Trade and Development. We intend to put our full weight behind constructive inter national proposals for increasing and stabilising the export earnings of primary producing countries through international commodity agreements and arrangements for finance; for reduction of trade barriers; and for increasing liquidity for financing world trade, with particular emphasis on schemes for linking the creation of new credits to the needs of underdeveloped countries.  By such means a Labour Government will mobilise increasing resources - in money, expert advice and voluntary effort - to make war on want.  Postscript  This postscript is also a preface - an introduction to (we believe) four or five years of Labour Government with the Parliamentary majority needed to carry through our plan for a better Britain.  We have already shown that, even with a tiny majority, Labour Government WORKS. But it would be foolish to pretend that we can do all that we mean to do with such a majority; for, make no mistake about it, some of our projects will be bitterly resisted by those whose privileges and interests are threatened.  Already the pattern and the mood are clear. Even Tories admit, in private, that the conduct of Harold Wilson and his colleagues has been far more firm and decisive than they thought it could be. This is a Government that GOVERNS: it does not flop along from crisis to crisis as the Tories did, for so much of their 13 years.  Moreover, the motive and inspiration of Labour remain, and always will remain, to secure the prosperity and welfare of all the people - the workers by hand and by brain who must be the backbone of our economic recovery, the old, the sick and the children.  This is not a selfish motive - but you will be doing yourself and your family a good turn by voting Labour on 31st March. After all, YOU KNOW LABOUR GOVERNMENT WORKS. "
NA,196603,"For All the People: the Liberal Plan of 1966  BRITAIN DEMANDS A NEW APPROACH  Eighteen months ago many people had high hopes that a change of Government from Conservative to Labour would bring about a real change in the country's fortunes. They had watched the country drift from one economic crisis to another and seen how Britain's rate of expansion and industrial growth had continued to fall behind that of other countries.  Now events have shown that, for all their talk about modernisation, Labour too cannot find the answer to our problems. However admirable their intentions. they, like the Conservatives, have been unable to implement workable solutions.  There are very simple reasons for this. Both parties have their roots firmly in one section of the community or another. The Conservatives. both ideologically and financially, are still tied to the interests of capital. Equally Labour are tied to the interests of the Unions, often to the detriment of both.  Is it surprising that their actions are seldom acceptable or effective for the country as a whole?  WHY ARE THE LIBERALS DIFFERENT? Today, more than ever, the unique position of the Liberal Party enables us to bring new thinking and a fresh, objective approach to Britain's economic and social problems and to put forward solutions that work. We can do this precisely because we have no vested interest in protecting one group or another. We are not a class party'. We draw our support from all groups and classes and we are free to reconcile conflicting interests for the benefit of the whole community. We are the party of all individuals, no matter what their background.  WHAT THE LIBERALS HAVE ACHIEVED. Already the three million votes polled at the last election in support of Liberal attitudes and Liberal policies have acted as a powerful brake and a positive influence on the policies of the Labour Government. Indeed the Liberal Party has provided the only effective opposition n curbing the wasteful excesses of Socialism and compelling Labour to give priority to at least some of the things that matter.  STEEL NATIONALISATION was shelved as a result of Liberal pressure and saved the country millions of pounds. Without that pressure it could still happen.  LAND NATIONALISATION was checked in response to Liberal pressure. The nationalisation of small plots of building land in private ownership has been dropped.  PENSIONS AND RATES. Although Labour's plans do not go far enough Liberal pressure has forced the Government to put these issues before further nationalisation plans.  THE NEGLECTED REGIONS. For years Liberals have been calling for action to revitalise the depressed areas of Britain. Even the tentative moves now being made by Labour would not have been made but for Liberal pressure.  THE HIGHLAND DEVELOPMENT BOARD. A clear example of a Liberal proposal being implemented by Labour in response to pressure from the Highland Liberal MPs.  A REALLY POSITIVE VOTE. The effectiveness of Liberal pressure to date is only the beginning. An increased number of Liberal MPs and an increased Liberal vote in each constituency will bring about still more positive action in Parliament. And there is plenty to be done.  The most vital need is for a fresh and realistic approach to economic planning, defence and the machinery of government, because only then will the wealth be created that can bring about a real improvement in living standards, housing, education and the social services for all the people of Britain.  The policies outlined show the positive action that is needed. Consider them carefully and decide for yourself.  Three million people voted Liberal last time for what they knew was right. The 10 Liberal MP's have done the work of 30 times that many. Those votes have really counted. A higher vote. More MPs. The same drive. And a Liberal Government will be near.  HOW TO CREATE THE WEALTH  BRITAIN MUST PAY HER WAY  FACING WORLD REALITIES. Britain today has the slowest rate of growth of any developed industrial economy. By 1980, if present trends continue, the only countries in Western Europe with a lower living standard will be Portugal and Spain. One reason for this pitiful performance is the attempt to carry world responsibilities far beyond our means.  In 1964 Britain's military spending overseas was £305 million, accounting for over half the country's debt. Expenditure of this kind hits us all.  The Labour Government is now trying to cut it down, but it has failed to cut the basic commitments, which made us spend the money, many of which are no longer realistic.  Britain is also still the centre of a world wide currency system. Attempts to sustain the system have placed our economic policy in a strait-jacket and added a further restriction on our growth. In consequence we now have the largest debt in our history.  The Government must work for a radical reform of the world's financial system, in which we shall pool our exchange reserves with those of other Western powers and jointly assume responsibility for managing a new reserve currency.  While illusions of military and economic grandeur must be dropped, British industry needs the wider horizon of the Common Market. British exports to Europe have suffered badly from our exclusion. Waiting for something to turn up is not a policy. Britain must declare now her intention to join the European Community.  GROWTH COMES FIRST. The Labour Government has now set up a Department of Economic Affairs, but real power over economic policy still remains in the cautious hands of the Treasury. The Department of Economic Affairs can only become a real driving force for expansion if it has authority over short term as well as long term planning. It should work in partnership with a new Parliamentary standing committee on economic affairs in the formulation, execution and continuous modification of a new national economic plan.  SIMPLIFY THE TAX SYSTEM. The tax system must be overhauled and simplified so that it encourages efficiency rather than evasion. A standing committee of experts from industry, finance and Government must be set up to fit successive budgetary measures into a sustained programme of tax reform.  CUT DIRECT TAXATION. Direct taxation must be systematically cut and some of the burden shifted to inherited wealth and gifts. Death duties should be replaced by a legacy duty, to encourage the wider distribution of wealth.  Tax reliefs for industrial investment, even after the new grants, are less than they were two years ago. They should be restored to the previous level and increased as soon as possible to a level comparable with that of other industrial countries. Office machinery and services which earn foreign exchange should be allowed to benefit from investment grants.  BRING DOWN PRICES. All people, but particularly the old and those living on fixed incomes, are hit by constantly rising prices. Between 1951 and 1964 the value of the E dropped to 13s. 0d. Since the last Election the cost of living has risen by a further 13s. 0d in the pound.  The effective way to bring down prices is to increase competition by cutting tariffs. Because this would hit monopolies and price rings it would increase efficiency, and prices would fall accordingly. If necessary the maintenance of price rings and gross restrictive practices should be made criminal offences.  A POSITIVE INCOMES POLICY. An Incomes Policy is a necessary aid, if we are to check inflation with a minimum of unemployment, and achieve a fair distribution of the wealth we have, but to succeed an incomes policy must emphasise the need for greater productivity and efficiency before wages and incomes are increased.  In Western Germany reasonable price stability has been maintained, with only 1 per cent unemployment (less than in Britain today), thanks to planned immigration, generous redundancy arrangements and systematic training to induce people to change jobs. In Britain, an ambitious retraining programme is needed with payment of average national earnings during retraining. Longer periods of notice should be given to those who must change jobs. There must be a greater expansion in management training and shorter and more flexible apprenticeships.  Where there is direct confrontation with a large Union, Government intervention by tariff cuts or taxes may sometimes be necessary to prevent exorbitant wage increases in particular industries, but we would prefer wage increases to be restricted voluntarily. Labour's Prices and Incomes Bill can only undermine the confidence of the Unions.  Government pressure should be exerted to create strong unions covering whole industries and to rationalise the wage structure. Bargaining at individual plant level, in which higher earnings are negotiated in return for abandonment of restrictive practices, must be encouraged.  PARTNERSHIP IN INDUSTRY PAYS  GETTING BOTH 'SIDES' TOGETHER. Strikes, stoppages and demarcation disputes are three major causes of Britain's failure to pay her way. Too often they arise from class prejudices, the failure of employer and employee to understand each other's problems and the lack of any common purpose between them.  Each 'side's' distrust of the other's interests has led to inefficiency and prevented any lasting solution being reached. The Liberal Panty, bound by no such interests, is in a unique position to bring the two 'sides' together and be accepted in doing so.  A 'SAY'. The first step must be to give employees more say in the running of the companies in which they work. Company law must be amended to require the setting up of Works Councils for regular consultation and negotiation between employee and management on all major issues affecting their company.  A STAKE. Employees must be given the same status as shareholders and the consequent right to elect directors to the Board.  Management should be encouraged by tax incentives to increase employee shareholding, because a financial stake is an important part of a man's involvement with, and responsibility to, the company for which he works.  Industrial efficiency depends on partnership not conflict. Our proposals would bring about this partnership.  CONTRACTS OF SERVICE. A standard contract of service should be introduced covering the right to Union representation; an equal range of security benefits for wage and salary earners; holiday pay based on average earnings; a guaranteed opportunity for further education and training in employer's time; and equal rates of pay for men and women doing identical work. With such contracts it would be easier to gain the acceptance of arbitration rather than the immediate resort to industrial force and the contracts could be enforceable in the civil courts.  HARNESS TECHNOLOGY. The establishment of the Ministry of Technology has not led to the 'white hot scientific revolution' promised by Labour before the last election. There have been small increases in government financed support for the National Research Development Corporation and for computers, but the machinery for science and technology is much the same as it was under the Tories.  Among Liberal proposals are expansion of the Atomic Energy Programme, reorganisation of the Council for Scientific Policy, with wider terms of reference, better co-ordination of the Work and Research Associations and full transferability of pensions for the Civil Service so as to ensure mobility of scientific manpower.  EXPANSION IN FARMING PAYS  If you are a farmer or farm worker, today you can have little cause for satisfaction with Conservative and Labour farming policies. Both parties have allowed farming to drift The farmer's life is hedged about with uncertainty. He never knows whether to expand or contract. His workers often leave the land.  If you are a housewife, you too will have seen how this uncertainty has brought fluctuations and increases in the prices of meat, milk and dairy produce.  A few years ago only the Liberal Party recognised the need for selective expansion in food production. We called for a system of managed markets for home and imported produce under a Meat and Grain Commission, and a system of agricultural support that gave the farmer his return from the market rather than from subsidies, and one that guaranteed reasonable prices to the housewife.  The other parties now favour agricultural expansion, but the Labour proposals in the National Plan envisage a rate of growth in beef and pork production slower than that of the last five years. Only the dairy herd is set for expansion but the incentive to farmers is insufficient.  We welcome Labour's tentative scheme for easier farm credit, but we would extend it by a Land Banking system to help bona fide small farmers and ex-farm workers to make their farms efficient and modern.  BETTER PRICES FOR BEEF. If this country wants beef the Government must recognise the need to pay substantially more to the producer. Substantial price increases would in turn give the producer a higher price for calves and enable marginal milk producers to turn over to livestock. The confidence n expansion created would remove the need to raise milk prices to the housewife.  CEREALS EXPANSION. As long as subsidies remain at their present level, there will be uncertainty for both Government and farmer. With a managed cereal market the price could be gradually raised until the subsidy is eliminated.  COST. These price adjustments would be self-balancing. The money saved on cereal subsidies and the levies collected on imports would provide sufficient funds for the increase  n livestock prices. Introduced over a period of years, this new system and increased technological investment in farming would create for the farmer the firm prospect of expansion, a real increase in income, and a decreasing dependence on imported produce.  BRING NEW LIFE TO THE NEGLECTED REGIONS  A NATIONAL PHYSICAL PLAN. For too many people there is little incentive to stay in the area of their birth. Culturally and financially the draw is toward the South East.  While Britain has a national plan for the economy, there is no national physical plan to redress this balance. The drift to the South East continues. Only in the Highlands, where the Liberals swept the board at the last Election, has Labour, under pressure, set up a Development Board with money and real powers.  There must be a national plan for the future redistribution of population and development and the decentralisation of power and wealth from London.  SCOTLAND AND WALES. Greater power to run their own affairs must be given to the people of Scotland and Wales.  The Royal Commission on Scottish Local Government must be extended to examine particularly the devolution of power from Whitehall to Edinburgh with a view to establishing an elected Scottish Parliament.  A Council of Wales must be established and a Welsh Development Agency set up to plan, to tend money and to promote new industries.  There must be broader regional tax advantages to stimulate development in Northern Ireland.  ELECTED REGIONAL COUNCILS. Regional Councils nominated by the Central Government give those who live in the regions neither a say in their affairs nor a responsibility for them. Regional councillors must be elected - and paid. This is not a part-time job for amateurs.  Regional Councils throughout Britain must have full powers to co-ordinate all the industrial and cultural development within their regions. They must have their own financial resources and power to borrow, especially for physical re-development.  POWER TO PLAN. Regional Councils can only be effective if they have the executive power to plan for their areas. They should be responsible for the use of land, including new towns and new industries, public transport and hospital building, water supplies, regional resources and all facilities for leisure and the arts.  An effective regional policy also demands the decentralisation of Government offices and the nationalised industries, and the appointment of Regional Officers with status equivalent to the Civil Servant.  REFORM LOCAL GOVERNMENT. Our system of local government badly needs to become a more effective instrument of the electors' will. The aldermanic system in England and Wales should be abolished. All trading arrangements by Councillors with their Council should be disclosed in the minutes. The resources and functions of smaller local authorities should be merged to ensure that effective people are employed and efficient services provided at the most economic price.  A RADICAL APPROACH TO TRANSPORT  Whether we are private motorists, farmers or industrialists, poor road and rail communications affect us all, but particularly they strike at the root of exports, regional development, prices and agricultural expansion. Yet Britain's motorway network is smaller than that built in Germany thirty years ago, and under the National Plan investment in new roads gets a pitiful low priority.  A network of motorways can and must be constructed without throwing an additional burden on the taxpayer. Those who use roads want to see results. The new motorways should be Pay Roads. This would mean a small charge to the user, but it would be more than balanced by savings in fuel, delays, and wear and tear.  It would enable public loans to be raised, to build the roads quickly, and would provide a communication system to galvanise the economy.  British Rail's passenger and freight services must be rationalised, co-ordinated, and streamlined to meet the real demands of the customer.  In other countries, air shuttle services between cities are profitable. Why not here? Our provincial airports must be modernised and the number of inter-city services and airports increased as the regions of Britain are developed.  NON-RACIALIST APPROACH TO IMMIGRATION  We believe that immigrant entry to this country should be regulated by the availability of jobs or the possession of skills and not fixed at an arbitrary figure bearing no relation to vacancies.  The problems connected with immigration have aroused tremendous emotion. No one should minimise the social problems created. But clearly anyone who reflects upon the work of doctors and nurses in our hospitals, employees in our transport services, and many other industries, will recognise the significant contribution which immigrants are making to our society.  We appreciate that integration is not always easy and, in order that the full contribution of the immigrant may be realised, more steps must be taken at national and local level to provide facilities for non-English speaking immigrants to improve their knowledge of English and the British way of life. There must be a closer co-ordination of action at national and local level to promote racial harmony.  Above all the 'immigrant problem' is a problem of housing. Special subsidies must be made available to Local Authorities in areas of acute housing shortage.  DEFENCE COMMITMENTS MUST BE CUT  Too great a proportion of our national wealth is spent in pursuing a world peacekeeping role that n many areas is no longer realistic and that in any case is far beyond our financial resources to fulfil effectively.  We appreciate Labour's wish to limit defence expenditure but they envisage no equivalent cut in commitments as Mr. Mayhew has so honestly pointed out.  REALISTIC PRIORITIES. We reject the idea that Britain still has an independent peacekeeping role East of Suez. The likelihood of our being required to act independently, in the defence of India and Pakistan for example, as the Tashkent Agreement demonstrates grows more remote. We should cut our commitments East of Suez accordingly.  Apart from a temporary obligation to Malaysia our role is as a member of the United Nations and not as an independent peace-keeping force. We must therefore plan today for a gradual reduction of our bases in the Far East.  THE DETERRENT. Events have proved that only the Liberals were sincerely opposed to Britain's possession of an independent nuclear deterrent. Labour in office, despite all they said in Opposition, have in fact committed us to a nuclear role for the next 10 years. Thereby Labour have made their task of reducing the arms bill more difficult and encouraged the spread of nuclear weapons.  However, as we still have certain nuclear weapons under our control, steps must be taken to place these weapons under international control within the Western Alliance.  SELECT COMMITTEE ON DEFENCE. During the past 10 years millions of the taxpayers' money have been wasted on unrealistic commitments and abandoned prestige defence projects.  Never has the need for a Select Committee on Defence (quite apart from the other Parliamentary reforms which Liberals advocate) been made more obvious than when the Government issued their defence review on February 22nd. Here were policies, which will virtually affect the defence of the United Kingdom for the next decade, which had never been discussed in Parliament or by Parliament until the decisions had been taken and were irrevocable.  Our priority should be to ensure the security of the United Kingdom by retaining an effective defence force in Western Europe, which, by its very presence, will help to maintain our political influence in that area.  By cutting our Far East commitments we shall be able to do this and still bring defence expenditure into reasonable proportion.  DISARMAMENT. We must call for a freeze in the development of nuclear weapons, work to establish nuclear free zones; and press for the admission of China to the UN and disarmament discussions.  MODERNISE THE MACHINERY OF GOVERNMENT  The prestige and influence of Parliament has declined. While the British electorate is often able to participate in the great formative debates of American democracy on television, too often major issues are discussed by Parliament only after the event.  The decline of Parliament must be arrested by radical reform of its procedures. Standing Committees on Foreign Affairs, Defence, Economics and Science and Technology must be set up so that Parliament shares from the beginning in the formulation of policy. Television, the medium of political debate, must be brought into the House of Commons.  STREAMLINE ADMINISTRATION. Labour has set up new Ministries, but this has not led to quicker decisions or more efficient planning. Indeed it has sometimes led to duplication and made problems worse. Administration must be streamlined to give value for money. Economics. Technology, and Social Security must each be the responsibility of a single Minister. The Housing and Local Government Ministries must be co-ordinated in a Ministry for Regional Planning and Development, within which Housing and Transport would become subordinated departments. Detailed planning would be decentralised to the Regional Councils.  The appointment of senior Ministers in charge of broad areas of policy would make possible a smaller and more efficient cabinet, comparable to Churchill's wartime machine.  Civil Service rules must be made more flexible to allow able people to be brought in from outside. But the test must be ability not political views. A small unit, set up by the Treasury, would ensure that recruitment of outsiders is fair and taps the best brains.  ELECTORAL REFORM. The Electoral system must be reformed to ensure that membership of the House of Commons represents more accurately the will of the people. Through the Speaker's Conference we shall continue to press for changes in the method of voting. A system which allowed over three million voters only nine members of Parliament and which made it possible for a party with less than half the total vote to become the Government, is clearly in need of a radical overhaul.  The changes we propose would ensure that every vote cast really counted. and would dispel the present electoral apathy.  We shall press for votes for young people at 18. Today's youth is responsible and should be treated as such. At present, until they are 21 young people may not, without their parents' consent, travel abroad or enter into any legal contract including a mortgage, nor may they vote.  Full rights should be granted at 18.  HOW TO IMPROVE YOUR WAY OF LIFE  YOUR HOME AND YOUR RATES  Millions still live in slums or have no house of their own. Millions more have homes without lavatories and running water.  To rid the country of slums and shortage and build sufficient dwellings for all families to have their own homes, we must build at least five million homes within the next 10 years.  This can be done if we tackle the real causes of the problem.  INDUSTRIALISED BUILDING TECHNIQUES. System builders' factories run at a fraction of their capacity. Regional Planning Offices must be set up to co-ordinate these resources, guide the housing effort and speed the creation of housing consortia among Local Authorities. Only from large scale housing schemes can the full benefits of industrialised building be obtained. Building land is available but too little use is made of it.  Labour's Land Commission will do nothing to correct this. It will simply discourage owners from selling, and the badly devised levy will make land still dearer.  Site value rating. which would collect rates on the value of land instead of buildings, would encourage owners of vacant or underdeveloped land to sell instead of holding on for a better market price.  HOMES TO RENT HELP FOR BUYERS. Much new housing must go to cure the acute short age of homes to rent at reasonable prices. Help from subsidies for Council Houses should be concentrated on those who cannot afford to pay the full economic rent and on Local Authorities with exceptional rehousing needs, particularly in areas where there has been a large increase in the immigrant population.  The Government must also encourage more capital to be invested in cheap privately built homes for rent. Tax reliefs should be given to landlords who build low rent houses, with rent controlled at a level which gives them a reasonable but not exorbitant return.  The present pattern of tax relief for home buyers, which helps a rich person taking out a mortgage and not those with little money, should be reversed, possibly by a straight interest rate subsidy, paid to the Building Societies on all mortgages up to £4,000. A Government fund should back one hundred per cent mortgages through Local Authorities and Building Societies.  KEEPING THE RATES DOWN. A complete change in the rate structure is urgently needed. The proposed Liberal tax on land values would spread the load and bring down the cost to the individual ratepayer. The transfer to the Exchequer of a higher proportion of Education and Road costs would reduce it further. The loss of income by Local Authorities should be guaranteed by an annual Government grant.  WHAT PRICE SECURITY AND HEALTH?  Security in old age, security in sickness, security in unemployment. these are our responsibilities to each other. The great Liberal concept of the Welfare State is threatened by its increasing failure to match real needs.  A long term plan linking benefits firmly to the general increase in national prosperity would ensure that all entitled to them share n the growing national wealth.  SECURITY IN RETIREMENT. Even after the 1965 increase in pensions, many old people are still forced to live on National Assistance and will be forced to still further as the cost of living rises; pensions should be raised high enough to make it unnecessary for them to ask for extra help. A reasonable level for a married couple would be half the level of average national earnings, rising accordingly.  These pensions should be paid to all old people, including those registered before 1948, the earnings rule which prevents pensioners from earning a little extra must be abolished.  Employees should be encouraged, through their unions and professional associations, to supplement the State pension with occupational schemes to a level not less than two-thirds of previous earnings; and pension rights must be fully transferable. Liberals oppose the idea of a monopolistic State Socialist Scheme.  At present an employee, as well as paying for his Insurance Stamp, has to contribute with his employer to the State Graduated Pension Scheme. The same money invested in a private insurance scheme would yield him a much higher pension. He should have the right to choose where he invests this extra money.  SECURITY IN SICKNESS AND UNEMPLOYMENT. Sick pay and unemployment benefits must be raised to a realistic level. Two thirds of previous earnings should be the rule and full national average earnings for those undergoing retraining for a new job.  SECURITY FOR WIVES, WIDOWS AND CHILDREN. The present system of family allowances which mainly benefit the better off, should be abolished. All children including the first should be eligible under a new system of allowances, graded from approximately £1 to £3 according to age. A widow with dependent children should receive from halt to two-thirds of her husband's previous earnings, and others should receive sickness, unemployment or retraining benefits like anyone else. The present tax system discriminates against wives who, of necessity, have to stay at home, and it should be re-examined.  HOW WILL IT ALL BE PAID FOR? A closer partnership between State and private industry will help to rationalise the present wasteful contribution structure. A Social Security Tax, replacing National Insurance stamps and levied on employer (two thirds) and employee (one third) in proportion to the payroll would rationalise it still further. The tax should be varied regionally to encourage the creation of more jobs in areas of unemployment. Benefits on this scale will not be cheap and will take time to achieve, but would ensure maximum value for money contributed.  A BETTER HEALTH SERVICE. At present, unless you can afford to pay privately. your chances of obtaining a hospital bed at short notice are small. Even when you de you will find most of our hospitals crippled by shortages of doctors, nurses and modern facilities. And the same is true of dentists and GPs.  We must make better use of the qualified people we have by reforming methods of payment and encouraging, not penalising. married women who wish to return to work.  We must make the Service more efficient by co-ordinating the various branches of health and welfare under Area Health Boards in which the GP would play a vital part.  Funds must be made available to these Boards to provide better facilities for dentists and GPs, to improve existing hospital buildings, to build new hospitals and to provide new homes for old people.  WHAT ARE YOUR CHILD'S CHANCES?  Although Conservative and Labour Governments have always expressed a desire to increase educational opportunity, in times of financial difficulty it is always education that they cut. Instead of setting up a proper building research group for Universities in order to bring down their costs, the Labour Government has simply imposed a six months' stop on building for Further and Higher Education thus throwing carefully phased plans into chaos.  We must get our plans and priorities right and then stick to them. Liberals recognise that education is the most important investment we can make.  SCHOOLS. Priority in school building must be given to bring our slum primary schools, urban and rural, up to a decent standard and to prepare for raising the school-leaving age. This means more generous support for minor works; special grants for depressed areas; and a willingness by Local Authorities to accept large scale industrial building.  ELEVEN PLUS. Liberals regard the abolition of all selection at eleven plus not as a dogmatic principle, but as a necessary and long overdue reform. We accept the need for detailed consultation at local level and we realise that not every area in the country can go 'fully comprehensive' immediately, nor do we regard the 'all-through, purpose-built eleven to nineteen comprehensive' as necessarily the best solution. We are fighting for reform in the interests of all the children, not in the interests of dogma or special privilege.  HIGHER EDUCATION. We reject the Labour Government's long-term aim of two separate systems, one autonomous under the University Grants Committee and the other 'public' under the Local Authorities. The links between Universities and other institutions of higher education should be drawn closer together by exercising public control through Regional Councils rather than the 160 different Local Authorities.  If the teacher shortage is to be conquered, there must be new methods of part-time training and re-training for teachers. n this connection we regret the Government's failure in this Parliament to establish the University of the Air, proposed originally by the Liberals and promised in the last Labour Manifesto.  TEACHERS. All professional teachers should be professionally trained and their salaries, working conditions and pensions improved. This could be done if many sub-professional jobs in schools were taken over by ancillary staff.  COST. The necessary improvements in our education cannot be made without expenditure of a higher proportion of the national income. We would oppose any plan to abolish all individual fee-paying schools although the role of the direct grant, grammar and independent schools must be re-examined.  A WORLD WE CAN MAKE BETTER  Liberals support the search for controlled disarmament. Meanwhile Britain must play her part in creating the conditions which will make the arms race unnecessary.  STRENGTHEN THE UNITED NATIONS. The United Nations must be made to work. A permanent UN force is needed. Liberals want Britain to contribute to it. Any British Government should support the authority of the UN in settling disputes between States and policing scenes of international violence.  Liberals recognise that Britain is a European power. We cannot afford to carry responsibilities everywhere, and the East of Suez policy, persisted in by Labour, is as dubious politically as it is expensive militarily.  JOIN EUROPE. To play our part in Europe would not only be of great economic benefit it would make us a pioneer in the first supranational community where States have agreed to share some of their sovereignty. Liberals want the Government to declare its intention of joining the EEC at the earliest opportunity.  Once in Europe, Britain could be an effective Atlantic ally and with our fellow Europeans we could hope to influence American policy in places like Vietnam. Liberals believe in the late President Kennedy's concept of the Atlantic partnership between the USA and United Europe. Such a partnership would wield great power for progress.  HUNGER AND DISEASE - THE WORLD'S GREAT ENEMIES. Effective aid to the hungry millions of Asia, Africa and Latin-America means not only direct support but a co-operative effort by the rich States in the expansion of trade to the developing countries, through the reduction of tariffs and more credits and investment.  THE COMMONWEALTH. British aid is naturally largely directed to the Commonwealth countries. Although the Commonwealth consists of loosely linked and widely different nations it remains a valuable association bridging the gap between races. It will lose that value and the gap will widen if Britain compromises with racialism.  RHODESIA. The rebel regime in Rhodesia is not only defying the Crown and imposing an increasingly oppressive dictatorship. It is also poisoning race relations throughout Africa. Liberals therefore recognise the necessity of continuing pressure until the rebel regime can be replaced by an authority - representing all Rhodesians, willing to work for eventual independence based on majority rule and backed by effective British guarantees.  The challenges today are tough, but if they are met in Europe, and in United Nations as in Rhodesia, Britain can play a great part n the advance to peace.  CONCLUSION  NOW IT IS UP TO YOU  Liberals are guided by principle not by doctrine. We are not frightened by change. We welcome it, provided that it is directed towards the real priorities.  If Britain is going to continue to play a significant part in the world there must be a radical change of attitude in Government. We can provide this because we are free to plan for the best interest of all individuals, not just for a few. And that means _your_ interests. We want to see positive action to create a closer partnership between all sections of the community - State and private enterprise, employer and employee, business and union - Only we can bring about this partnership.  If you want to see positive actions based on Liberal ideas flourish, you know what you must do. It is up to you."
"Conservatives",196603,"Action Not Words: The New Conservative Programme  FOREWORD  I present to the people of Britain a manifesto which is also a blueprint It is a blueprint not for a year but for a full Parliament I am deter mined to promise nothing that we cannot achieve. I know that we shall inherit from the Labour Government a weak economic position, and I intend to give first priority to the management of our economy, to the strengthening of Britain's competitive position in world markets and to the repayment of the heavy burden of debt which they have incurred.  Equally I am determined to break away from the growing constraint of Socialism and the dreariness which stems from it: from the pattern of inflation and stagnant production which has been created.  I want to see our social services recognise the overriding claims of those in most need. I want to see choice become once more part of the pattern of life of the individual. I want to see our country with confidence in itself and in the future taking its place in the European Economic Community.  These are the things we must achieve. This manifesto points the way. I ask now for your confidence so that we can put it into effect I call not for words - but for action.  EDWARD HEATH  OUR NEW CONSERVATIVE PROGRAMME  This is what we are going to do:  - Get the economy straight, check rising prices, and restore expansion.  - Reform the trade unions.  - Remodel the Welfare State.  - Get the nation properly housed.  - Restore respect for Britain and lead her into Europe.  THE LABOUR RECORD  In October 1964 the Labour Government came to power promising action. Since then we have had many more promises. And many words. But the one thing we have not had is action. For eighteen months we have been waiting while the Labour leaders talk. But their words have had little relation to the facts.  The Labour Government has had its opportunity and it has failed. It's easy enough to say 'Let's be fair to Labour. Give them another chance.' But it would be taking an immense chance with everybody's future to do so. We cannot afford to sit and wait for the other failures and blunders that will be coming our way if Labour is left in charge.  Just look at their record. The Labour leaders have failed to tackle the fundamental economic and social problems at home. Abroad Britain's reputation has declined under their clumsy and uncertain touch. In the High Street prices are rising. Up go rates and taxes, down go standards of service on the buses and trains and in other public industries. The road programme is held up. The universities and technical colleges have had to cut back their expansion plans. The housing target has been missed. Mortgage rates are higher than ever. Complicated tax penalties are sapping individual enterprise. Production in industry is stagnating.  It is a depressing catalogue. It is hard to see how any one of us, whatever our job or whatever our attitude to politics, can be satisfied with the situation into which we have now drifted. Nor can anyone be content to let this sort of thing go on. This is not the kind of Britain we want.  All those who really believe in this country must know in their hearts that we can do far, far better, given energy and imagination. And not only for ourselves, but for our families, our communities and for the millions overseas who rely on a strong and free Britain.  THE CONSERVATIVE WAY AHEAD  The alternative to Labour drift is less talk and gimmickry, and more positive action. The alternative is a government team which means what it says and knows what it intends to do: a government that doesn't run away; an honest government.  Our first aim is this: to run this country's affairs efficiently and realistically so that we achieve steadier prices in the shops, high wages and a really decent standard of social security.  With sensible and determined action and our new Conservative policies we can reach these goals. But we have to be quite clear what this means. It means that we must give every man and woman a chance to play a decisive and worthwhile part in restoring Britain's health and strength and confidence. It means that our best brains must be encouraged and rewarded so that they can get on and succeed. It means that there must be a war on inefficiency and waste in the public industries - as well as in Whitehall and in the town hall. It means that pride, self-confidence and efficiency must replace the suspicion and the 'who cares?' attitude which weaken industry and hold us all back.  Now to get to these goals here are the action programmes which we will be starting on as soon as we form a government.  - First the next Conservative Government will not hesitate to take all the measures necessary to deal with the immediate economic situation. Our new economic programme will make a prices and incomes policy really effective.  - Second, we will use tax incentives to encourage individual men and women to earn and save more for themselves and their families.  - Third, our new policies for competition will inject fresh vitality into British industry, keeping prices down and quality up, and giving the housewife the service she deserves.  - Fourth, we will be launching new industrial policies, involving major reforms of both management and unions. At last the barriers in the way of higher productivity and higher earnings will be brought down.  - Fifth, we will be making big changes in the organisation of our government and public services.  - Sixth, we will start new programmes for speeding up the spread of prosperity to the English regions, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.  - Seventh, the strategy of the new Conservative Government will be to throw everything this country has in skill, resources and brainpower behind the things at which Britain is best. We intend to see British quality again become the pace-setter in world markets and British services again become the envy of the world. And we intend to bring in the men who can do the job.  We intend to reform both British management and British trade unions.  Everyone is fed up with pointless strikes and outdated management. We reject the argument that there is a clash between the interests of management and workpeople. Higher wages, good profits and competitive products are in the interests of both. Efficient production and stable prices are what the customer wants.  Here are the action programmes we shall be introducing to bring this about.  - First, we will be transforming industrial relations by introducing a new Act covering the trade unions and employers' associations.  - Second, we will be turning the heat on restrictive practices by both management and labour so that men and women can do a decent job unhampered by the fears and restrictions which belong to another age.  - Third, we want to see better job prospects with greater security of incomes and pensions in the new high-wage low-cost economy.  We intend to revitalise our Welfare State so that those most in need get the most help and so that our money is used sensibly and fairly. We will be working to a fresh pattern of social priorities to meet new needs and help build our community on more responsible lines.  We want to see more generous help for those who have special needs not yet met by the Welfare State. We want to see family life strengthened by our Conservative social policies. We intend that there should be full equality of opportunity but not that we should all be equally held back to the pace of the slowest. Our policies are designed to bring higher quality and wider choice into our lives. We reject the kind of outdated thinking which leads to cuts in university and college expansion in order to provide free drugs for all.  Here are the action programmes which make up the new Conservative social policy and which will fulfil our aims.  - First, an entirely new social security strategy designed to concentrate better care and the biggest benefits on those most in need.  - Second, wider ownership - not only of houses but of pension rights and other forms of capital as well.  - Third, full educational opportunity, putting the needs of the individual child before Party doctrine. The first thing is to get more colleges and schools built, particularly primary schools, and more teachers trained.  - Fourth, an all out attack on the rising wave of crime which today besmirches our society.  - Fifth, fair treatment for immigrants combined with stricter control of entry.  - Sixth, more regional administration with strong and modernised local government.  - Seventh, better conditions for the car driver, the commuter and the travelling public generally.  - Finally, a countryside preserved where it is beautiful and transformed where it is ugly and derelict.  We intend to see that this entire nation is decently housed.  Our aim is more choice in housing. We are determined to see house prices in reach of those eager to buy homes of their own. We are determined to see that the needs of people for rented accommodation are more effectively met.  Here are the action programmes we intend to launch.  - First we will raise the housing target to an annual rate of 500,000 homes by the end of 1968. We reached our target before, and we will hit it again. We will make use of every new method that works to get the houses up and keep the prices down. And there will be major reforms in planning procedure to increase the supply of land for building.  - Second, we will encourage more people to buy their own homes - by aid with deposits or help with interest payments or by assisting with the purchase of older houses.  - Third, the next Conservative Government will speed up council house building for slum areas. And we will insist on sensible local authority rent policies.  We are determined to give Britain a respected place in the world again and lead her into the European Community.  Britain must be part of a wider grouping if she is to exert her full influence in the world. British industry must have far bigger markets if it is to develop on the scale required in so many cases by modern technology.  This can best be achieved by Britain becoming a member of an enlarged European Economic Community to which she herself has so much to contribute.  A strong Britain can provide a powerful trading partner, and a growing source of skill, knowledge and capital, for the other members of the Commonwealth. This way also lies the best chance of Britain helping the developing countries.  That is why we shall seize the first favourable opportunity of becoming a member of the Community.  These are our aims. The detailed proposals which follow show how we will achieve them.  Together they form a powerful new strategy-based on sound Conservative principles - to replace words with action, and promises with achievements.  BLUEPRINT FOR A PARLIAMENT  TO ENSURE PROSPERITY WITH STEADIER PRICES  Get taxes down again so as to encourage hard work and enterprise.  Encourage wider ownership. Drastically revise Labour's ill-prepared tax changes which penalise saving and go-ahead companies.  Get better management by improving management education at all levels.  Reform company law-doing the whole job instead of Labour's inadequate proposals.  Mount a new attack on restrictive business practices which hurt the public interest. Close the legal loop-holes Labour have left open.  Speed up and give more punch to the Monopolies Commission. And cut tariffs wherever it can be shown that competition from abroad is needed to deal with monopolies.  Set up a Small Business Development Bureau to help small firms start and grow.  Step up opportunities to train and retrain for better, more highly paid jobs. Build up the Youth Employment Service into a Careers Advisory Service for adults as well as young people.  Help the housewife with new legislation on misleading 'guarantees' and more vigorous use of safety standards for food and household goods.  Abolish the out-dated restrictions on the hours during which shops can open on week days.  Start a new drive to put the customer first in the nationalised industries and to increase efficiency in these and other public services.  Stimulate the new technological industries at which Britain excels. Provide the aerospace industry with a stable long-term programme based on European co-operation.  Stop the war in Whitehall between rival economic Ministers with conflicting policies. Put one man in charge with one firm policy which hangs together.  Start a war on waste in Government. Establish a Cost Effectiveness Department to introduce new management techniques into all Government Departments. Use sophisticated computer techniques to study the feasibility of Government projects.  Make greater use of the knowledge available in the universities and industry in the formation of Government policy. In particular, enlist scientists, the universities and industrial consultants to help us prevent waste of taxpayers' money.  TO IMPROVE INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS  Pass a new Industrial Relations Act and establish a new Code of Good Industrial Relations Practice.  Ensure that agreements between unions and employers are kept by making them legally enforceable.  Establish a Registrar of trade unions and employers' associations. See that their rules are fair and meet the interests of the public.  Set up a new Industrial Court to deal with industrial disputes and claims for damages against unjust dismissal.  Introduce measures to deal with restrictive labour practices.  Repeal the Trade Disputes Act 1965 so as to help prevent intimidation.  TO PROVIDE BETTER TRANSPORT  Speed up the building of motorways with the aid of increased productivity in the road building industry.  Resume the task of increasing railway efficiency and of reducing the railway deficit.  Give independent airlines new opportunities to develop inter-city services.  Improve the traffic flow of big cities and the efficiency of public transport by traffic management and by building off-street parking.  Get on with the modernisation of our ports. End the casual employment system. Reduce the number of different employers. Improve working relations - for example, see that better welfare facilities are provided.  TO HELP AGRICULTURE  Give Britain's farmers scope to supply a bigger share of the home market for food.  Move over gradually from Exchequer deficiency payments to a system of import control.  Maintain the support given by the Agriculture Acts throughout the transition stage, and ensure continued support in any legislation required to implement our new proposals.  Keep production grants and special help (e.g. small farms, farm improvements and hill farms).  Modernise the main horticultural markets, give continued support to co-operation and encourage better marketing techniques.  TO GET INTO EUROPE  Work energetically for entry into the European Common Market at the first favourable opportunity.  Prepare for entry by relating the development of our own policies to those of the Common Market, wherever appropriate.  Encourage co-operation with other European countries in joint projects which need not await our membership of the Common Market: particularly where large-scale scientific and technological resources are called for.  TO PROVIDE MOST CARE FOR THOSE IN NEED  See that everyone has a good pension with their job, on top of the State basic pension.  Ensure that everyone can either transfer or preserve their pension when they change jobs.  Give more generous help to children in families where the income is below minimum need, to the very old, to the chronic sick, to the severely disabled and to others most in need.  Improve rehabilitation and retraining for the disabled.  Help people who have put by some savings, by raising the amount which can be disregarded before a supplementary pension is granted.  Continue to ease the earnings rule.  Provide a pension for those too old to be covered by National Insurance.  Combine the Ministry of Health, the Ministry of Pensions and National Insurance and the National Assistance Board into a single Department with local officers who would have a positive duty to seek out those needing help whether in cash or in care. The new Department would have a research organisation to pin-point changing needs.  Establish inspectors of welfare to improve co-ordination between local authority, hospital and voluntary services.  Encourage voluntary service.  End the present rigid age barrier of 50 which prevents some widows who have been out of employment for many years from getting any pension at all.  Give special help to areas where there is the most need - for example, bad housing and oversized school classes.  Restore - subject to wide exemptions (such as the elderly, chronic sick, disabled, expectant and nursing mothers) - prescription charges. Use the savings for higher social priorities including the hospital and medical service.  Improve the health service by giving family doctors closer contact with hospitals and with local health and welfare services. Improve conditions for doctors.  Review all public service and Armed Forces pensions every two years to ensure that they maintain their purchasing power. Reduce to 55 the age at which increased pensions become payable. Bring the pensions of those who retired before 1956 up to the same level as if they had retired then with appropriate increases since. Give special treatment to war pensioners and their widows.  TO PROVIDE BETTER EDUCATION  Get more teachers especially for the primary schools by expanding the Colleges of Education, enabling part-time teachers to qualify for pension, and giving more encouragement to married women who want to return to teaching.  See that more teaching aids are made available.  Give back to local authorities the freedom to make small improvements, for example, an extra classroom or better sanitation.  Encourage local education authorities to provide as full a range of courses as possible in all their secondary schools.  Judge proposals for reorganisation on their educational merits. Strongly oppose hasty and makeshift plans, especially in the big cities, for turning good grammar and secondary modern schools into comprehensive schools.  Give improvements to primary school accommodation priority over projects for building new comprehensive schools where adequate secondary accommodation already exists.  Give parents as much choice as possible by having diversity in the pattern of education. Give independent schools of high standing the opportunity to become direct grant schools, thus narrowing the gap between State schools and fee paying schools.  Establish an Educational Television Centre to encourage the best use of television - broadcast and closed circuit - in schools, colleges and universities.  Restore the university and further education buildings programmes cut by the Labour Government.  TO HOUSE THE NATION  Speed up house building. Reach our target of a rate of 500,000 new homes a year by the end of 1968. Use modern building methods and speed up planning procedures.  Help home buyers by these three methods, as appropriate:  - Helping with their deposits.  - Enabling people below the standard rate of tax who are buying their home to deduct from the interest payments on their mortgages an amount similar to the tax relief obtained by those who pay tax. People eligible for the present tax allowance will have the option of continuing it.  - Introducing again the scheme for Exchequer help for the buying of older houses through the Building Societies.  - Give home buyers a guarantee of good workmanship.  - Accelerate housing for the elderly.  - See that council house subsidies are concentrated on those who really need them.  - Increase council house building for slum clearance.  - Expand the work of Housing Associations, so as to provide more good homes, at reasonable prices.  - Introduce depreciation allowances to help provide more homes to rent.  - Maintain rent control where there is a shortage of houses.  - Legislate to allow ground leaseholders to buy or rent their houses on fair terms except where the property is to be redeveloped.  - Take £100 million off the rates - equivalent to one-tenth of the rate bill.  TO BEAT THE CRIME WAVE  Place responsibility for law and order and for the war against crime on the Home Secretary and the Secretary of State for Scotland.  Set up a central staff within the Home Office responsible for police strategy, intelligence and equipment.  Accelerate the amalgamation of local police forces and establish a clear chain of command. Within a national force of this kind, local loyalties can and will be preserved.  Ensure that the police have the organisation, manpower and equipment to do the job.  Make offenders pay restitution for the injuries and damage they have done. Replace many short term sentences by substantial fines.  Preserve the Juvenile Courts and expand the methods available for dealing with the problems of young people.  Train those in prison to become useful members of the community.  TO DEAL WITH THE PROBLEM OF IMMIGRATION  Ensure that all immigrants living in Britain are treated in all respects as equal citizens and without discrimination.  Introduce a conditional entry system which will control the initial time during which a new immigrant may stay, until permission is granted either permanently or for a further limited period.  Strengthen the arrangements for health checks for immigrants.  Require all immigrants to register the names of any dependants who might at any time wish to join them, so that their numbers will be known. In the case of new immigrants the number of dependants will be an important factor in deciding whether entry will be permitted.  Help immigrants already here to rejoin their families in their countries of origin, or to return with their families to these countries, if they so wish.  Combine stricter control of entry with special help where necessary to those areas where immigrants are concentrated.  TO BUILD A BETTER COUNTRY AND WIDEN OPPORTUNLTIES FOR RECREATION  Plan the coast and countryside in such a way as to increase their natural beauty, increase the holiday attractions of Britain, and encourage provision for the growing numbers who leave the towns to sail, ski, climb, picnic or go caravaning.  Create a new Coast and Countryside Commission with the powers to get on with the job, using the resources of both public authorities and private enterprise.  Open more inland water for recreation, provide more access for visitors to the National Forests, and secure a national network of camping and caravan sites.  Encourage the development of regional recreation areas, largely financed by private investment, on the model of the Lea Valley Scheme.  End the existing confusion and duplication of effort between at least five Ministries in Whitehall, by setting up within the Ministry of Housing and Local Government a Recreation Department.  Provide more choice and competition in broadcasting.  Encourage the arts, particularly in the provinces. Promote high standards of architecture and civic planning.  TO DEAL WITH THE SPECIAL PROBLEMS OF EACH AREA  Develop fully the resources of each region and maintain its character in consultation with local organisations. Accelerate action on regional studies.  Develop the growth zone idea which Labour has abandoned. Strengthen the public services in these areas by greater investment in communications, homes, schools and hospitals. Provide financial inducements for new industry.  Improve amenities: provide powers to clear away the industrial dereliction of yesterday.  TO BRING NEW PROSPERITY TO SCOTLAND  Expand Government Training Centres and technical education programmes in order to provide the new skills which our new industries need.  Make a greater allocation of funds for education in the Highlands, the Borders and other country areas.  Concentrate development in those areas where it is most needed and will do the most good.  Restore the cuts which the Labour Government has made in Scottish road-building and pursue policies which will stop transport costs rising so fast.  Encourage competition on Scottish air routes and ensure that the Highlands have services timed to suit the people who live and work there.  Make a top priority the clearance of the remaining slums in Glasgow, Edinburgh, Dundee and other cities by every type of building - private building, council building and housing associations.  Introduce sensible rent schemes for local authority housing.  Make the best use of our land resources outside the central belt by supporting the hill farmers, encouraging the expansion of forestry and planning special tourist areas.  Make the Scottish Tourist Board a more professional body and use it to stimulate the growth of the industry.  Modernise local government and its finance.  TO BRING NEW PROSPERITY TO WALES  Tackle the problem of depopulation in mid-Wales by constructing first class road communications from Shrewsbury to Cardigan Bay, by attracting new industries, and by revitalising existing towns and developing mid-Wales as an area of high amenity and a tourist attraction.  Develop the coastal road in North Wales from Queensferry to Caernarvon.  Encourage new industrial development in North and South Wales and the development of the South Wales ports under a group system.  Give special attention to the needs of the hill farming community.  Maintain a Secretary for Wales in the Cabinet.  Overhaul the structure and organisation of Local Government in Wales.  Legislate to allow ground leaseholders to buy or rent their houses on fair terms except where the property is to be redeveloped.  Expand higher education in Wales and grant independent status to each university college. The university college of Cardiff, the Welsh college of Advanced Technology and the National School of Medicine will form the Civic University of Cardiff.  Encourage and foster the culture and arts which are the characteristic of the Welsh people.  TO BRING NEW PROSPERITY TO NORTHERN IRELAND  Co-operate with the Northern Ireland Government in:  - Seeing that Northern Ireland, as an integral part of the U.K., shares fully in the economic growth of the rest of the country; in particular, that the counties west of the Bann share in growing prosperity.  - Improving basic services, such as the new road programmes now being planned.  - Offering inducements to new industry to raise employment.  - Promoting the interests of Ulster farmers, bearing particularly in mind the size of holdings and their distance from the rest of the British market.  TO STRENGTHEN THE COMMONWEALTH  Break the deadlock in Rhodesia by initiating talks with Mr. Smith and his colleagues for the purpose of obtaining a constitutional settlement, without any prior conditions on either side.  Strengthen and expand existing Commonwealth links by making full use of the Commonwealth Foundation, by encouraging the professional, legal, medical and educational Commonwealth Conferences and by acting on their recommendations where appropriate.  Encourage voluntary service overseas.  Help Commonwealth development by technical and other assistance, by joint or bi-lateral projects and by ensuring that all aid given is used to its maximum effect.  Work for the expansion of world and Commonwealth trade through the U.N. Trade and Development Board and the Kennedy Round tariff negotiations.  TO HELP PRESERVE WORLD PEACE  Make our contribution to NATO. Fulfil our treaty obligations in the Middle and Far East.  Maintain a combination of nuclear and conventional arms related to our financial resources to enable us to defend ourselves and to honour these commitments. In particular, go on with the building of the new aircraft carrier.  Maintain properly equipped Regular forces together with reserve forces - including the Territorial Army - suitable reorganised for their supporting roles.  Seek, with our allies, every means and opportunity of bringing an end to hostilities in the Far East, thus reducing the pressure on our resources in that area.  Seek to make the United Nations a more effective instrument for keeping peace.  Renew Conservative support for the admission of Communist China to the United Nations.  Give a new impetus to disarmament by pressing for an extension of the Nuclear Test Ban Treaty to underground tests and an agreement to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons."
"Labour",197006,"NOW BRITAIN'S STRONG - LET'S MAKE IT GREAT TO LIVE IN  PART I: THE BRITAIN WE WANT  PART II: EIGHT MAIN TASKS  1. A Strong Economy  2. Prosperity in the Regions  3. Better Communications  4. Education and Social Equality  5. A Great Place to Live  6. Caring for People  7. A More Active Democracy  8. Britain in the World Community  NOW BRITAIN'S STRONG -LET'S MAKE IT GREAT TO LIVE IN  The British people took a historic decision in 1964 and 1966. It was not two decisions but one decision.  On Thursday, 18 June, many more of the same people - together with millions who have never had a chance of voting before - can take this decision a big stage further. For it takes more than six years to modernise and humanise an advanced industrial country and move it on towards a new kind of greatness.  Part 1: The Britain We Want  OUR PURPOSE is to create, on the firm base of a steadily growing economy, a better society for all the people of Britain: a strong, just and compassionate society, one where the handling of complex problems may be a source of pride to ourselves and an example to the world.  Our appeal is to those who have faith in the capacity and humanity of their fellow-men, and to those who are not solely moved by the search for profit or the hope of personal gain.  First, we believe that Britain's potential for improvement is enormous. Science, technology and the general growth of knowledge present great opportunities for social and economic advance. With foresight, intelligence and effort - with planning - we can harness the new technologies and the powerful economic forces of our time to human ends.  But, without planning, with a return to the Tory free-for-all, people become the victims of economic forces they cannot control.  Second, we believe that the contribution that ordinary people can make to our present welfare and national future is still largely untapped and undeveloped. People want more responsibility. It is this that makes us wish to extend opportunities for everyone to have a bigger say in making decisions, whether in their local community or in their place of work. It is this, too, that makes us place the highest priority on education and educational reform.  These are not the aims of the Tory Party. They have always defended the power and privileges of the few.  Third, we believe that society can now afford and must be ready to meet the basic needs of all its members. There should be decent housing for everyone; slums and overcrowding must be dealt with; immigrant ghettoes must not be allowed to develop. There should be work for those who seek it, in the nation as a whole and in every region.  We must make a rising standard of provision for those who, on account of age, sickness or other circumstances, are unable to provide for themselves. A compassionate society is one that does not grudge help for those in need.  We reject the Tory view that misfortune is a private, not a social, concern, that medical care should depend on what people can pay rather than on what people require and that social expenditure should be ruthlessly pruned.  Fourth, we believe that all people are entitled to be treated as equals: that women should have the same opportunities and rewards as men. We insist, too, that society should not discriminate against minorities on grounds of religion or race or colour: that all should have equal protection under the law and equal opportunity for advancement in and service to the community.  Many of our opponents believe this, too, but today as often in the past the extension of human rights has had to wait for a Labour Government. Fifth, we believe that we have a duty to the future; to ensure that the Britain we leave to the generation that follows is not spoilt by our misuse  or neglect of the environment. We are still dealing with the slums, slag-heaps, derelict land and foul rivers of the first industrial revolution. Today we have to manage our own lives in a new industrial society so that we do not spoil our land, our water, our beaches - even the air we breathe - with noise, fumes, filth and waste.  This will only be done by a Party which is not the creature of private profit.  Sixth, we are proud of the contribution that Britain and its people have made and are making to the welfare of mankind. With our resources, our experience and our unique connections, we have a large and continuing part to play in solving world problems.  The Tories still see their role primarily in terms of overseas bases and a costly and out-of-date type of military presence in the Far East. We see our role primarily in helping the poorer countries to develop and in the stand we take on basic issues of colour and race, while maintaining as loyal members of the U.N. a general defence capability based on Europe but ready and trained for international peace-keeping operations elsewhere.  We believe our defence effort should now be concentrated inside Europe, contributing to collective security through NATO and to the constant search for East-West détente and real European security. We shall play our full part in creating a more secure, prosperous and united Europe.  The Britain we want is one we shall have to build together. It will not be easy to achieve; but our deeply rooted democracy, our tradition of tolerance and fairness, our confidence in ourselves, are enormous assets on which we can draw.  But it is a far more attractive society, with a far greater potential for human happiness, than the selfish, cold, ruthlessly competitive model that our opponents want.  Part 2: Eight Main Tasks  Our jobs, our living standards, and the role of Britain in the World all depend on our ability to earn our living as a nation. That is why Britain has to pay her way in trade and transactions with the outside world.  In the last financial year, 1969/70, our national surplus was £550 million - the largest we have ever had.  Only five years ago, the outgoing Tory Government left the largest deficit ever recorded in our history - running at MINUS £800M. and this was only the culminating year of a long period of economic decline. So in just five years, Labour has registered an improvement of more than £1,300M.  We have got out of the red in our national accounts. We are now strong and solvent and we intend to remain so.  It is particularly important to have this strength in the dangerous world which confronts us today. No one can look beyond our shores and say with certainty there are no storms ahead; but we can now face them from a much better base than in the years of balance of payments weakness.  1. A Strong Economy  Provided that we continue with measures to strengthen the economy and provided that we do not return to the do-nothing complacency of the Tory years, we have good prospects for maintaining our new competitiveness and of keeping our economy in surplus.  It remains, of course, an essential task of economic management to ensure that a substantial part of our output is available for exports - and is not absorbed by excessive home consumption. It is equally the task of economic management to see to it that the correct balance is struck between private and public spending and the need for investment in industry.  The irresponsible tax bribes that the Tories now promise - and threaten - would wreck the economy. These crude electoral manoeuvres would cause raging inflation; be a recipe for economic disaster - or a signal for savage cuts in essential social services.  Steady Expansion  Our central aim is a steady and sustained increase of output with secure and rising employment - and the avoidance of the violent stop-go cycles that have done so much damage to our economy in past years.  Since the number of people of working age in Britain will not increase for a number of years the rate of economic expansion and the increase in our standard of living will depend on productivity: and getting more output from the same number of people.  The factors which will affect productivity most are the quality of management; the skills and performance of people at work; the quality of the plant and equipment that they use; and the organisation and structure of British industry.  (A) INVESTMENT IN INDUSTRY  Expenditure on new plant and equipment in industry has been higher in every year since 1964 than in the peak year of Tory rule. While we have done well by our own past standards, investment in much of British industry is still insufficient in relation to our main competitors. We shall therefore continue to encourage industrial investment in the years ahead.  In the public sector large but essential investment programmes are being carried out in the railways, the national air-lines, the telecommunications industries, in the rapid exploitation of North Sea gas and in the supply of electricity.  (B) PEOPLE AND JOBS  If Britain is to develop her full potential, we must recognise that men and women are even more important than the machines they use. As our industrial structure changes we must see that workers are not left stranded by technological change. We must help them to acquire the skills they need to man the new industries; offer them a wider choice of job opportunity.  This is why the Labour Government has been reorganising and re-equipping our employment services, moving in swiftly to deal with redundancies, placing workers more quickly in employment with the help of modern techniques.  This is why we have carried out the biggest expansion of industrial training in Britain's history. Over 1,400,000 people are now being trained, including 500,000 apprentices.  The main responsibility lies with the Industrial Training Boards, of which 28 have now been established, covering 15m.workpeople. But the G.T.C.s have a vital role to play helping to meet urgent shortages of skilled labour and to retrain redundant workers for new jobs, particularly in the development areas.  Labour has increased the number of centres from 26 to 45 with more to come. As part of their economy drive in 1962-3, the Tories actually CLOSED TWO CENTRES DOWN.  The Government has now set on foot plans to create a National Manpower Service as a modern instrument of manpower intelligence, the forward planning of our manpower needs and the creation of greater job opportunities. The Central Training Council is also being given a more important role in co-ordinating industrial training over the whole field.  (C) INDUSTRIAL REORGANISATION AND PLANNING  Industrial reorganisation, with its emphasis on better management, is crucial to the success - even to the survival - of much of British industry.  We must continue to tackle on an industry basis, and where necessary firm by firm, the more detailed problems of structure which exist in both public and private industry. We shall strengthen the direct relations between the trade unions and Government in industrial policy matters.  Industry - whether private or public - must be accountable for its major decisions. Government investment must carry with it an assurance that a real share of any profit accrues to the nation.  Publicly owned industries are playing a key role in our industrial transformation. The reorganisation of transport is well under way and the coal industry has been given the help it has urgently needed in its task of adjusting to rapid change.  We shall continue to assist the coal industry and we shall carry through further reorganisation measures in both the gas and electricity industries.  The old restrictions on the activities of the nationalised industries are being removed. The new Post Office Corporation with its Giro service and data processing facilities, and the Gas Council with its British Hydrocarbon Company are opening up a new and more competitive concept of public enterprise. With new techniques and resources, there is a growing potential for joint action by these industries.  We also stress the contribution that can be made by co-operative enterprise. This is already a large sector in the economy, and operates on democratic criteria which we would like to see extended. The Labour Party is therefore considering the establishment of a Co-operative Development Agency to give added strength to the rationalisation and development of co-operatives.  In the private sector, particular industries are now undergoing far-reaching structural change, following detailed studies and deliberate Government commitment to reform - e.g. nuclear energy, shipbuilding, machine tools and computers.  The Industrial Reorganisation Corporation has been associated with more than 30 mergers, all geared to better structure and more efficient management - and many of them, such as heavy electrical machinery, motor cars and electronics, are in industries which are crucial to our exports. The Corporation has the power, which it has exercised, to take equity shares in the companies it assists.  In the next Parliament, we shall provide additional finance for the I.R.C. We shall further redeploy and reorganise the Government's Research and Development resources in the support of civil industry.  It is our purpose to develop a new relationship with both sides of industry, in which the forward plans of both Government and industry can be increasingly harmonised in the interests of economic growth. In the public and private sectors, industrial enterprises are paying increasing attention to medium and long term planning. In a rapidly changing economy, our plans have to be flexible, but it is of the utmost importance that these processes should develop. It is not private industry but Tory Party doctrine that rejects planning. The Industrial Reorganisation Corporation and the powers of the Industrial Expansion Act are valuable and flexible instruments of public enterprise for furthering industrial policies.  We do not regard public initiative in industry as confined either to total private or total public ownership. Partnership ventures are sometimes a better solution - e.g. the Bus plant sited in the North of England, aluminium smelters, and the Scottish Transport Group.  We shall pursue these principles, based on our determination to see progress in all sectors of the economy. The establishment of a Holding and Development Company to exploit these possibilities, with special regard to regional development needs, may well be necessary.  We shall push ahead with the search for and exploitation of gas and oil under the North Sea, and our new measures to facilitate the development of mineral deposits in Britain.  With continued progress in training, investment, industrial reorganisation, import saving, and planning, we should be able to achieve a faster rate of economic expansion than we have had before. But progress will depend to a very marked extent on the policies pursued and the managerial efficiency of the very large firms - who must be accountable to the community.  It is the Government's intention, therefore, to set up a Commission on Industry and Manpower - merging the N.B.P.I. and the Monopolies Commission - with a special duty to report on costs, prices and efficiency in various industries and to stimulate competition in large and monopolistic firms.  (D) FIGHTING INFLATION  The biggest challenge facing any industrial nation today, is how to expand the economy without pushing up its costs. The answer lies in increasing our productivity.  Only in this way can we keep our lead over our competitors and ensure an improvement in the real standard of life for our people.  Over the last five years, with little help from the Tories, the Labour Government has been hammering this lesson home. The Prices and Incomes Board has done invaluable work in spelling out how wage increases can be paid for by increased productivity and in scrutinising (and, where necessary, rejecting) the case for price increases. Its work will be continued by the Commission on Industry and Manpower.  Devaluation inevitably pushed up prices - as we warned it would do. Even so, as a result of Government vigilance, prices rose much less than they otherwise would have done. If wage increases were now to be linked to increases in production, we should be able to look forward to greater price stability.  The Government has taken a number of steps to encourage this. It has controlled rent increases by law, thus reducing the increases which would otherwise have taken place. It has kept rates down by rate relief for every domestic ratepayer now running at is. 8d. in the pound. The budget was carefully designed to encourage price stability.  The whole Tory economic strategy, by contrast, is based on policies which would push prices up. The Tories would abolish rent control and reduce housing subsidies so rents would rise to astronomical levels; they would abolish Exchequer subsidies to farmers so food prices would rise by an amount which it is impossible to estimate; they would increase taxes on goods and services in order to reduce direct taxes on the better off. Having abolished S.E.T. they would put other, more inflationary taxes in its place. Their whole budget policy would depend upon the deliberate introduction of a value-added tax which would mean a levy of 4s. in the pound on a wide range of essential goods and services so far exempt from tax; children's clothing, fares, coal, gas, electricity, laundries, theatres, sport and so on.  Food prices have been rising. Rising all over the world. But it is generally acknowledged that our food prices are a long way below those of other western countries. Over the last twelve months, the cost of living has risen at a faster rate than in Britain, in Canada, France, Portugal, Ireland, Turkey, Sweden, the United States, Japan and Norway. Under Tory policies, the British people would face the sort of price increases we have seen in these countries.  Under a Labour Government, people and industry will co-operate in a new effort to keep prices down.  (E) FOOD AND FARMING  The importance to the economy of British agriculture is beyond question. Our policies will continue to be devised to the benefit of the farmer as well as the consumer.  We intend, first, to promote an expanding farm industry. This policy is based on the proved system of guaranteed prices and production grants. However, we are continuing to develop arrangements for greater market stability; we have recognised the need for clear long-term objectives; and for the first time have introduced successive long-term programmes for agricultural expansion.  We shall continue all that we are doing to improve life in the rural community.  2. Prosperity in the Regions  We are determined to see that employment, prosperity and opportunity are spread more evenly through the different regions of our country.  The aim of a Labour Government is to keep the country's resources fully used. Britain no longer suffers from mass, long-term unemployment. In some areas there is an acute shortage of labour. Unemployment today is largely a problem of the development and intermediate areas.  That is why a Labour Government has pursued and will pursue a vigorous policy of regional development.  In the long period of Tory rule up to 1964, prosperity ebbed away from large areas of Britain; economic expansion was heavily concentrated in the Midlands and the South.  The areas where the older basic industries were declining - Scotland, Wales, the North, the North West, and the far South West - suffered continued high unemployment coupled with the loss of many of their young people as they moved to the South in search of work. The areas of expansion in the Midlands and the South East suffered from ever-increasing congestion, with acute shortages of housing and land.  The pace of industrial change has quickened; one industry alone, the coal industry, has lost 300,000 jobs in the past five years. Without a massive development of regional planning, large parts of our country would be economic disaster areas today.  It is here, in the least prosperous regions, that the human impact of technological change is most keenly felt. And it is here that we have tried hardest 40 protect the families and communities from this impact. It is here that we have insisted on the longest possible advance warning of impending change; it is here that we have intervened in shipbuilding to save jobs, as in the coal mines to defer closures. It is here that redundancy payments and earnings-related pensions are of the greatest value. And it is here, too, that we are obliged to bring new work and new opportunity.  But regional planning has been massively developed and for the first time, over the whole of Britain. Through its regional planning machinery, the Government has constructed an increasingly clear and detailed picture of the economic situation in the different areas of Britain. The Government is therefore able to plan ahead to meet the need for new jobs in different parts of the country.  We have defined with increasing accuracy, first the Development Areas, then the Special Development Areas, and, most recently, the New Intermediate Areas. These are all areas that need, in different degrees of urgency, assistance in the supply of new jobs.  Firms wishing to build new factories and offices in areas where work is already plentiful have been stringently controlled through the industrial and office location machinery. At the same time Industrial Development Certificates have been freely issued to firms wishing to expand in areas of high unemployment. But controls, though essential, are not enough. Where serious economic disadvantages arose for firms operating in the development areas, many kinds of special assistance were granted: investment grants at double the national rate; regional employment premium at 30s. a week per man employed; modern factories built for rent by them and in advance of their needs.  The special development areas - those where the coal industry is declining - receive additional aid to help meet running costs and factory rentals.  Public enterprise also plays an important part in regional development and this we mean to extend.  In the intermediate areas, which have important problems of their own, assistance is now being given through freely granted Industrial Development Certificates and also through advanced factories and training grants. These measures are recent and we shall keep a close watch on their effectiveness, with a constant review of their impact and of the areas they cover.  Now the Tories have singled out regional policy for major cuts in public expenditure. They have pledged themselves to end the regional employment premium and they have also committed themselves to scrap investment grants. But without these important financial aids, the supply of industry to the areas of need would be greatly reduced.  We intend to continue with our regional policies so long as they are needed. We shall seek new ways to make them more effective. In particular, we shall try to ensure that office location plays a bigger part in regional development, and stop speculative office building and end the situation where offices in congested areas are left empty, while developers negotiate extortionate rents. We shall be ready to extend assistance to other areas of the country that may be hard hit by industrial change.  3. Better Communications  A modern transport system in which people and goods can move quickly, cheaply and safely throughout the country is an essential national requirement. Under the Tories, road and rail were totally uncoordinated; road building was allowed to fall far behind the growth of road vehicles; our docks and ports were neglected; the development of air services had little purpose beyond the barely concealed desire to weaken the national airlines BEA and BOAC.  The Labour Government is now engaged in a major and planned programme for expanding and modernising our whole transport system.  (I) THE ROAD PROGRAMME  Six years ago less than 300 miles of motorway were open and only 130 miles were being built. In March, 1970, 650 miles of motorway were open to traffic and nearly 400 miles under construction. Expenditure on roads generally has been doubled.  The target of 1,000 miles of motorway in England and Wales will be completed by the end of 1972. The road programme will be further extended as we embark upon the recently announced inter-urban road programme which will double the capacity of the trunk road system by the end of the 1980s. Altogether by the end of that period there will be some 6,000 miles of motorway and new and improved roads open to traffic.  (II) ROAD SAFETY  We must cut down on the number of road casualties. In the last five years while the number of vehicles on the road has risen by a quarter, the number of people killed and seriously injured has been substantially reduced. This welcome development follows on a series of measures we have introduced, including much more stringent control over the mechanical safety of road vehicles. But it reflects most of all the controversial - and courageous - Road Safety Act of 1967 which greatly checked the menace of drunken driving by introducing the breathalyser test.  Our efforts to reduce road casualties will continue.  (III) RAIL AND ROAD  To cut out the old and wasteful competition between road and rail we have established the new National Freight Corporation. Through the liner train and container services our aim is to develop a first rate integrated public service for freight and relieve the increasing pressure upon the roads by switching goods on to our under-used rail system.  At the same time, we intend to improve further the speed and comfort of rail passenger services by investing in modernisation of track and in new rolling stock.  (IV) THE PORTS  In the next Parliament, we shall complete the programme for change in our ports and docks on which we are now advanced. We shall bring the nation's major ports under a National Port Authority to which new local port authorities will be responsible. We shall give each port authority the power to take over and reorganize the principal dock activities within its port area. We shall give workers' representatives more say in the way in which ports are run.  Already we have ended the system of casual labour in the docks and we have greatly improved amenities and pay. Further, a large programme for modernising our docks is under way aimed at providing new deep water berths and modern methods of cargo handling. Investment in the ports has risen from £18m. in 1964 to £50m. in 1969.  But we are convinced, given its history, its problems and its special circumstances, that only a major reorganisation under new and responsible public authorities, will make it possible to overcome the deep-seated problems of this industry.  (V) AIR SERVICES  It is our aim to develop our national airways so that they can handle the increasing growth of air traffic and compete successfully with other national airlines.  We propose to set up an Airways Board to ensure that the fleets of BOAC and BEA are planned together to get the best overall advantage. We shall also seek to establish a strong regional airline, able to provide regular services between the different parts of the United Kingdom.  4. Education and Social Equality  Britain is now spending more on education than ever before. This has brought improvements in the quality of education - more teachers and better schools - and the rapid enlargement of opportunity in our secondary schools, our colleges of education and in higher education as a whole.  This increased expenditure reflects our belief - that all children can benefit from a broader and deeper education; that the rich variety of talent that exists must be given the widest possible chance to develop; and that it will make a major contribution to the welfare, quality and happiness of our society.  Our first priority has been to end the system under which 80 per cent of our nation's children were, at the age of eleven, largely denied the opportunity of a broad secondary education with the chance of higher education beyond.  Comprehensive reorganisation has been vigorously pursued. In the past six years 129 of the 163 English and Welsh local education authorities have agreed plans for reorganising their secondary schools.  This progress must not be checked; it must go forward. We shall legislate to require the minority of Tory education authorities who have so far resisted change to abandon eleven plus selection in England and Wales. We have legislated to end fee-paying in Scotland, and we intend to legislate further to ensure that no local authority in Scotland can maintain an area of privilege which destroys the full benefit of comprehensive reorganisation for its children.  School building has proceeded at a record level; 13 new schools a week have been completed in the first five years of the Labour Government, compared with less than 9 in the last five years of Tory rule.  In the next five years, we shall put more resources, both teachers and building, into the primary schools and expand nursery schools provision both in, and outside, the educational priority areas.  We intend to make further progress, now that the supply of teachers has been increased, towards our aim of reducing to 30 the size of all classes in our schools.  We shall introduce for England and Wales a new Education Bill to replace the 1944 and subsequent Acts. One of our aims will be to bring parents and teachers into a closer partnership in the running of our schools.  In 1972 we shall raise the school leaving age to 16. Preparations for this - increasing the supply of teachers, extending the school building programme, and planning a new course for the extra year - are now well advanced.  We shall still further expand higher education. Already since 1964 the number of young people in full time higher education, including the universities, has almost doubled. We are in transition to a new era where higher education, traditionally the preserve of a small educational elite, could become available to a wider section of the community. This expansion will require very careful planning. We shall undertake an early review of the whole field, including universities, polytechnics, higher further education and the colleges of education.  We have never believed that education and educational opportunity should stop at the school leaving age; nor that further education should be confined to full-time students in colleges and universities.  The capacity of people to learn and their desire to learn continues at all ages. It is, therefore, essential that provisions should be made for people, for adults of all ages, to re-enter the education system. To provide such an opportunity for those who have missed higher education, we have created the Open University, which will commence next year, with 25,000 students - almost half the annual intake of all our other universities together.  SOCIAL EQUALITY  The widening and extension of education is the best preparation that we can make for our people and our country for the world of tomorrow. Investment in people is also the best way of developing a society based on tolerance, co-operation and greater social equality.  The education system itself must not perpetuate educational and social inequalities; that is one reason why full integration of secondary education is essential.  But progress in the field of education must be accompanied by measures to deal with social and economic inequalities elsewhere.  Until Labour came to power, those living off capital gains or land profits were allowed to substantially escape the net of taxation. We have dealt with this, and similar problems, through the Capital Gains Tax, Land Levy, Expense Accounts, Gaming Levy and by removing some loopholes in covenants and in Estate Duty. We shall continue to close loopholes.  There is much more to do to achieve a fairer distribution of wealth in our community. A Labour Government will continue its work to create a fairer tax system: we shall ensure that tax burdens are progressively eased from those least able to bear them and that there is a greater contribution to the National Revenue from the rich.  5. A Great Place to Live  For far too long Britain has been, side by side, two nations - one, in the better suburbs of our major cities and elsewhere, where good housing, access to the countryside, expensive amenities, clean air and leisure facilities were taken for granted; the other, in our city centres and industrial areas, where slum housing, 19th century schools and hospitals, congested services and general lack of amenities are still widespread.  The ways which we have chosen to deal with these problems of improving life - through community spending and the planned allocation of resources - are anathema to the whole philosophy of Toryism. Even today, when Britain is so obviously becoming a better place to live in, they are committed to slashing housing subsidies, cutting public expenditure, and relaxing laws which govern land use.  HOUSING  Housing has been and will continue to be a main priority of Labour's social policy. Rachmanism was dealt with in 1964 by legislation which brought protection from eviction and harassment. The disastrous free-market in rents was abolished by the 1965 Rent Act. A new and more generous system of housing subsidies has made possible a major increase in council building and many families have been helped with house purchasing, especially by favourable mortgage rates under our Option Scheme.  Substantial progress has been made. In our first five years we have built 2,000,000 new homes. In their last five years of office the Tories built 1,600,000. Not only have we increased the number, but we have insisted upon marked improvements in housing standards, in both public and private sectors.  Private landlord rents in unfurnished homes are determined under the 'fair rents' machinery and all tenants have been protected. Rent increases in the public sector are limited. Labour introduced legislation; the Tories opposed it.  New and more generous grants have been provided under the 1969 Act both to prevent the decay of older houses through neglect and to give their occupants modern amenities. This will be of particular value in the so-called twilight areas of our large cities.  The scandal of a leaseholder losing his home without compensation has been ended by our Enfranchisement Act. One million leaseholders have been granted this right.  THE NEXT STAGE  But although much has been done Britain still has - particularly in the great conurbations - a major housing problem. A high level of building must continue, and while shortages exist, rent control policies must remain. There is no place for saving money on the nation's housing.  As a direct result of decisions by Tory councils, there has been a fall in the number of houses completed. It is essential that this short-term trend in house-building be reversed, and we shall take whatever steps are necessary, including the provision of credit, to ensure this.  Home ownershlp will be further encouraged. For the first time in our history, 50 per cent of the nation's homes are now owner-occupied. We believe that this proportion will rise and should continue to rise.  Exceptionally high rates of interest throughout the world are keeping borrowing rates in Britain high - and although local authority lending has been greatly increased - to £155m. this year - and although with the help of Save As You Earn the flow of money to our building societies is now adequate, high lending rates are a serious obstacle to would-be owner-occupiers.  We shall, therefore, in discussion with the building societies, work out new ways of extending home ownership; in particular we shall seek to reduce the amount that has to be paid in the initial deposit; through local authorities and in consultation with Building Societies we shall extend the system of 100 per cent mortgages, and seek to lighten the burden of repayment in the first few years of occupation. As interest rates generally turn down, we shall expect the building societies to follow suit.  Finally, we shall see to it that the 'fair rents' machinery which now operates in unfurnished private dwellings is extended to furnished rented homes.  URBAN PRIORITY AREAS  The worst of our housing problem exists in the inner areas of our large cities. But, serious as slums and overcrowding are, the problems in these areas are not just confined to housing. It is here, for example, that many of our remaining 7,000 pre-1870 schools are located; it is here that many immigrants settle; by and large it is the oldest urban areas where greatest shortages exist in social resources of all kinds.  The Labour Government has introduced new policies to meet this problem:  1. HOUSING PRIORITY AREAS: All these areas of special need are within housing priority areas which will continue to receive special help in house building.  2. EDUCATIONAL PRIORITY AREAS: Over £30m. extra expenditure on school building is being concentrated in areas with the worst slum schools.  3. URBAN PROGRAMME: £25m. is being spent on an Urban Programme covering about 100 separate local authorities, including the provision of nursery schools and facilities for the under-fives.  Financial aid has also been given to voluntary agencies such as housing associations, which have a valuable role to play, particularly in renewing old houses.  The £25m. allocated to the Urban Programme will be spent by 1972. The Government will then extend the programme and increase the amount. In the years 1972/6 a new programme costing up to a further £40m. will be carried out.  Even with Labour's new high levels of expenditure on housing and welfare, hospitals, and social services generally, the areas of greatest social need will lag behind for many years to come.  That is why we intend now to develop the programmes mentioned above and to extend the principle of Priority Areas into spending on other services, so that we focus ADDITIONAL resources on areas with the greatest problems. We shall discuss with Local Authorities whether additional machinery - an Urban Renewal Agency, with powers and functions similar to those of a new town corporation - is required. This will be one of the important parts of our campaign against poverty.  NEW TOWNS  The development of existing English new towns is continuing in Lancashire, the Midlands, the North East and the Home Counties, and we are forging ahead with new towns in Peterborough, Northampton, Warrington, Milton Keynes and central Lancashire. In Wales progress is being made with expansion at Cwmbran and Newtown, and surveys at Llantrisant. Glasgow overspill problems are being tackled by special projects at Erskine and in Lanarkshire and another New Town at Irvine.  Studies will shortly be completed of the potential of Humberside, Severnside, Deeside and Tayside as major new centres should future population growth require them.  OPPORTUNITIES FOR LEISURE  Leisure, and the opportunities to pursue a wide range of recreational and cultural activities, must not be limited by lack of facilities.  Labour's commitment to developing opportunities for leisure has therefore been immense:  1. THE ARTS: Our aim is to make sure that enjoyment of the arts is not something remote from everyday life or removed from the realities of home and work. Government spending on the arts has been more than DOUBLED. Local arts centres, regional film theatres, municipally owned and aided theatres, national and local museums have been established or modernised. A National Theatre and National Film School, after decades of Tory delay, are now being established.  2. SPORT: Labour's National Sports Council and the nine Regional Sports Councils are developing facilities and identifying recreational needs in sport. The next step is to assist in the establishment of regional sports centres. We shall encourage the design of new schools so that they can also serve as multi-purpose sports centres for the adult community. 200 schools are already being designed for this purpose. We shall seek to cater for the growth sports, golfing, squash, sailing and so on. Angling is one of our most popular sports and we shall give special attention to its two great problems of greater access to fishing waters and to the prevention of pollution.  3. COUNTRYSIDE: The Countryside Commissions have wide powers to encourage and aid the provision of Country Parks and general amenities and facilities. One important development from this legislation has been the opening of eleven long-distance footpath routes - the most famous being the Pennine Way.  4. TOURISM: Every year more and more tourists from overseas are finding Britain a vital and interesting place to visit. Our historic cities are a major attraction, and the Labour Government has initiated studies in the conservation of the ancient centres of these cities.  NEW LOCAL AUTHORITIES  We shall carry through in the next Parliament a major reorganisation of local government. Strong units of local government will make possible much more effective town and country planning.  Reform of local gov6rnment finance will also be necessary. Urgent action has already been taken to deal with the worst features of the rating system. Rate rebates are now helping nearly one million families. We propose to invite, through the publication of a Green Paper, widespread debate of future changes in local taxation.  A CLEANER BRITAIN  These, then, are Labour's priorities in making Britain a better place to live; Housing, New Towns, Urban Renewal and opportunities for varied  and stimulating leisure pursuits. We must take far better care of our physical environment. This means considerable attention to clean air, waste disposal, industrial effluents, the coastline, dereliction, noise, pesticides and all other problems of pollution - no matter how they arise.  Already we have made progress in clearing derelict land.' The acreage cleared has risen from 151 in 1964 to 1,324 last year. It is our aim now to raise - the £2m. expenditure programme of last year to £6m. by 1974.  Second, we are tackling the increasing problem of oil pollution. We shall legislate to ratify the new international agreement on discharges at sea and increase penalties against ships that break it.  Third, we shall take further steps to reduce aircraft noise. We have already approved an aircraft noise certification scheme that will cut the permitted noise levels of all new sub-sonic airliners.  Fourth, we shall legislate for effective control over the use of pesticides. Fifth, we shall protect our rivers and our coasts with new measures of control over industrial and human effluence.  There is an immense amount of work that needs to be done if we are to deal effectively with this problem.  The central premise in Labour's approach to these problems is to accept that community responsibility is essential if the quality of life is to be enhanced. We believe that Tory philosophy - with its emphasis on private interests and its opposition to collective organisation - is quite incapable of dealing with the problems which will increasingly arise.  6. Caring for People  The greatest single achievement of the post-war Labour Government was its creation of the best universal social security system and the first comprehensive health service in the world. The greatest single condemnation of Tory rule was the appalling neglect of this social programme.  They left a desperate need for new investment and a considerable shortage of staff. Hospital building was virtually neglected for the first ten years of Tory Government. They cut the number of doctors in training and they imposed a freeze on nurses' pay. The flat-rate national insurance contribution imposed a regressive poll-tax on the lower-paid. Worst of all, no fundamental proposals were made to abolish poverty in old age.  Labour's programme of action has therefore been as follows:  A substantial rise in all benefits.  More money for buildings and trained staff.  Structural reform of the old system.  Since the last full Tory year spending on health and social security is up over 70 per cent; wage-related short-term benefits and redundancy payments have been introduced; a tremendous programme of hospital building is under way, and a far-reaching Plan for National Superannuation has been incorporated in a Bill.  BENEFITS  Three increases - the last in November 1969 - have substantially raised the real level of retirement pensions. The earnings rule has been relaxed - and for widows abolished. Sickness, unemployment, and other benefits have been increased in line with pensions, and redundancy pay and earnings-related short-term benefits begun.  The old National Assistance Board has been abolished. A more open and humane Supplementary Benefits Commission provides entitlement as a right. Three times the number of old people are now living independent lives in flats of their own, with a warden on call; over 500 more old people's homes have been built; and meals on wheels doubled.  Benefits for children have had a high priority. For the last eight Tory years, no increases in family allowances were made. Labour has twice raised these allowances - the value is now more than double - and has concentrated the benefit on the poorer family by balancing tax allowances and cash benefits.  HEALTH SERVICES  Expenditure on hospital building has been more than doubled. Five times as many health centres are now open. Local health and welfare expenditure as a whole is now running at three times the level of just ten years ago.  The National Health Service will be developed by continued expansion of training of doctors, nurses and other staff, by our great building programme, and by changes in the administrative structure to bring unified Local Health Authorities.  THE NEXT STEPS  1. THE NEW PENSIONS PLAN  The present national insurance scheme, in spite of the improvements which Labour has made, cannot provide an adequate income for retirement. Flat-rate contribution and benefits must inevitably be geared to the ability of the lowest paid to enter into the insurance contract. As a result, those on average and above average pay would always find a steep drop in their means upon retirement.  Labour's new Pension Plan will, therefore, incorporate radical concepts in social security; earnings-related contributions will mean a reduction for millions of lower paid workers. Benefits will be calculated in such a way as to assist the industrial worker and the below-average earner; there will be PARTNERSHIP with private occupational schemes, through which many will want to add to their state pension; full equality for women; a widow will receive the whole of her husband's pension; widows' pensions will be paid at 40; women will receive earnings-related sickness and unemployment benefit.  Labour's scheme is designed to abolish poverty in old age by enabling every worker to qualify for a pension at a level where supplementary benefit is no longer required. The wealth of the nation is increasing and those least able to care for themselves - the aged, the sick, unemployed and the widow - have a right to share in rising prosperity, and satisfy rising expectation. The Tories were the first to misrepresent the scheme. Now they are pledged to destroy it.  2. DISABLED  As part of the new Act, we shall develop a new deal for the long-term sick and disabled. There will be an earnings-related invalidity benefit, and a constant attendance allowance for the very severely disabled, which for the first time covers the non-earner, the wife and children.  3. FAMILY POVERTY  There is a continuing problem of poverty in low income families - a many-sided problem of low wage industries, of disability and of special difficulties. On all of these the Labour Government has acted to help, and we will take steps to provide further social support. In the last two budgets we have taken three million on low incomes out of taxation.  We shall review the present system of family allowances and income tax child allowances.  On the special problem of the single-parent family, the Government has set up a comprehensive study under the Finer Committee.  4. HEALTH SERVICE  We need to concentrate more resources m the health service on the needs of the mentally handicapped, the mentally ill and elderly sick. Long stay hospitals, particularly those for the mentally handicapped, have for far too long been subjected to gross under-staffing and overcrowding, many of them in obsolete buildings.  We have already dealt with some of the worst features of this social scandal and have worked out our plans for providing to those long stay patients for whom there is small chance of cure, the care they deserve.  The new unitary structure of the health service and its close co-operation with the new local authorities will help to ensure more effective joint planning of hostels and homes and a better deployment of nurses and other staffs.  7. A More Active Democracy  Strong economic policy and care and compassion in the social field must be accompanied by a new drive both to infuse a democratic element into the increasingly complex institutions which dominate our lives and to give added protection and safeguards to the rights of individuals.  The priorities are clear. We have to make existing democratic institutions more effective and we have to extend the democratic principle, in various forms, into those institutions where democracy itself is still a stranger.  The machinery of government itself must be adapted to meet new demands and democratic procedures must be extended into industry and the social services.  CENTRAL GOVERNMENT AND PARLIAMENT  Labour has begun the process of reform at the very heart of public decision making - central government itself. Archaic House of Commons procedures have been swept away, specialist Select Committees set up, and greatly improved research and information facilities to help M.P.s work more effectively.  The Government has introduced the instrument of the Green Paper to allow wide public debate and consultation on public issues before the crucial decisions are taken.  Under a Labour Government young people have been given full civil rights - including the right to vote at 18.  Following the publication of the Fulton Report, reform of the Civil Service is now going ahead. Our purpose is to achieve a broader base for recruitment, more specialist skills, the abolition of the class structure, and greater mobility between various branches of the service and with outside occupations.  An Ombudsman was appointed in 1968 to investigate the citizens' complaints against Government Departments. This office has already proved its value, and we now intend to extend the principle to local government and to the health service.  We cannot accept the situation in which the House of Lords can nullify important decisions of the House of Commons and, with its delaying powers, veto measures in the last year before an election. Proposals to secure reform will therefore be brought forward.  DEVOLUTION  In 1965 the Labour Government set up for the first time Economic Planning Councils and Planning Boards for Wales, Scotland and the eight new planning regions of England. These have proved to be effective instruments to strengthen the Government's regional policies, and have given new impetus to proposals for devolution. The Government therefore set up a Commission on the Constitution which is now examining and receiving evidence on these issues.  WALES  In Wales the Labour Government in 1964 set up the Welsh Office with the Secretary of State a member of the Cabinet. The responsibilities of the Welsh Office have recently been substantially increased.  The Government has published proposals for a new local authority structure to provide improved local services. The evidence given by the Labour Party to the Commission on the Constitution includes plans for an elected council for Wales with extended powers. The Labour Party in Wales believes strongly in the integration of the United Kingdom and rejects a policy of separatism or a separate Parliament for Wales as being detrimental to the true interests of the Principality.  The Welsh Language Act 1967 has given a new impetus to the use of Welsh in public affairs. The Government will continue to encourage the growth of Welsh or bilingual schools throughout Wales. Through its financial support for the publication of books in Welsh for adults and through the expanding services of the Welsh Arts Council, the Labour Government will continue its efforts to support Welsh culture.  In its economic life, Wales has benefited significantly from the Government's policy which has attracted more than 150 new firms to  Wales since 1964, which has secured for Wales the largest ever trunk road programme and the highest number of houses ever built, which has halted depopulation in Mid-Wales, has fostered the tourist industry and has for the first time really tackled the problem of derelict land.  SCOTLAND  The Labour Party in Scotland his welcomed any changes leading to more effective Government which do not destroy the integration of the U.K. or weaken Scotland's influence at Westminster. They too reject separatism and also any separate legislative assembly.  Since 1964 Labour's separate legislation for Scotland has been accepted by the U.K. Parliament  - The Highlands and Islands Development Board  - The Countryside Commission  - The General Teaching Council  - The Social Work Act  - The First Stage of Feudal Tenure reform  - Security for Tenant Farmers, etc.  Much of that legislation has led the way for the rest of the country.  We shall now further these aims in our proposals for local government reform based upon Wheatley. We shall complete our work of abolishing and replacing the feudal system of land tenure. And we shall apply Scottish solutions to Scottish problems.  NORTHERN IRELAND  Northern Ireland presents major problems. Fifty years of one-party Tory rule have led to social tensions and lack of opportunities which erupted into major disorders last summer. The Government has helped stabilise the situation and has insisted on reforms being carried out in Northern Ireland based on the practice and principle of nondiscrimination. In particular, it has been agreed that the reform of local government in Ulster shall proceed and that a Central Housing Authority shall be set up. British troops will remain in Northern Ireland so long as they are needed.  The Downing St. Declaration of 19th August, 1969 signed by the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, and the Prime Minister of Northern Ireland, reaffirmed that in all legislation and executive decisions of Government every citizen of Northern Ireland is entitled to the same equality of treatment and freedom from discrimination as obtains in the rest of the United Kingdom, irrespective of political views or religion.  LOCAL GOVERNMENT  We believe that the recent reports on local government present a great opportunity for the transfer of administrative power from Westminster to the localities. Larger and stronger local authorities will mean better planning, more efficiency, stronger councils and improved quality in local democracy and local services.  Legislation will be brought forward in the next Parliament to set up new authorities, to abolish the post of alderman and to give added power to elected representatives. We shall also encourage the setting up of Local Councils to give people a greater say in local problems.  HEALTH SERVICE  Hand in hand with the reform of local government we propose a new administrative structure for the Health Service. We shall bring together the now separate hospital service, the general practitioner service and the local authority health services. The old tripartite structure will go, and be replaced by area Health Authorities which will allow for greater involvement in its administration of local representatives and those who operate the service.  SCHOOLS  The Government's major White Paper on Education will include proposals to involve parents, teachers and the wider community more directly in the management of the education system.  INDUSTRIAL DEMOCRACY  But political democracy is of limited value unless it is underpinned by industrial democracy. If we are to have greater industrial harmony, we must involve the worker through his union more closely in the decisions which affect his working life and eliminate the grievances that are the causes of many strikes.  That is why Labour has produced a charter of good industrial relations on which it intends to legislate.  This will:  - Overhaul negotiating and disputes procedures  - Give safeguards against unfair dismissal  - Make recognition a legal right for trade unions  - Ensure greater disclosure of information to workers' representatives  - Encourage the rationalisation of trade union structures  - Enable unions and employers to negotiate legally binding agreements where they expressly indicate their desire to do so.  Britain's publicly owned industries are already experimenting in new worker/manager relationships and new ways of securing workers' representation on their boards of management. A Labour Government will encourage similar experiments in private industry.  We shall also consider further the structure of the limited liability company with a view to making it more accountable to its employees and the community.  LAW AND JUSTICE  It is a first duty of government to protect the citizen against violence, intimidation and crime. The Government will vigorously pursue the fight against vandals and law breakers. But the campaign for law and order must be linked to liberty and justice in a civilised society. Nothing could be more cynical than the current attempts by our opponents to exploit for Party political ends the issue of crime and law enforcement.  CRIME  The streets of our cities are as safe today as those in any throughout the world. They must remain so. Labour has reorganised the police forces in this country and a record sum is being spent on equipment. The number of police is higher than ever before. The Gaming Act of 1968 purged gambling of its criminal elements, cut excessive profits, and checked the proliferation of gaming machines.  Equally important are our achievements in obtaining penal reform, in transforming our approach to the young offender, in democratising the magistrates' bench, and in our approach to rehabilitating the prisoner. This is an exceedingly difficult task while so many of our prisons are a century old and are gravely overcrowded; but it must be persisted in patiently, not only for the sake of the prisoner himself, but because his return to a decent way of life and to productive work obviously benefits society as a whole.  LAW REFORM  Britain's system of justice is renowned throughout the world, but many of our laws need up-dating and the administration of justice is severely over-stretched. Labour's Law Commissions will continue with their work for systematic codification of criminal law, repeal of old Acts, simplification of the statute book and reform of the courts. It is also our aim to enable the courts to handle the increasing volume of work.  ACCESS TO THE LAW  We have recently extended the legal aid scheme and it is our intention to ensure that people with modest means can obtain legal advice and be properly represented in the courts of law.  RACE RELATIONS  With the rate of immigration under firm control and much lower than in past years, we shall be able still more to concentrate our resources in the major task of securing good race relations. The Urban Programme includes help to areas of high immigrant population, where special social needs exist. The Race Relations Act has outlawed incitement to racial hatred and discrimination in housing, employment and credit facilities. The Community Relations Commission, with the local authorities and other voluntary bodies, is dealing with the longer-term problem of community living.  We now propose to review the law relating to citizenship and to give the Race Relations Board powers of discretion in taking up complaints.  BROADCASTING  Broadcasting has a major role to play in an informed democracy.  The greatest danger in communications is the danger of growing concentration of private ownership, and the parallel danger of domination by commercial values. In broadcasting the Government has firmly resisted the commercial lobby's pleas for private radio. A network of local radio stations has instead been created - responsible to the community and co-ordinated by the B.B.C.  The Government has decided to establish a high-powered Committee of Enquiry to report on the Future of Broadcasting, in time for the basic decisions which have to be taken in 1975.  A HEALTHY DEMOCRACY  When individuals have a satisfying and rewarding job, and when they have then satisfied basic needs for food and shelter and a pleasant environment, we believe that many will wish to devote more time and interest to the collective problems of the community. It is this, in recent years, which has led to calls for greater devolution, participation in decision-making and reform of democratic structures.  The proposals we have set out above will ensure a thorough-going reform of government machinery, together with an increase in democratic decision-taking in the community; the school, the hospital and workplace. We believe that this is the reform people wish - an opportunity to influence decisions on those things which interest and affect them most. It calls for a continuing change in the relationship between government and governed, and we gladly accept the challenge of making sure that the reforms go through.  We also want people to assume greater responsibility themselves. The future of this country depends as much on how people use the power they have as on the action government may take.  8. Britain in the World Community  Labour's fundamental and historic changes in Britain's defence and foreign policy have given Britain a more credible and realistic position in world affairs than we ever enjoyed under the last Tory administration. In the last five years Labour has:  - Saved £3,000 million on Tory defence plans  - Planned a further saving of £2,000 million by 1972  - Ended our commitments East of Suez  - Increased our support for the U.N.  - Strengthened the Commonwealth  - Improved Forces pay and conditions  - Given independence to nine former colonies  - Observed the U.N. arms ban on South Africa  - Brought increased support to collective security in Europe and to the search for European détente  - Underlined our desire to play a full part in the future political and economic development of our continent.  PEACE AND SECURITY  The steady work of Labour's Ministers of Disarmament has achieved real progress. They played a large part in securing agreement on the Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty which now, signed and ratified by the required number of nations, has come into force. One consequence of this Treaty has been that America and Russia are now engaged in serious discussion on Strategic Arms Limitation; and all men of good will will wish these talks success.  Labour's Ministers were also active in establishing a Nuclear Free Zone in Latin America. The next tasks - on which Ministers are already at work - are these:  (a) A comprehensive ban on the testing of nuclear weapons  (b) A new international agreement to outlaw biological weapons  (c) An agreement to prevent the depths of the sea from being used for warlike purposes.  In the world as it is today, Britain must maintain her defences and her firm commitment to NATO. It is true - and it is a truly Socialist shift in priorities - that we now spend more on education than on defence, and that in the near future the health and welfare service expenditure will also exceed defence spending. Yet, because of our shrewd and sensible reduction in commitments, with Labour, the armed forces are better paid, better equipped and more effective in NATO than ever before. More than that, in contrast to the hundreds of millions of pounds wasted on costly prestige projects under the Tories, Labour's defence planning gives the taxpayer value for money.  Labour is determined that NATO shall not be merely a defensive alliance: it must work positively for a relaxation of tension and reduction of forces. Some progress is already being made. Herr Willy Brandt, Socialist Chancellor of the Federal Republic of Germany, is engaged in talks with Russia, Poland and East Germany. The British Labour Government fully supports his efforts. Our Government, together with America, France and Russia, is seeking to reduce the occasions for conflict and tension in Berlin.  The Government believes that the members of NATO should work towards a well-prepared conference on European Security, in which balanced reduction of forces and the key problems now creating tension in Europe could be discussed. The Government has just taken a new initiative for multilateral explanatory talks with the Warsaw Pact countries with a view to finding a basis for wide-ranging negotiations on European security and a relaxation of tension.  In two areas - Indo-China and the Middle East - there is bitter conflict, full of danger for the peace of the world. Labour believes that no purely military solution is possible in either of these areas. A lasting settlement in Indo-China must be based on the Geneva agreements and the withdrawal of all foreign troops; a lasting settlement in the Middle East on the British sponsored Security Council resolution of November 1967. It is on these foundations that a Labour Government will work.  THE UNITED NATIONS  Support for the U.N. continues to be the cornerstone of Labour's foreign policy. Britain is the only one of more than 100 member countries which is represented at the U.N. by a senior Minister, with direct access to the Prime Minister. Further examination will be given to the establishing of a permanent U.N. peace-keeping force and further efforts must be made to guarantee the U.N. a firm financial basis.  THE FIGHT AGAINST WORLD POVERTY  The Ministry of Overseas Development, which Labour set up, has meant that aid is better co-ordinated and directed and thus more effective, than ever before. The improved economic climate will enable us to make progress.  In the next five years Labour is to increase our aid programme by about one-third, from £219 millions in 69/70 to £300 millions in 73/74.  Labour will seek to devote 1 per cent of our Gross National Product to aid the developing world by 1975 and to achieve an official flow of aid of 0.7 per cent of GNP during the Second Development Decade - this accepts the target set by the Pearson Commission.  Multilateral agencies will receive a larger proportion of total aid flow and more resources will be devoted to rural and co-operative development and population planning.  RACIAL CONFLICT  The division of the world along racial lines presents a major threat to peace during the coming decade. Nowhere is this more apparent than in Southern Africa, where the odious doctrine of Apartheid continues to flourish.  Official Tory Party policy already commits a future Conservative Government to:  (a) Sell arms to South Africa  (b) Negotiate with the Smith regime on Rhodesia  Labour made every effort possible to bring about an honourable settlement in Rhodesia consistent with the six principles. The illegal Rhodesian regime slammed the door by introducing an Apartheid-type republican constitution. Labour will maintain sanctions against the illegal regime and negotiate no settlement that does not guarantee unimpeded progress to majority rule. A Labour Government will continue to comply with the United Nations ban on arms to South Africa.  THE COMMONWEALTH  In the building of racial harmony and the fight against poverty the Commonwealth can play a unique and expanding role in building bridges between all races, between rich and poor, and help maintain the co-operation and understanding between nations which makes it a force for peace. The Government will encourage and support an expansion of the technical assistance and co-ordinating functions of the Commonwealth Secretariat.  Throughout the sixties Tory journalists and politicians decried the usefulness of the Commonwealth link. With Labour the Commonwealth has been revitalised, with its own secretariat and Secretary General providing a wide range of services and co-ordinating functions for member states.  THE WORLD ECONOMY  Today either the scale of initial investment or the size of market required to ensure viability demands international co-operation for new developments such as space communications or aircraft production.  Through the Ministry of Technology, established by Labour in 1964, such co-operation is fostered not only with the U.S.A. and Western Europe but also with the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe.  In the coming decade we shall develop closer technological relations with India and other countries. Trading and technological links may also play a part in helping to bring China into the community                                                                                                                                                                                                    of nations. Labour still believes that China should be a member.                                                                                                                                                                                                     of the United Nations.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                The pressures put on individual national currencies, the problems                                                                                                                                                                                                    presented by major international companies crossing frontiers                                                                                                                                                                                                        as if they did not exist and transferring know-how and resources                                                                                                                                                                                                     with great ease, the need for international action to tackle problems                                                                                                                                                                                                of our environment such as oil pollution, the need to encourage                                                                                                                                                                                                      a greater volume of world trade, are all problems which can only                                                                                                                                                                                                     be solved by international co-operation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Some of these problems will require world-wide action by agencies                                                                                                                                                                                                    of the United Nations. Others will best be dealt with by 'regional                                                                                                                                                                                                   cooperation.

NA,197006,"What a Life!  There must surely be a better way to run a country than the one we have used for the last twenty-five years. No wonder people are fed up with thirteen years of Tory rule and twelve years under Labour.  What have we achieved? What sort of society have we turned ourselves into materially and culturally?  The purchasing power of the pound today is only worth about 7/- compared with its value in 1945.  Wages keep going up but, owing to rising prices, many people are worse off.  Over 600,000 people are out of work and no one seems to mind. Up to half a million people are without a proper home. In the so-called Welfare State many thousands of disabled people get no help.  Parliament has become a slanging shop.  The precious right of free speech is in peril from hooligan anarchists.  Legitimate protests are regrettably too often the prelude to violence.  Strikes, official and unofficial, by a few, paralyse whole sectors of industry and make it daily more difficult to pay our way in the world.  The big labour unions use their power to take the biggest slice of the national wealth they can. The less powerful and the unorganised are left at the tail end of the pay claim queue. Inefficient monopolies pass on their price increases to the consumer.  The Hospital service is grossly overstrained because junior doctors and nurses are so badly paid.  We are only just waking up to the dangers of pollution and the damage we have done to the environment and the quality of life.  Crime increases at a dangerous rate, too often violent, and the forces of law and order are set an impossible and unnecessary task.  The election system bolsters up ""bigness"". The Big parties have totally unfair advantages against minorities. But the system is unfair even between the major parties.  The whole ""System"" conspires against the individual, the unrepresented and the weak, in favour of the well-organised big battalions, and no one seems to care.  But unless someone does care and does something about it the ""System"" will go on and on. It can only be broken by supporting something different and that something is the Liberal Party.  It may be true that Liberals cannot expect under the present system to jump overnight from a party of thirteen M.P.s and three million supporters to become the government of the day, but we can break the power of the big battalions if we can get a substantial increase in the number of Liberal M.P.s in the next House of Commons and show that enough people care and want to protest at the present political farce.  Politics is about power. It is about the sort of society we want to build and it must be a better one than we have now. Man has political power when he exercises a vote. A party has political power whether in government or opposition in so far as it influences and changes policy. Minority parties have political power when they influence policy or public opinion or successfully stand up against injustices or change the climate of politics.  THE LIBERAL PARTY IS THE PARTY OF POWER FOR THE ORDINARY PEOPLE. IT IS THE PARTY FOR PEOPLE WHO CARE.  The Liberal Party has political power but it needs more members in Parliament and a massive Liberal vote outside to strengthen and broaden that power and to use it to break the Tory/Labour stranglehold and create a really satisfying and worthwhile society to live in.  It is an old adage that he who pays the piper calls the tune. Who pays the Tory piper? In 1968/69 £752,086 was contributed to Tory funds by some 470 companies Who pays the Labour piper? In March the TRADE UNIONS paid £350,000 to Labour's election fund. Big business tycoons and trade union bosses have a powerful say in British politics. We believe that millions of ordinary British people do not want our national politics to be dominated to the exclusion of all else by these two giant interests. Someone must speak for those whom big business and the big trade unions overlook. The Liberal election pledge is this: we will stand up to the big battalions on behalf of these people, where justice so demands. In what follows we show some of the ways in which we will do so.  THE INDIVIDUAL WORKER The individual worker must have a say and a stake in the place where he works. In large-scale industry he is entitled to similar rights to those enjoyed by the shareholder. Industry must become a partnership between capital and labour, with management responsible to the partnership. Workers should participate in the election of directors. Works Councils should be established in every plant. This will facilitate plant-bargaining and productivity deals. It will enable the aim of the Donovan Commission on Trade Unions to be realised by providing the proper machinery for negotiations at plant level between people who know, and are involved in, the local conditions. In this way industrial relations can be greatly improved and the causes of many strikes removed. This state of affairs cannot be brought about by using the power of the law as the Conservatives wish, and as the Labour Government at one time intended. Liberal plans for partnership in industry will give increased opportunities for profit-sharing. This will help to remove the suspicions entertained by labour about capital. Management and labour have to be moulded into one team, not a wrestling match.  THE SHOPPER FACED BY RISING PRICES The Liberals are not dominated by any sectional interest of producers. We are in a particularly strong position to defend the consumer. Stronger measures are needed to deal with monopoly conditions. All mergers over a certain size must go automatically to the Commission for Manpower and Industry. The linking of earnings to productivity is the way to deal with rising prices. Liberal industrial policy is designed to curb inflation. The Commission for Manpower and Industry should devote particular attention to the nationalised industries.  THOSE LIVING IN PARTS REMOTE FROM LONDON Too much power is concentrated in Whitehall and Westminster. Genuine regional government must be established. Liberals propose twelve regional Assemblies in England, exercising many of the powers now exercised at the centre. This will allow the people of a region to have much more control over their own affairs than they have today. Labour has not put forward any proposals for regional government. They have, however, adopted a modified version of the Maud proposals for local government reform. These take local decisions further away from the individual than they are now.  Scotland and Wales are distinct national entities within the United Kingdom. We want them to have their own Parliaments for Scottish and Welsh affairs, united with England by a Federal Parliament. In Northern Ireland Liberals have introduced civil rights legislation only to be defeated by the forces of reaction.  TAXATION REFORM The tax system must be reformed and simplified so that it can be easily understood. There should be a permanent Parliamentary Committee on taxation, equipped to consult with experts, and able to assess foreign systems. We must have a more effective tax on transfers of wealth, through a progressive Gifts and Inheritance Tax. Selective employment tax should be replaced by a regionally variable pay-roll tax.  THE SMALL BUSINESS Very heavy burdens have been placed on the small businesses of this country. In the first three months of 1970, 1,039 companies failed. The equivalent figure for 1969 was 926, and for 1968 it was 762. Bureaucratic chores, selective employment tax, high interest rates, credit squeeze and taxation policies generally are taking their toll of small companies. Yet the smaller businesses are very important. They employ 50 per cent of the total manufacturing labour force and produce at least 42 per cent of the Gross National Product. Twenty-five per cent of all United Kingdom exports are made by several thousand companies in the medium-to small-size categories. It has often been the small firm which has been prepared to take the risks. The Chairman of the British National Council recently said, ""we are minimising the rewards and maximising the risks for small-scale enterprise"". Liberals want to reverse this trend. It is in the national interest to do so.  THE FARMER AND GROWER Agriculture is a major import saver. Yet over the last ten years real incomes have increased by 46 per cent while farmers' real incomes have increased by only 7 per cent. Constant under-recoupment at successive price reviews has brought this situation about. Liberals support the farmers' claim for more generous treatment, We want the present system of deficiency payments continued for all products except beef and cereals. For these we support the import levy system, which will be required if we join the Common Market, Small farmers and growers, who are efficient and whose holdings are viable, deserve to survive. Agricultural policy. must be modified to give agriculture an assured future, and capital for improvements and expansion. Liberals call for the establishment of a Land Bank to provide capital at cheap rates of interest.  THE INDEPENDENT TRADER Even in these days of supermarkets and multiple stores there is still an important role for the independent trader with his tradition of personal service. We do not ask for any privileged position for him but we do demand that he is not discriminated against. Much of what we have already said about the small business also applies to him. In addition we believe it essential that the independent trader should have the same opportunities to secure sites in new development areas as his larger competitor.  THE OLD Pensioners have not the same organised power as those who are still working. The pension is inadequate. An adequate flat-rate pension for today's pensioner is much more important than elaborate schemes, like Mr. Crossman's to provide earnings-related pensions in 1992! We want to move in stages to the position where the pension for a married couple is half average national earnings with a corresponding increase for the single person. Over and above the increased flat-rate pension we want to see special opportunity provided for those without a pension scheme where they work to save for their retirement with assistance from a Central Account financed by a levy on all employers without an adequate occupational scheme. We stand by our support for the principle of parity in public service pensions.  THE YOUNG Children are not a pressure group either. Everyone is agreed that they deserve the best possible start in life. The emphasis should be on the improvement of primary schools and the provision of nursery schools. Secondary education should be non-selective. Age eleven to eighteen comprehensive schools have an important part to play in this. But they are not the only means to a non-selective system. They should not be hastily imposed where the buildings, staff and facilities are not suitable. There should be greater opportunities for further education outside the Universities.  THE LOW-INCOME FAMILIES Five hundred thousand low-income families suffer severe poverty in this country. The system of family benefits must be altered to include one child families. A minimum statutory earnings level is essential.  THE HOMELESS AND THE SLUM-DWELLER The shortage of homes causes misery for many. The continuing existence of city slums is a national disgrace. There must be a very great speed-up in the renovation of whole areas. The housing problem must be tackled on a regional basis. Talk of a surplus of homes in a few years time is nonsense. How many of these ""surplus"" homes will be fit to live in?  THOSE PAYING RENT It is unfair that those who pay rent in the private sector should receive no help from the Government or local authority, whereas those who are buying a house through a mortgage or living in a council house do. Those in private rented accommodation should also be eligible for help.  THE OWNER OCCUPIER The percentage of the population owning their own homes is steadily increasing and Liberals welcome this. We want to see mortgage funds available for older, sound property as well as modern houses, at reasonable rates of interest. Every encouragement must be given to housing associations. Tax on building societies surpluses should be abolished. The obsolete rating system should be entirely reformed.  THE VOTER In order that all the votes cast at an election shall count we wish to reform the voting system by the introduction of proportional representation by the single transferable vote. This system would mean that Parties were represented in the House of Commons in proportion to the votes cast for them in the country. Nearly all voters could point to at least one M.P. whom they had helped to elect. The power of the Party Whips would be diminished. An important result of this reform would be that electors could choose between candidates representing different strands of opinion within the same Party, pro-Powell or anti-Powell Tories, for example, or pro-Common Market or anti-Common Market Labour candidates. Liberals were the first to advocate votes at eighteen.  THE CITIZEN AGAINST THE BUREAUCRAT We have presented to the House of Commons a Bill of Rights which would safeguard the rights of the individual against the State. We shall continue to press for its adoption.  THE CITIZEN AND CRIME The upholding of civil rights is one side of the question of law and order. The other is the prevention of crime. We believe that the two basic causes of the increase in crime are the low detection rate and the fact that for many criminals crime pays. It is essential therefore to strengthen the police. Improvements in pay and conditions are required. Traffic control should be entrusted to a new Traffic Corps. The Courts should be able to adjudicate a convicted person bankrupt. The assets of a criminal could then be made available to repay his ""creditors""; those he has injured or robbed. Shotguns must be controlled as are other weapons.  THE UNITED KINGDOM AND THE WORLD Liberals are determined to stand up for the individual against the big battalions. The need to check the powerful is the theme of Liberal policy at home. World co-operation is the theme of Liberal policy abroad.  The power and influence of the United Nations must be strengthened. The Middle Cast crisis should be settled along the lines of the Security Council resolution of November 1967. The continuance of NATO is essential until a genuine European security agreement takes its place. We look forward to the earliest possible withdrawal of United States forces from Vietnam and we regret the U.S. invasion of Cambodia.  In Western Europe we want the closest possible political unity. We see Britain's joining the Common Market as a part of this unity. The Common Market is an exciting experiment in the pooling of national sovereignty in the economic sphere. It can be the forerunner of a similar unity in foreign policy and defence. Liberals advocated Britain's applying to join at a time when it would have been very much easier than now. The Labour and Conservative Parties would not listen though they both subsequently came round to this point of view when in office. Liberals continue to believe that satisfactory terms can be obtained for British entry. In any event we wish to see the breaking down of barriers to international trade.  Greater freedom in international trade will assist the underdeveloped countries who need markets for their products. We support the principle that in accordance with the Pearson Report Britain and other countries should contribute 1 per cent of Gross National Product of official aid to developing countries as soon as possible.  We are totally opposed to all forms of racial and religious discrimination.  Liberals care! We care for those the big battalions forget. We care for the poor and the oppressed. We care for those whose only crime is that they are not as big or as powerful as their competitors. We care for the citizen at the mercy of the bureaucratic machine. We care for those who feel that government is remote and hostile. We care for those struggling to make ends meet in the face of rising prices. We care for those who have no satisfactory place to live. We care for the old and the young who have no organisation to defend them. We care for those discriminated against on grounds of colour and religion. We care for those striving to raise their countries out of poverty. We care for co-operation between the nations. We care because we are Liberals and because the basic principle of Liberalism is a belief in the supreme value of individual human personality.  WE APPEAL TO LIBERALS TO VOTE LIBERAL whenever there is a Liberal candidate. We appeal to others who sympathise with our views. We appeal to those who are disenchanted with the way things are run by Tories and Labour.  WE APPEAL TO VOTERS NOT TO WASTE THEIR VOTE by piling up majorities behind Conservative and Labour candidates but use the vote positively and usefully to show how many millions of people in this country really care. You can do this by voting Liberal on June the 18th."
"Conservatives",197006,"A Better Tomorrow  FOREWORD  This Manifesto sets out the policies of the Conservative Party for a better Britain. It provides a programme for a Parliament How fast we can go will depend on how difficult a situation we find when we take office.  But good government is not lust a matter of the right policies. It also depends on the way the government is run. This is something which I have thought about deeply. Indeed, it has been one of my main interests since I entered the House of Commons in 1950.  During the last six years we have suffered not only from bad policies, but from a cheap and trivial style of government Decisions have been dictated simply by the desire to catch tomorrow's headlines. The short-term gain has counted for everything; the long-term objective has gone out of the window. Every device has been used to gain immediate publicity, and government by gimmick has become the order of the day. Decisions lightly entered into have been as lightly abandoned.  It is not surprising that under this system several senior Labour Ministers have at different times left the Government in disgust at the way it is run. It is not surprising that when ever I have travelled abroad in recent years friends of Britain have told me of their sadness at the way in which our reputation has shrunk. It is not surprising that young people in this country looking at politics for the first time should be suspicious and cynical.  I am determined therefore that a Conservative Government shall introduce a new style of government: that we shall re-establish our sound and honest British traditions in this field.  I want to see a fresh approach to the taking of decisions. The Government should seek the best advice and listen carefully to it. It should not rush into decisions, it should use up-to-date techniques for assessing the situation, it should be deliberate and thorough. And in coming to its decisions it must always recognise that its responsibility is to the people, and all the people, of this country.  What is more, its decision should be aimed at the long term. The easy answer and the quick trick may pay immediate dividends in terms of publicity, but in the end it is the national interest which suffers. We have seen that too often in the recent past  Finally, once a decision is made, once a policy is established, the Prime Minister and his colleagues should have the courage to stick to it Nothing has done Britain more harm in the world than the endless backing and filling which we have seen in recent years. Whether it be our defence commitments, or our financial policies, or the reform of industrial relations, the story has been the same. At the first sign of difficulty the Labour Government has sounded the retreat, covering its withdrawal with a smokescreen of unlikely excuses. But courage and intellectual honesty are essential qualities in politics, and in the interest of our country it is high time that we saw them again.  So it will not be enough for a Conservative Government to make a fresh start with new policies. We must create a new way of running our national affairs. This means sweeping away the trivialities and the gimmicks which now dominate the political scene. It means dealing honestly and openly with the House of Commons, with the press and with the public.  The decisions which a Government has to take affect the livelihood and perhaps the lives of millions of our fellow citizens. No-one has any business to take part in public life unless he is prepared to take such decisions with the seriousness which they deserve.  This is my strongest personal conviction, and I shall not be content until it is the guiding principle of the government of this country.  EDWARD HEATH  A BETTER TOMORROW  This election is about Britain's tomorrow. The choice of a Government for the next five years will go far to determine the future of our country right through the seventies and beyond.  THE FAILURES OF TODAY  The nation now knows what five years of Labour rule can mean. Hundreds of thousands of extra families suffering the hardship and insecurity of unemployment. Increasing problems of poverty and homelessness. Pensioners helpless as they watch the extra shillings eaten up by the fastest price rise for twenty years. Housewives struggling to make ends meet. £3,000 million a year of extra taxation equivalent to £3.10. 0d a week for every family. A devalued £. A new load of foreign debt, some of it stretching ahead into the twenty-first century.  Britain has paid many times over in lost opportunity for the benefit of any improvement on our overseas trade account. The nation has lost £12,000 million in potential wealth as the result of Labour's failure to maintain expansion. That's about £750 for every family in the country.  Our economy has expanded more slowly than that of any other comparable country in the world. Almost everywhere in Western Europe and North America the standard of living grows faster than in Britain. International experts are predicting that if these trends are allowed to continue Britain will soon be the poorest major country in the West.  As a nation, we have been starved of achievement. We have become conditioned to failure.  To pay our way, normal in Conservative years, now seems like a miracle. High unemployment is no longer the exception but the rule. We have become resigned to the value of the £ in our pockets or purses falling by at least a shilling a year. For a year to pass without a crisis has become cause for congratulation.  Yet before these locust years of Labour, we had the Conservative years of rising prosperity. Years when Britain's industry expanded faster. When the standard of living grew three times as fast. When prices rose more slowly. When unemployment was low. When tax rates were cut time after time. When pensions rose twice as fast as prices. When the social services at home advanced more rapidly, and Britain played a proper part in helping poorer countries overseas.  Conservatives are proud of yesterday's achievements. Angered by today's failures. Determined that tomorrow shall be better again.  We remember 1966, when the strengthening balance of payments which was Labour's true inheritance was smothered by the disastrous irresponsibility of a Party whose one concern was electoral success. Before the election, surplus and smiles. Afterwards, savage tax increases, the wage freeze, and a headlong plunge into deficit, devaluation and debt. It need not and must not be allowed to happen again.  LABOUR HAS NOTHING TO OFFER  Labour's policies for the future are their policies of the past. Nothing to curb the rise in prices. Nothing to cut the human waste of unemployment. Nothing to see that extra social help goes where the need is greatest.  More taxes. More blanket subsidies. More state ownership. More civil servants. More government interference.  No new encouragement to earn and save. No new incentive to invest and expand. No new policy to bring about better relations in industry. No new deal for our farmers.  Just the mixture as before.  They have little to boast of in their record. Even less to put forward for the future. So they talk, instead, of their ideals.  But lust what are those ideals?  What ideal is it that leads a government to policies that double the rate of unemployment?  What ideal is it that makes it impossible for so many young couples to afford a home of their own, sets out to prevent people buying the council house they live in, and brings about the biggest drop in house-building in a quarter of a century?  What ideal is it that makes the poor get poorer, and three times votes down pensions for the over-eighties?  What ideal is it that breaks our country's word abroad, weakens our defences, leaves our friends in the lurch, and cuts down our overseas aid?  What ideal is it that has to be propped up by rigging electoral boundaries?  What ideal is it that leaves a litter of broken promises wherever it goes?  Labour must answer for itself. But whatever its ideals may be, they have nothing in common with the values which Conservatives proclaim.  THE CONSERVATIVE WAY  We want to build a better Britain. A Britain we can all be proud of. A Britain in which future generations will be happy to live. A. Britain which other nations will admire.  We want a country which makes the fullest use of all its human and material resources to build a new prosperity. A country which uses that prosperity wisely and well, helping the elderly and those in need, providing new educational opportunity for our children, investing for the future as well as giving us a fuller life today. A country confident in itself, playing a full part in the world's affairs, accepting and meeting its responsibilities to others.  We want a society in which material advance goes hand in hand with the deeper values which go to make up the quality of life. A society which cares for its cities, towns and villages, its rivers, its coast, its countryside.  We want people to achieve the security and independence of personal ownership greater freedom of opportunity, greater freedom of choice, greater freedom from government regulation and interference. A responsible democracy based on honest government and respect for the law.  Despite all the failures and frustrations of recent years, Britain is still the best country n the world in which to live. But at best we have been marking time, at worst slipping back. It could and should be so much better.  PROGRAMME FOR A PARLIAMENT  In this Manifesto we present our policies to end the retreat and begin instead a new advance.  Our policies are not, like Labour's, a collection of short lived devices. They make up a strategy for the next five years - a programme for a Parliament.  Nor are they a set of promises made only to be broken. The last Conservative Government kept all its promises. So will the next.  We start with the economy because this remains the key. The true problem in social policy is not that we spend too much but that with Labour stagnation we can afford too little.  Britain now faces the worst inflation for twenty years. This is mainly the result of tax increases and devaluation. In implementing all our policies, the need to curb inflation will come first. For only then can our broader strategy succeed.  Our theme is to replace Labour's restrictions with Conservative incentive. We utterly reject the philosophy of compulsory wage control. We want instead to get production up and encourage everyone to give of their best.  - We want an economy based on more jobs, higher wages that are well-earned, and lower costs.  - We will reduce and reform taxation, giving first priority to reducing income tax so that people will keep a fairer reward for their work.  - We will create the basis for these reductions by giving new incentive to saving and by cutting out unnecessary state spending.  - We will strengthen responsible trade unions and good management by establishing fair, up-to-date rules for industrial relations.  - We will greatly increase opportunities for men and women to train for new and better jobs.  - We will stop further nationalisation, and create a climate for free enterprise to expand.  - We will introduce effective regional development policies to bring prosperity to every part of our country.  - We will give agriculture a real opportunity to increase production.  These are policies to enable people and government to work together to create new national wealth. Only on the secure basis of this foundation can we help everyone to build a better tomorrow for themselves and their families.  Our education policy will give greater priority to the primary schools, where an inadequate start can so easily destroy the chance that every child must have to develop its talents to the full.  We will reverse the decline in building, make home ownership easier again, and concentrate Government subsidies where they are most needed.  We will give priority to those most in need - the over-80s without pensions, the elderly, the disabled, the chronic sick, the children in families below the poverty line.  Our policies will reduce the causes of racial tension, and we will ensure that there will be no further large scale permanent immigration.  We will protect Britain's interests overseas, and play our part in promoting peace and progress in the world.  These policies will strengthen Britain so that we can negotiate with the European Community confident in the knowledge that we can stand on our own if the price is too high.  A NEW OPPORTUNITY  The aim of these policies is to create the new opportunity for a better tomorrow.  - A better tomorrow with living standards rising again at a reasonable rate so that every family can enjoy a fuller life.  - A better tomorrow for all: for the families that are homeless today, for the unemployed; for the children still in poverty, and for the old and the lonely.  - A better tomorrow with greater freedom: freedom to earn and to save, freedom from government interference, freedom of choice, freedom from fear of crime and violence.  - A better tomorrow in a better Britain: with the beauty of our countryside preserved and improved, with our towns and cities made more pleasant to live in. A better tomorrow with a deeper appreciation of the quality and goodness of life.  Our nation has so much to be proud of and so much to offer. All we need now is a new opportunity that will allow the people of Britain to create for themselves a better tomorrow.  OUR PROGRAMME  These are our plans for making tomorrow better than today.  LOWER TAXES  We will reduce taxation. We will simplify the tax system.  We will concentrate on making progressive and substantial reductions in income tax and surtax.  These reductions will be possible because we will cut Out unnecessary Government spending and because we will encourage savings. And as our national income rises we will get a larger revenue with lower tax rates.  We will abolish the Selective Employment Tax, as part of a wider reform of indirect taxation possibly involving the replacement of purchase tax by a value-added tax.  The value-added tax, already widely adopted in Western Europe and Scandinavia, is in effect a general sales tax, operated in a way which allows for desirable exemptions - for example, exports. It could help to make our system of taxes on spending more broadly based, less discriminatory, and fairer in its impact on different types of industry and service.  It would not apply to food, except for those few items already subject to purchase tax. It would not apply to normal farming activities, nor to very small businesses; and special arrangements would be made for housing. No Opposition could commit itself finally in advance of an election to a major new tax of this kind which would need detailed consultation with the civil service.  Labour's betterment levy has increased bureaucracy and put up the price of land and houses. We will do away with it and collect any tax due on a sale of land through the capital gains tax, with exemption for owner-occupiers.  We will end the tax nonsense which makes some married couples pay more tax on their joint earnings than they would if they were not married. We will repeal the Labour changes which have imposed new penalties on children's income and disallowed the interest on many loans as a deduction from income for tax purposes.  We will encourage the flow of private funds to charities including voluntary social service, sport and the arts.  Labour has put tax rates up by over £3,000 million. We are determined to reverse this process. High taxation discourages effort and saving, deadens the spirit of enterprise and causes many of our best brains to leave the country.  In the thirteen years of Conservative prosperity we cut tax rates by £2,000 million - as well as doubling expenditure on the social services. We have done it before: we can do it again.  MORE SAVINGS  When savings go up, taxes can come down. If savings had increased as fast during the last six years under Labour as they did in the previous six years with the Conservatives, taxation could now be £2,000 million lower - the equivalent of the whole of the selective employment tax and more than two shillings off income tax.  We will encourage all forms of saving, and saving at every level of earnings. Every family should be able to accumulate savings to give security and independence, to provide for their old age and their children's future.  Our tax policies will stimulate savings. We will introduce a more imaginative contractual savings scheme designed particularly to attract new savings. Our plans for more home ownership and an extension of private and occupational pension schemes must mean higher personal savings. We have already done much and will do more to develop a 'property-owning democracy': now we must also progress towards the capital-owning democracy of the future, for individuals and families who save and accumulate wealth serve the nation as truly as they serve themselves.  CONTROLLING GOVERNMENT SPENDING  Under Labour, there has been too much government interference in the day-to-day workings of industry and local government. There has been too much government: there will be less.  We will reduce the number of Ministers. We will reduce the number of civil servants: under Labour their numbers have grown by over 60,000. The Land Commission will be abolished. The functions and responsibilities of all departments and government agencies will be systematically rationalised. There will be cost-reduction plans for every single Ministry in Whitehall, and the widespread application throughout government of the most modern management, budgeting and cost-effectiveness techniques. Some present government activities could be better organised using competent managers recruited from industry and commerce. Plans to achieve this new style of government are well advanced. It will be more efficient and less costly.  Detailed policies set out in this document will also lead to reductions in the weight of government spending.  STEADIER PRICES  The cost of living has rocketed during the last six years. Prices are now rising more than twice as fast as they did during the Conservative years. And prices have been zooming upwards at the very same time as the Government have been taking an ever-increasing slice of people's earnings in taxation. Soaring prices and increasing taxes are an evil and disastrous combination.  Inflation is not only damaging to the economy; it is a major cause of social injustice, always hitting hardest at the weakest and poorest members of the community.  The main causes of rising prices are Labour's damaging policies of high taxation and devaluation. Labour's compulsory wage control was a failure and we will not repeat it.  The Labour Government's own figures show that, last year, taxation and price increases more than cancelled any increase in incomes. So wages started chasing prices up in a desperate and understandable attempt to improve living standards.  Other countries achieve a low-cost high-wage economy. So can we. Our policies of strengthening competition will help to keep down prices in the shops. Our policies for cutting taxes, for better industrial relations, for greater retraining, for improved efficiency in Government and industry - all these will help to stimulate output. This faster growth will mean that we can combine higher wages with steadier prices to bring a real increase in living standards.  Under the last Conservative Government, wages rose twice as fast as prices, living standards rose three times as fast as they have under Labour, and Britain achieved one of the best records in Europe for steady prices.  The Labour Government's policies have unleashed forces which no Government could hope to reverse overnight. The first essential is for the new Government to give a new lead. We will subject all proposed price rises in the public sector to the most searching scrutiny. If they are not justified, they will not be allowed. In implementing our policies, we will give overriding priority to bringing the present inflation under control.  FAIR DEAL AT WORK  There were more strikes in 1969 than ever before in our history. Already in the first three months of 1970 there were 1,134 strikes compared with 718 in the same period last year, when the Labour Government said the position was so serious that legislation was essential in the national interest. This rapid and serious deterioration directly stems from Labour's failure to carry through its own policy for the reform of industrial relations.  We will introduce a comprehensive Industrial Relations Bill in the first Session of the new Parliament. It will provide a proper framework of law within which improved relation ships between management, men and unions can develop. We welcome the TUC's willingness to take action through its own machinery against those who disrupt industrial peace by unconstitutional or unofficial action. Yet it is no substitute for the new set of fair and reasonable rules we will introduce.  We aim to strengthen the unions and their official leadership by providing some deter rent against irresponsible action by unofficial minorities. We seek to create conditions in which strikes become the means of last resort, not of first resort, as they now so often are.  Our new Act will establish clear rights and obligations for unions and employers. It will lay down what is lawful and what isn't lawful in the conduct of industrial disputes. It will also introduce new safeguards for the individual - the right of appeal against unjust dismissal by an employer or unjust action by a union.  The framework of law we will establish will provide for agreements to be binding on both unions and employers. A new Registrar of Trades Unions and Employers' Associations will ensure that their rules are fair, just, democratic, and not in conflict with the public interest. In the case of a dispute which would seriously endanger the national interest, our Act will provide for the holding of a secret ballot and for a 'cooling-off period' of not less than sixty days.  Associated with our new Act will be a Code of Practice laying down guidelines for good collective agreements and standards for good management and trade union practices in the individual company.  TRAINING FOR BETTER JOBS  We want to help people seeking new and better jobs. This involves provision for redundancy, opportunities for retraining, the maintenance of living standards during retraining, and assistance - particularly with housing - for those who have to move. Existing arrangements are inadequate: they will be improved. We will stimulate a massive retraining programme for men and women in industry. We will closely examine the work of the Industrial Training Boards and the operation of the levy/grant system, so as to root out unnecessary bureaucracy and ensure the full support of industry and the closest co-operation with further and higher education.  We will also encourage wider and better provision for management training. Modern industry imposes new and heavy burdens on all levels of management. Good management is essential not only for efficiency and the proper use of capital resources, but also for the creation of good industrial relations.  INDUSTRIAL PROGRESS  Competitive free enterprise ensures choice for the consumer. Profitable free enterprise provides the resources for both capital investment and higher wages. We will pursue a vigorous competition policy. We will check any abuse of dominant market power or monopoly, strengthening and reforming the machinery which exists.  We reject the detailed intervention of Socialism which usurps the functions of management and seeks to dictate prices and earnings in industry. We much prefer a system of general pressures, creating an economic climate which favours, and rewards, enterprise and efficiency. Our aim is to identify and remove obstacles that prevent effective competition and restrict initiative.  We will sharpen the disclosure requirements in the accounts of public companies subject to an exemption procedure and reduce them for most private companies, and will institute an inquiry into other aspects of company law. As prosperity increases we will progressively reduce restrictions on overseas investment.  Small businesses have had a raw deal from Labour. They have had to suffer higher and more complicated taxes, and waste more time filling up forms. Our policies for reducing taxation and reducing government interference in industry will reduce the heavy burdens on the small firm. We will decide the best method of providing advice and encouragement for small businesses in the light of the Bolton Report.  We are totally opposed to further nationalisation of British industry. We will repeal the so-called Industrial Expansion Act which gives the Government power to use taxpayers money to buy its way into private industry. Specific projects approved by Parliament will continue to be given Government support. We will drastically modify the Industrial Reorganisation Corporation Act.  The quality and cost of transport services affect the fares and prices everyone pays. We will continue an expanding road programme, improving in particular roads in Scotland, Wales, the South West, and the development areas. 85 per cent of the freight throughout the country is carried by road. Cheap and efficient service must be combined with high standards of public safety. We will repeal the Labour Government's law which would prevent lorries driving more than 100 miles without a specially obtained licence.  We will progressively reduce the involvement of the State in the nationalised industries, for example in the steel industry, so as to improve their competitiveness. An increasing use of private capital will help to reduce the burden on the taxpayer, get better investment decisions, and ensure more effective use of total resources.  The railways have a vital part to play in the modernisation of the transport system. They need to provide new passenger facilities, interchanges with the car and bus, and freight depots outside the urban areas. Shipping lines, hotels, parking facilities, catering services, vacant land, can all be developed more effectively in partnership with private enterprise. This will give better service to the public.  We will prevent the waste of £76 million on the nationalisation of the ports. We will end the uncertainty hanging over both large and small ports by giving them the freedom to build, in competition with each other but co-ordinated through a strong central authority.  The bureaucratic burden imposed upon industry by government departments, agencies and boards has steadily increased in recent years. We will see that it is reduced.  We will encourage investment through tax allowances or reductions rather than by means of grant - with differential arrangements in favour of the development areas. And the more flexible system of grants under the Local Employment Acts will be retained as an important part of our regional policy. These changes will be subject to transitional arrangements and will not in any way be retrospective. Special assistance for particular industries like shipping will be continued.  PROSPERITY FOR ALL AREAS  We regard an effective regional development policy as a vital element in our economic and social strategy; economically, because both prosperous and less prosperous areas are affected by the present regional imbalance and waste of resources it involves; socially, because we are not prepared to tolerate the human waste and suffering that accompany persistent unemployment, dereliction and decline.  We will stimulate long-term growth by increasing the basic economic attraction of the areas concerned. This is a markedly different approach from that followed by Labour, who have five separate and often unco-ordinated government departments spending very large sums of money with little regard to the practical effect. Despite the Government's lavish spending of the taxpayer's money during the last six years, in Scotland, Wales, and most regions of England there are hundreds of thousands fewer jobs. Since 1966, the country has experienced the longest period of high unemployment since the 1930s.  We will link expenditure more closely to the creation of new jobs, especially in industries with growth potential, and to improvements in the economic facilities of the development areas. We will maintain regional assistance to each development area. We will initiate a thorough-going study of development area policy as was recommended by the Hunt Committee. We will phase out the Regional Employment Premium, taking proper account of existing obligations and commitments. We will maintain financial incentives for investment in the development areas, making greater use of the powers given by the Local Employments Acts, and these powers will also be used where appropriate in the intermediate areas. We will give fairer treatment to the service industries and to commerce. We will give special attention to the needs of the development areas in our plans for a massive increase in retraining facilities.  Some resources could with advantage be switched from the present general subsidies towards the better training schemes and the infra-structure needed to make both development and intermediate areas more attractive to live in - and to invest in. More skilled workers, good housing, better schools, and first-class communications provide a surer long-term answer to the problems of regional development than indiscriminate financial hand-outs.  We will continue to provide financial assistance to the Northern Ireland Government so that all parts of Northern Ireland may enjoy the full benefits of United Kingdom prosperity.  FOOD AND FARMING  Farmers are frustrated and disgruntled. Labour has failed to allow British agriculture to expand and prosper. We will provide new opportunities for the farming community to increase production, improve their incomes, and make a further massive contribution through import-saving to the balance of payments.  We will retain the Annual Price Review system, the production grant system, and the marketing boards, but will introduce levies on imports in order to enable us to eliminate the need for deficiency payments in their present form. These levies, variable at very short notice, will deal effectively and immediately with dumping from overseas and will thus do away with the old cumbersome and slow procedures. The changeover will be spread over at least three years. The present support system will be maintained in full throughout this transitional period, although its cost will decline. Thereafter it will continue in the form of a 'fall-back' guarantee. Before the new system is introduced, there will be full discussions with our inter national suppliers and with the farmers' unions.  This fundamental change will provide much-needed scope for agricultural expansion. The resultant small increase in food prices will amount to just over a penny in the £ per year on the cost of living for three years - a small increase in comparison with the five shillings in the £ rise of the last six years. The Exchequer will benefit by some £250 million, which can be used for tax reductions and for selective improvements in social security payments.  We will free from rates all buildings which a farmer uses for producing food from his land.  We will continue to encourage the development of British horticulture through the Horticultural Improvement Scheme. We will also maintain, and where appropriate expand, statutory provision through the Central Council for Agricultural and Horticultural Co-operation, to encourage better and more uniform marketing of horticultural produce.  A thriving and expanding forestry industry can reduce dependence upon costly imported timber and can, particularly in Scotland, make good use of difficult land and provide a comparatively high level of employment.  We will promote the prosperity of the fishing industry, and will ensure that the home fishing industry is enabled to compete effectively in British markets without unfair competition from dumped imports.  HOMES FOR ALL  New drive and impetus is urgently needed to reverse the biggest decline in the housing programme for a quarter of a century. Labour has failed to honour its pledge to build 500,000 houses a year by 1970. It is scandalous that this year, as last year, fewer houses will be completed than in 1964 when Labour took over. And far fewer are under construction. One million people to whom Labour promised a new home by 1970 are still waiting.  Our vigorous new housing drive for the 1970s will have three main objectives:  - To house the homeless, to concentrate on slum clearance and to provide better housing for those many families living without modern amenities.  - To bring about a great increase in home ownership so that the majority of our nation fulfil their wish to live in a home of their own.  - To see that the tenant, whether of a private property or of a council house, receives a fair deal.  Under the present subsidy system, too little help goes to the homeless and the badly housed; too little help also goes to provide housing for the elderly and the disabled. We will re-negotiate the housing subsidy system so that the full weight of Government assistance goes behind tackling the worst areas of our housing problems.  The problem of the homeless is concealed by unrealistic official statistics. We will lay down a more sensible definition, and then make sure that families without a home or living in intolerable conditions receive priority.  We seek a big increase in the programme of modernisation of our older houses, in co-operation with movements such as Shelter.  We will, in consultation with the voluntary housing movement, give a new momentum to housing associations, co-ownership and cost-rent groups. This movement, if encouraged and assisted in its organisation and financing, can do much to cope with and to care for the problems of the elderly and the homeless.  Too often those confronted with housing problems have nowhere to turn for advice. Housing advisory centres will be set up in co-operation with voluntary housing organisations and the local authorities. People will then have an easy means of discovering how they can apply for a council house or an improvement grant, how they can obtain a mortgage, how the 'fair rent' system works, or where to contact a housing association or a cost-rent society.  The number of new houses built for owner-occupation has declined month by month. The increase in the cost of new houses and the highest mortgage interest rates in our history have prevented thousands of young people from becoming owners of their own homes. Labour promised cheaper houses and lower mortgage interest rates. But today the mortgage repayments on the average-priced new house are £3 per week more than when Labour came to power.  Our policies to abolish the Selective Employment Tax and to abolish the Land Commission, and to get more land released for building, will help to keep down house prices.  We will make both the 100 per cent mortgage scheme and the mortgage option scheme more flexible.  The improvements we will make to the Save As You Earn scheme will encourage a larger flow of funds into building societies.  We will encourage local authorities to sell council houses to those of their tenants who wish to buy them. Thus many council house tenants of today will become the owners of their own homes tomorrow. As a result, more money will be immediately available for the local authorities to provide housing for the aged, for the disabled, and for those on the housing lists.  Our policies for encouraging home ownership will also mean that more council house tenants can move into homes of their own, thus releasing their council houses for those in need.  The present system of government council house subsidies is wasteful and inefficient; all too often those receiving subsidies are better off than those who pay for them through rates and taxes. We will change the system so that subsidies are used for adequate rent rebates for those tenants who cannot afford to pay fair rents, and also for slum clearance and other essential programmes.  We will maintain the security of tenure provisions of the 1965 Housing Act, and the fair rent system. We will continue the process - started under Labour's Housing Act of 1969 - of their gradual extension to the remaining controlled tenancies.  We will review and improve the machinery of compensation to see that it is fair and just to those whose property is compulsorily purchased or adversely affected or blighted by road and redevelopment schemes.  SOCIAL SERVICE ADVANCE  The fundamental problem of all Britain's social services - education, health, provision for the old and those in need - is the shortage of resources.  Of course money isn't everything. Much will always depend on the devoted work and care of teachers, doctors, nurses, welfare workers of all kinds, both professional and voluntary. But too often today their most dedicated efforts are frustrated and undermined by inadequate facilities and never-ending worry about finance.  With Labour's economic stagnation it is little wonder that in many cases these problems are getting steadily worse. The slow-down in economic growth which Labour Government has brought has already cost our country some £12,000 million in lost production. Even one-tenth of the revenue lost by the Government as a result of this stagnation would have paid for 100 hospitals and 1,000 schools.  In our last five years of Government, spending on the social services increased at a much faster rate in real terms than in the five years of Labour Government. Taking account of rising prices, Selective Employment Tax, the family allowance clawback, and the increased cost of unemployment benefit, our spending increased 36 per cent compared with only 25 per cent under Labour.  Our aim is to develop and improve Britain's social services to the full: here too, tomorrow must be better than today.  Immediately we can help by establishing more sensible priorities. But the only true solution is to increase what we can afford. The theme and purpose of our policies for the economy is to enable government and people to work together to create new national wealth. Only then will there be a firm foundation for new social advance.  BETTER EDUCATION  In education above all the problem of resources is crucial. The number of children in the schools is rising. More and more are qualifying to go on to colleges, polytechnics and universities. That they should be able to develop their abilities to the full is not only right in itself but a vital national investment in the future.  Within the education budget itself, we shall shift the emphasis in favour of primary schools - the foundation on which all later education and training is built.  We also recognise the need for expansion of nursery education. This is especially important in areas of social handicap, such as the poorer parts of our large cities, where it is so vital to give children a better start.  In secondary education, a number of different patterns have developed over the years, including many types of comprehensive school. We will maintain the existing rights of local education authorities to decide what is best for their area.  They will take into account the general acceptance that in most cases the age of eleven is too early to make final decisions which might affect a child's whole future. Many of the most imaginative new schemes abolishing the eleven-plus have been introduced by Conservative councils.  Local councils must ensure that the education they provide is the best for the children, taking into account the suitability of the buildings, the supply of staff, the travelling distances involved, the advice of teachers, and the wishes of parents and local electors. And they must be certain that they provide properly for the late developer. And they will naturally be slow to make irrevocable changes to any good school unless they are sure that the alternative is better.  We believe that the proper role of the central government is to satisfy itself that every local education authority provides education which will enable a child's talents and abilities to be developed to the full, at whatever age these may appear. All children must have the opportunity of getting to 'O' level and beyond if they are capable of doing so.  We therefore believe that Labour's attempt to insist on compulsory reorganisation on rigid lines is contrary to local democracy and contrary to the best interests of the children.  We will raise the school leaving age to sixteen as planned. Opportunities should be given to some children, under the authority of their head teacher, to take advantage in their final year of the facilities available in colleges of further education.  We will encourage the direct grant schools. Many of these schools have an excellent record and provide opportunities which may not otherwise be available for children of academic ability, regardless of their parents' income.  Parents must have the freedom to send their children to independent schools if they wish.  The demand for higher and further education in universities, polytechnics and other colleges will increase during the 1970s. We will expand the number of places available.  Concern about teacher training is widespread. We will institute an inquiry into teacher training, as the Plowden Committee recommended. We wish the teaching profession to have a career structure which will attract recruits of high quality into the profession, and retain them.  CARE FOR THOSE IN NEED  Between 1951 and 1964, Conservative Governments increased pensions five times, and the real value of the basic State pension rose by 50 per cent. We will review retirement pensions every two years to ensure that they at least maintain their purchasing power and that pensioners' living standards are properly protected.  The next Conservative Government will take urgent action to give some pension as of right to the over-eighties who now get no retirement pension at all. We will improve the benefits payable to those who are seriously ill or disabled, and introduce a constant attendance allowance for the most seriously disabled. We will improve the present situation where a woman who is just over fifty when she is widowed gets a pension but a widow just under fifty gets nothing.  We will continue to ease the earnings rule for retirement pensions and we will also increase the additions to the pension which can be earned by postponing retirement beyond the minimum age.  We believe that everyone should have the opportunity of earning a pension related to their earnings. But, in contrast to the Labour Party, our view is that, for the great majority of people, this can and should be achieved through the expansion and improvement of occupational schemes. And we will ensure that everyone can take their pension rights with them when they change their job.  There are some people who may not be covered by an occupational scheme, and for them there will be a reserve earnings-related State scheme over and above the basic flat-rate scheme. But this is intended as a reserve scheme, and all approved occupational schemes will be enabled to contract out of it completely under simple conditions.  Labour's complicated pension scheme would be unfair to existing pensioners and would harm the pension prospects of the twelve-and-a-half million members of occupational schemes. It would severely damage the growth of savings and mean ever-increasing taxation.  Our proposals will be fair to those who are now old, and also fair to those now working. Under Labour's scheme their pension prospects would depend upon the willingness of future generations to pay an ever-increasing pensions bill through mounting taxation. Under our proposal, a growing part of the future cost of pensions will be met through genuine savings.  Retirement pensions, sickness, unemployment, widowhood and industrial injuries benefits will continue to be paid as of right, and without means tests, in return for National Insurance contributions. These contributions will be graduated according to earnings, and the present flat-rate contributions - which have become a heavy burden on the lower paid during recent years - will be abolished.  We will lower the age at which public service and armed forces pension increases become payable to fifty-five, and the pensions of those who retired before 1956 will be brought up to the same level as if they had retired then with appropriate increases since. The purchasing power of public service pensions will also be protected by a two-yearly review. Special treatment will be given to war pensioners and their widows.  We will take firm action to deal with abuse of the social security system. We will tighten up the administration so as to prevent the whole system being brought into disrepute by the shirkers and the scroungers.  We will tackle the problem of family poverty and ensure that adequate family allowances go to those families that need them. A scheme based upon negative income tax would allow benefits to be related to family need; other families would benefit by reduced taxation. The Government has exaggerated the administrative problems involved, and we will make a real effort to find a practical solution. If this can be done, it will increase incentive for those at work, and bring much-needed help to children living in poverty.  We welcome the recently announced improved rates of supplementary benefit.  More emphasis is required on the provision of care for the elderly, the chronic sick and handicapped people, and particularly on the expansion of those services which provide help in the home. We welcomed the Seebohm Report's recommendations on local authority social services and supported the legislation which followed. We will, in consultation with the local authorities, improve local social services so that help is more readily available to those in need.  We recognise the important contribution to social welfare that volunteers and voluntary organisations are already making, and we believe there is scope for considerable expansion and development. We are convinced that many of the social problems that now scar society can only be solved through a genuine partnership of effort between statutory and voluntary organisations - between the professional and the volunteer.  We will give active support, both financially and legislatively, so that new opportunities may be created in co-operation with the local authorities for all those - and in particular the young people and the retired people - who want to do voluntary social work.  As a result of the slow rate of economic growth under Labour, the resources going into the Health Service are inadequate. There are too many outdated hospitals, too many old people not getting the care they need in their own homes, too many mentally ill people either in overcrowded hospital wards or getting insufficient care through local community services. And too many of those working in the health service lack a decent career structure.  We will improve the administration of the health service so that its three main branches - hospitals, general practitioners, and local health services - are better co-ordinated. This will mean better value for money and better care for the patient. We will also improve the ways of dealing with suggestions and complaints from both patients and staff.  In forward planning for health, we will put more emphasis on community services. This will enable more people to be looked after at home where they are happier, rather than n hospitals and residential institutions. We will increase the number of health centres and encourage more group practice to improve the working conditions for doctors.  Labour see 'danger' in the growth of private provision in health and welfare. We believe it right and proper that people should be free to provide for themselves and their families if they wish.  RACE RELATIONS AND IMMIGRATION  Good race relations are of immense importance. We are determined that all citizens shall continue to be treated as equal before the law, and without discrimination. Our policies for education, health and housing will help to reduce the causes of racial tension. The sooner prosperity returns, the sooner additional resources will be available to tackle the problems of poverty, decay and squalor in our towns and cities. Local authority services are under great strain in many of the towns and cities where large numbers of immigrants have settled. We believe that additional funds should be made available to these local authorities in order that they can deal with these problems effectively without placing heavy burdens on their ratepayers.  We will establish a new single system of control over all immigration from overseas. The Home Secretary of the day will have complete control, subject to the machinery for appeal, over the entry of individuals into Britain. We believe it right to allow an existing Commonwealth immigrant who is already here to bring his wife and young children to join him in this country. But for the future, work permits will not carry the right of permanent settlement for the holder or his dependants. Such permits as are issued will be limited to a specific job in a specific area for a fixed period, normally twelve months. There will of course be no restrictions on travel.  These policies mean that future immigration will be allowed only in strictly defined special cases. There will be no further large scale permanent immigration.  We will give assistance to Commonwealth immigrants who wish to return to their countries of origin, but we will not tolerate any attempt to harass or compel them to go against their will.  GOVERNMENT AND THE CITIZEN  The Government in Whitehall is overloaded, and as a result people in the regions grow increasingly impatient about the decisions being made in London which they know could be better made locally. Under our new style of government, we will devolve government power so that more decisions are made locally.  Scotland, with its distinct identity, traditions and legal system, is particularly conscious of these problems.  The Report of the Committee set up under Sir Alec Douglas-Home offers a new chance for the Scottish people to have a greater say in their own affairs. Its contents, including the proposal for a Scottish Convention sitting in Edinburgh, will form a basis for the proposals we will place before Parliament, taking account of the impending re-organisation of local government.  We are publishing separate manifestos for Scotland and Wales.  We reaffirm that no change will be made in the constitutional status of Northern Ireland without the free consent of the Parliament of Northern Ireland.  We support the Northern Ireland Government in its programme of legislative and executive action to ensure equal opportunity for all citizens in that part of the United Kingdom. We will provide the military and other aid necessary to support the Royal Ulster Constabulary in keeping the peace and ensuring freedom under the law; with the Ulster Defence Regiment as a strong and efficient reserve force capable of playing a significant role in maintaining peace and security.  The independence of local authorities has been seriously eroded by Labour Ministers. On many issues, particularly in education and housing, they have deliberately overridden the views of elected councillors. We think it wrong that the balance of power between central and local government should have been distorted, and we will redress the balance and increase the independence of local authorities.  We are convinced of the need for reform of the present structure of local government. Unfortunately, the Terms of Reference given to the Redcliffe-Maud and Wheatley Royal Commissions which examined this problem in England and in Scotland respectively were restricted. As a result, the crucial questions of devolution of power from the central government and of local government finance were not adequately dealt with in their Reports. We believe that these matters must be considered and that those concerned in local government must be fully consulted before final decisions are made.  We will bring forward a sensible measure of local government reform which will involve a genuine devolution of power from the central government and will provide for the existence of a two-tier structure. There will be full consultation about the pattern of boundaries and the effect of changes upon existing resources of local government  We will ensure that the legitimate interests of existing local government staff are fully safeguarded in any changes made in the structure of local government. Similarly, reductions in the number of civil servants can be achieved by restricting recruitment and allowing the normal processes of retirement and resignation to reduce numbers. Adequate financial compensation will be paid to any civil servant or local government officer made redundant, and the career prospects of those who are transferred will be safeguarded.  Traditionally, changes in Parliamentary constituency boundaries are made on the recommendation of the impartial Boundaries Commission. The Labour Government has broken this tradition in order to gain an unfair advantage at this election. We will return to the previous honest and fair system.  FREEDOM UNDER THE LAW  Protection of the individual citizen is a prime duty of government. Urgent action is needed to check the serious rise in crime and violence. The Labour Government cannot entirely shrug off responsibility for the present situation since they restricted police recruitment at a critical time.  The best deterrent to crime is the likelihood of being caught. We will strengthen the police force. We will restore the prison building programme, taking special care to provide secure detention for the most dangerous criminals.  In some respects the law needs modernising and clarifying, and needs to be made less slow and cumbersome, particularly for dealing with offences - forcible entry, obstruction and violent offences concerned with public order - peculiar to the age of demonstration and disruption. A Conservative Government will do this.  We will also change the law so that the demonstrator who uses violence, or the criminal who causes personal injury or damages property, will be obliged to compensate his victim in addition to fines or other punishments imposed by the Courts.  A tolerant and civilised society must continue to permit its citizens to assemble, march and demonstrate in support of the ideals and principles they believe in. Our purpose is to protect the citizen against disruption of lawful activities and, to that end, we will immediately institute an inquiry into the law affecting trespass. Such a reform of the law would in no way inhibit the peaceful use of the right to demonstrate or strike.  We will eliminate unnecessary secrecy concerning the workings of the Government, and we will review the operation of the Official Secrets Act so that government is more open and more accountable to the public.  The functions and powers of government have expanded so much in recent years that the traditional safeguards for the citizen no longer suffice. Although we will reduce government activity and interference, a better system of control and examination of decisions by civil servants, public bodies and local authorities which affect individual citizens is also needed. Parliament during recent years has often passed government legislation which has infringed individual rights and given wide discretionary powers to Ministers and their civil servants. We will closely examine ways of safeguarding more effectively and equitably the rights and freedom of the individual citizen.  A Conservative Government introduced equal pay for women in the teaching profession, in local government, and in the non-industrial Civil Service in the 1950s. We have supported and sought to improve the equal pay legislation.  But this alone does not ensure genuine equality of opportunity. Many barriers still exist which prevent women from participating to the full in the entire life of the country. Women are treated by the law, in some respects, as having inferior rights to men, we will amend the law to remove this discrimination.  We will clear away the remaining anomalies in family law and make fairer provision for women in the event of separation or bereavement. We will help deserted wives by improving the enforcement of maintenance orders.  A BETTER ENVIRONMENT  Economic growth and technological innovation are the principal means of achieving a continuing improvement in our standard of living. But the effects of technological change can sometimes lead to a deterioration in the natural environment and in the quality of life. The public are rightly concerned about these dangers.  We will improve the machinery of government for dealing with these problems. We will review existing legislation to ensure proper and sensible control in the future. The damage of the past must be repaired. The worst scars are in and around our industrial cities and towns. We will ensure that the natural beauty of our British countryside and seashore is conserved and wild life is allowed to flourish.  We intend to launch a major campaign in which government, local authorities and voluntary organisations will combine to produce a healthier, pleasanter Britain. We will vigorously pursue international agreements for the safeguarding and improvement of the environment. We will set clearly defined aims and target-dates for the achievement of cleaner air and rivers, and for the clearance of derelict land.  THE ARTS, BROADCASTING AND SPORT  We will continue to give full financial support and encouragement to the Arts. The Arts Council will be strengthened so that it can take a more active role in stimulating regional co-operation and in establishing effective regional arts associations. Local authorities will be encouraged to play a larger role in patronage of the Arts. We recognise the vital importance of private patronage. We will devote special attention to those areas of artistic life such as museums and music colleges which face particularly acute problems.  We believe that people are as entitled to an alternative radio service as to an alternative television service. We will permit local private enterprise radio under the general supervision of an independent broadcasting authority. Local institutions, particularly local newspapers, will have the opportunity of a stake in local radio, which we want to see closely associated with the local community.  We will ensure that the British Broadcasting Corporation continues to make its effective and essential public service contribution in both television and sound broadcasting. Equally, we will ensure that the independent television companies are not prevented from providing a responsible service by too high a government levy on their income.  The Sports Council is fulfilling an important function in carrying out research and advising the Government on capital investment in recreation by local authorities, and on grant-aid to voluntary organisations. We will make the Sports Council an independent body, and make it responsible for the grant-aiding functions at present exercised by the Government.  A STRONGER BRITAIN IN THE WORLD  If we can negotiate the right terms, we believe that it would be in the long-term interest of the British people for Britain to join the European Economic Community, and that it would make a major contribution to both the prosperity and the security of our country. The opportunities are immense. Economic growth and a higher standard of living would result from having a larger market.  But we must also recognise the obstacles. There would be short-term disadvantages in Britain going into the European Economic Community which must be weighed against the long-term benefits. Obviously there is a price we would not be prepared to pay. Only when we negotiate will it be possible to determine whether the balance is a fair one, and in the interests of Britain.  Our sole commitment is to negotiate; no more, no less. As the negotiations proceed we will report regularly through Parliament to the country.  A Conservative Government would not be prepared to recommend to Parliament, nor would Members of Parliament approve, a settlement which was unequal or unfair. In making  this judgement, Ministers and Members will listen to the views of their constituents and have in mind, as is natural and legitimate, primarily the effect of entry upon the standard of living of the individual citizens whom they represent.  We will stand by our alliances and strengthen our defences. We will continue to make our contribution to the forces of NATO and will seek to revitalise this organisation which is basic to the defence of Britain.  In the past, British forces in the Gulf, and in Singapore and Malaysia, have helped to ensure stability beneficial to the countries concerned and without which Britain's valuable interests would not have flourished. By unilaterally deciding to withdraw our forces from these areas by the end of 1971, the Labour Government have broken their promises to the Governments and peoples of these areas, and are exposing these British interests and the future of Britain's friends to unacceptable risk.  We have proposed a five-power defence force to help maintain peace and stability in South-East Asia. We will discuss this with our allies and Commonwealth friends - Australia, New Zealand, Malaysia and Singapore. Similar talks will be held with leaders in the Gulf.  We are satisfied that all these peacetime defence needs can be fulfilled by our Regular forces without the need for conscription. We deplore the destruction of the Territorial Army, and will provide adequate volunteer reserve forces for the defence and security of these islands.  We believe that Britain must in the last resort retain independent control of its nuclear weapons to deter an aggressor; as at present, those assigned to NATO can be withdrawn if supreme national interests are at stake.  We will foster the development of official and unofficial links within the Common wealth, believing that this unique organisation can be a force for peace and understanding. We believe that the independence of each of its members must be respected, and that their internal affairs and individual responsibilities are matters for their individual decision alone, and that jointly they should only consider those matters freely agreed upon as being of common interest.  We will give the United Nations full, constructive but not uncritical support. We will seek to build on its successes and to remedy its shortcomings. We intend to go on working for sound schemes of disarmament and arms control.  Labour has failed to solve the Rhodesian problem, to the detriment of all concerned. We will make a further effort to find a sensible and lust solution in accordance with the five principles which we have consistently maintained.  Britain must play a proper part in dealing with world poverty. We will ensure that Britain helps the developing countries:  - by working for the expansion of international trade;  - by encouraging private investment overseas;  - by providing capital aid and technical assistance to supplement their own efforts.  We have accepted the UNCTAD target for aid to developing countries, and will increase the British programme as national prosperity returns. We will re-examine the objectives and performance of the programme so that the maximum mutual advantage is gained.  THE CHOICE  The choice before the electors today is not just between policies and programmes. It is about the way of life our country shall follow in the next five years, and far beyond that.  In purely practical terms, it is a choice between another five years of the kind of incompetent, doctrinaire Government we have had for nearly six years and a new and better style of Government.  Faced with any problem, the instinctive Socialist reaction is to control, to restrict, and to tax. We aim to reduce the burden of taxation, and to extend individual choice, freedom and responsibility.  Socialists believe in the extension of the power of the State: government today is trying to do too much, managing too much, bringing too much to the centre for decision. We plan to clear away from Whitehall a great load of tasks which has accumulated under Socialism; to hand back responsibilities wherever we can to the individual, to the family, to private initiative, to the local authority, to the people.  It is also a choice between a Government which by its conduct has done much to discredit the value of the politician's word, and an alternative Government which is deter mined to restore honesty and integrity to political life.  Under a Conservative Government, the gap between the politician's promise and government performance will be closed, so that people and government can be brought together again in one nation united in a common purpose - a better tomorrow."
"Labour",197402,"Let us work together - Labour's way out of the crisis  FOREWORD  By Harold Wilson LEADER OF THE LABOUR PARTY  I welcome this Election - I welcome, more than anything else, this opportunity for the British people to give their verdict upon the last three years and eight months of Conservative Government. Let the people vote; let us work together again.  This Manifesto was published by the Labour Party National Executive Committee and Parliamentary Committee on 11 January last. Since then the situation has deteriorated gravely, and the nation knows it is in crisis. This is Labour's policy for that crisis-and to this we pledge ourselves when elected.  The Government called this election in panic. They are unable to govern, and dare not tell the people the truth.  Our people face a series of interlocking crises. Prices are rocketing. The Tories have brought the country to the edge of bankruptcy and breakdown. More and more people are losing their jobs. Firms are going out of business. Housing costs are out of reach for so many families. The Common Market now threatens us with still higher food prices and with a further loss of Britain's control of its own affairs. We shall restore to the British people the right to decide the final issue of British membership of the Common Market.  The British people were never consulted about the Market. Even more, the country was deceived in 1970 about the Government's intentions on jobs and prices. They will not be deceived again. Today the people of Britain know that reasonable leadership by Government can achieve an honourable settlement of the mining dispute and get the country back to work. Only stubborn refusal by an arrogant Conservative administration stands in our way.  The new Labour Government will see that the present dispute is settled by negotiation. We shall control prices and attack speculation and set a climate fair enough to work together with the unions.  This Election is not about the miners. They are in the firing line today. The housewife has been in the firing line ever since Mr. Heath was elected. Let us now choose a Government willing to face up to Britain's problems; let us elect a Government of all the people; let us work together.  HAROLD WILSON  Britain needs a new Government, and the Labour Party is ready with the policies essential to rescue the nation from the most serious political and economic crisis since 1945. We do not say that the dangers confronting us can be quickly dispelled; rising prices and housing costs and the new threat to our livelihood from the world-wide oil crisis cannot be held in check at a stroke. We do say that the problems cut so deep that the solutions must cut deep also. The sooner Labour gets the chance to heal the savage wounds inflicted upon our society in recent years, and to turn the hopes and exertions of our people in a new direction, the better for the nation as a whole.  In this sense, we face not merely economic perils of a new dimension; we face a crowning test of our democracy - whether we can show the resilience, the ingenuity, the courage, the imagination, the sense of community necessary to meet the economic perils.  The Labour Party is proud of the contribution we made to the nation's salvation at critical times in our history, and it is in the same mood that we approach the interlocking crises of the 1970s.  Immediately, for the vast majority of families, the economic crisis takes the form of fear for their jobs, ever-rising prices, particularly food prices, and ever-rising housing costs, particularly council rents and high mortgage rates, coupled with the most drastic cuts in their income which our people have experienced since the 1930s - caused by the three-day working week introduced in panic by Government decree on January 1. For the nation the economic crisis involves an appalling balance of payments deficit, mounting debt and an ever sinking pound.  Apparently, the aim of the Prime Minister is to continue the scourge of the three-day week until he has secured a political victory over the miners. He scolds them as national enemies at the very moment when their services are more than ever indispensable to the nation. The folly of this style of politics passes description. But one day soon the Government will have to make a settlement with the miners; let us hope the clash has not by then become so bitter that the long-term prospect of sustaining an effective coal industry is fatally impaired.  THE TORY LEGACY  The longer the Conservative Government survives the more desperate the situation a Labour Government will inherit. The British people will understand if we are then compelled to give so absolute a priority to rebuilding the economic fabric of the nation that some of our expenditure will have to be delayed. The graver our economic situation the more important it will be to protect the poorer members of the community - such as the pensioners - by a drastic re distribution of wealth and income. However, the nature of the crisis will require that the structural changes we propose should be made even more urgently.  Whatever the circumstances in which we take office, we shall still have to meet the menaces of the mounting price of oil, of a &pound;2,000 million deficit on the balance of payments, and of even more rapidly rising prices. How Labour will tackle that long-standing challenge of inflation naturally forms a central part of this document. But let us consider first the energy crisis.  THE ENERGY CRISIS  A huge addition is now being made to the price Britain must pay for oil from the Middle East and elsewhere, including heavy additional burdens on the balance of payments. Every available step must be taken to enforce the most efficient use of fuel and this must clearly be decided on a national scale. Government intervention in the allocation of precious energy resources would be willingly accepted by the community as a whole.  FIRST, and with the utmost urgency, the coal industry must be given a new status, perspective, and security. In particular, the case which the National Union of Mineworkers has long presented is now more than ever seen to be in the national interest. A Labour Government will give the mining industry the backing it needs to revise its plans on a more ambitious scale. Immediately, the present Government should set up a Commission, composed of representatives of the NCB, the NUM, and the Government itself, to re-examine the industry's future, including distribution, in the light of the new necessities, and to report within three months.  SECOND, the new situation has greatly strengthened Labour's determination to ensure not only that the North Sea and Celtic Sea oil and gas resources are in full public ownership, but that the operation of getting and distributing them is under full Government control with majority public participation. We cannot accept that the allocation of available world output should continue to be made by multi-national oil companies and not by Governments. We will not permit Britain's own resources to be parceled out in this way. It is public owner ship and control that will enable the British people, through its Government, to fix the pace of exploitation of our oil, and the use to which it is put, so as to secure maximum public advantage from our own resources.  THIRD, a British Government should take the initiative to set up an Inter national Energy Commission. Such a body, designed to establish a rational international allocation of available oil resources, together with research into new forms of fuel, should represent not only the industrialised nations but also the developing countries, which are bound to suffer most cruelly.  FOURTH, the energy crisis has further profound implications for the way we conduct our whole transport system. If we are to conserve precious fuel we must do two things: one, move as much traffic as possible from road to rail; and two, develop public transport to make us less dependent on the private car. This will involve large scale investment in railways, tubes and buses and a fares policy which puts the needs of the travelling public first.  FIFTH, the oil crisis is only one example of the problems which confront all nations in connection with the exploitation of the finite natural resources of raw materials of the earth. A Labour Government must co-operate internationally to use carefully the world's resources in the long-term public interest of both the developing and developed nations and to reject the present concepts of profiteering exploitation.  THE UNDERLYING CRISIS  Three years ago when Labour was in power, Britain had a big and growing surplus on the balance of payments. Mortgage rates stood at 8.5 per cent; Labour had built two million houses in six years; and the rise in the cost of living had been held down to less than S per cent a year. Today interest rates are at record high levels, and house building is at its lowest for more than ten years. The cost of living has gone up by 10 per cent a year and food prices have risen by no less than 18 per cent in one year.  The present Government came to office with promises of lower taxation, stable prices, reduced unemployment and increased financial strength. Three years later we have experienced a 20 per cent devaluation of the pound (or a 'float' downwards of that extent); unemployment has been over a million and is now rising again; prices have risen faster than at any time in living memory; and tax cuts for the rich have been paid for by price rises for the rest of us. We now have the lowest house building programme since 1963 combined with rampant inflation in rents and house prices. Wages are controlled whilst unearned incomes and capital values soar. The banks have doubled their profits through the record interest rates their customers have to pay. 1974 will certainly produce the biggest balance of payments deficit in our history.  THE COMMON MARKET  Britain is a European nation, and a Labour Britain would always seek a wider co-operation between the European peoples. But a profound political mistake  made by the Heath Government was to accept the terms of entry to the Common Market, and to take us in without the consent of the British people. This has involved the imposition of food taxes on top of rising world prices, crippling fresh burdens on our balance of payments, and a draconian curtailment of the power of the British Parliament to settle questions affecting vital British interests. This is why a Labour Government will immediately seek a fundamental re negotiation of the terms of entry.  We have spelled out in Labour's Programme for Britain our objectives in the new negotiations which must take place:  'The Labour Party opposes British membership of the European Communities on the terms negotiated by the Conservative Government.  'We have said that we are ready to re-negotiate.  'In preparing to re-negotiate the entry terms, our main objectives are these:  'Major changes in the COMMON AGRICULTURAL POLICY, so that it ceases to be a threat to world trade in food products, and so that low-cost producers outside Europe can continue to have access to the British food market.  'New and fairer methods of financing the COMMUNITY BUDGET. Neither the taxes that form the so-called ""own resources"" of the Communities, nor the purposes, mainly agricultural support, on which the funds are mainly to be spent, are acceptable to us. We would be ready to contribute to Community finances only such sums as were fair in relation to what is paid and what is received by other member countries.  'As stated earlier, we would reject any kind of international agreement which compelled us to accept increased unemployment for the sake of maintaining a fixed parity, as is required by current proposals for a European ECONOMIC AND MONETARY UNION. We believe that the monetary problems of the European countries can be resolved only in a world-wide framework.  'The retention by PARLIAMENT of those powers over the British economy needed to pursue effective regional, industrial and fiscal policies. Equally we need an agreement on capital movements which protects our balance of payments and full employment policies. The economic interests of the COMMONWEALTH and the DEVELOPING COUNTRIES must be better safeguarded This involves securing continued access to the British market and, more generally, the adoption by an enlarged Community of trade and aid policies designed to benefit not just ""associated overseas territories"" in Africa, but developing countries throughout the world.  'No harmonisation of VALUE ADDED TAX which would require us to tax necessities.  'If re-negotiations are successful, it is the policy of the Labour Party that, in view of the unique importance of the decision, the people should have the right to decide the issue through a General Election or a Consultative Referendum. If these two tests are passed, a successful renegotiation and the expressed approval of the majority of the British people, then we shall be ready to play our full part in developing a new and wider Europe.  'If re-negotiations do not succeed, we shall not regard the Treaty obligations as binding upon us. We shall then put to the British people the reasons why we find the new terms unacceptable, and consult them on the advisability of negotiating our withdrawal from the Communities.'  An incoming Labour Government will immediately set in train the procedures designed to achieve an early result and whilst the negotiations proceed and until the British people have voted, we shall stop further processes of integration, particularly as they affect food taxes. The Government will be free to take decisions, subject to the authority of Parliament, in cases where decisions of the Common Market prejudge the negotiations. Thus, the right to decide the final issue of British entry into the Market will be restored to the British people.  SOCIAL JUSTICE  Clearly, a fresh approach to the British crisis is required, and Labour insists that it must begin with an entirely new recognition of the claims of social justice.  To that end, urgent action is needed to tackle rising prices; to strike at the roots of the worst poverty; to make the country demonstrably a much  fairer place to live in. For these purposes, a new Labour Government, in its first period of office, will:  1 Bring immediate help to existing PENSIONERS, widows, the sick and the unemployed by increasing pensions and other benefits to &pound;10 for the single person and &pound;16 for the married couple, within the first Parliamentary session of our Government. Thereafter these figures will be increased annually in proportion to increases in average national earnings. We shall also follow this by replacing the Conservative Government's inadequate and unjust long- term pensions scheme by a comprehensive scheme designed to take future pensioners off the means test and give full equality of treatment to women.  2 Introduce a new scheme of help for the DISABLED.  3 Help the low paid and other families in poverty by introducing a new system of CHILD CASH ALLOWANCES for every child, including the first, payable to the mother.  4 Introduce strict PRICE CONTROL on key services and commodities. Bulk purchase and new marketing arrangements will help stabilise food prices, and selective use of subsidies will be applied to the items bearing most heavily on the family budget. We shall re-negotiate those elements of Common Market policy which deliberately impose food taxes on the people.  5 Repeal the HOUSING FINANCE ACT, and give back to local authorities the right to fix rents which do not make a profit out of their tenants. We shall extend protection from eviction to tenants of furnished accommodation; limit rent increases in unfurnished and furnished lettings; encourage the municipalisation of privately rented property (except where an owner-occupier shares a house with a tenant); and take steps to secure a steady supply of mortgage funds at reasonable rates of interest to those wishing to buy their own homes; and abolish the agricultural tied cottage. We shall raise the total subsidy for local authority house building to that granted to owner- occupiers on their mortgage payments. This will be vital to reversing the serious fall in the housing programme under the present Government.  Land required for development will be taken into public ownership, so that land is freely and cheaply available for new houses, schools, hospitals and other purposes. Public ownership of land will stop land profiteering. It will emphatically not apply to owner-occupiers.  6 REDISTRIBUTE INCOME AND WEALTH. We shall introduce an annual Wealth Tax on the rich; bring in a new tax on major transfers of personal wealth; heavily tax speculation in property - including a new tax on property companies; and seek to eliminate tax dodging across the whole field.  INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS  These measures affecting prices and taxation policy will prove by deeds the determination of the new Labour Government to set Britain on the road towards a new social and economic equality. After so many failures in the field of incomes policy - under the Labour Government but even more seriously under the Tory Government's compulsory wage controls - only deeds can persuade. Only practical action by the Government to create a much fairer distribution of the national wealth can convince the worker and his family and his trade union that 'an incomes policy' is not some kind of trick to force him, particularly if he works in a public service or nationalised industry, to bear the brunt of the national burden. But as it is proved that the Government is ready to act - against high prices, rents and other impositions falling most heavily on the low paid and on pensioners - so we believe that the trade unions voluntarily (which is the only way it can be done for any period in a free society), will co-operate to make the whole policy successful. We believe that the action we propose on prices, together with an understanding with the TUC on the lines which we have already agreed, will create the right economic climate for money incomes to grow in line with production. That is the essence of the new social contract which the Labour Party has discussed at length and agreed with the TUC and which must take its place as a central feature of the new economic policy of a Labour Government.  A Labour Government will, therefore:  (i) Abolish the PAY BOARD apparatus set up by the Tories  (ii) Repeal the INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS ACT as a matter of extreme urgency and then bring in an Employment Protection Act and an Industrial Democracy Act, as agreed in our discussions with the TUC, to increase the control of industry by the people  (iii) Establish a standing ROYAL COMMISSION to advise on income distribution, both earned and unearned, with particular reference to differentials and job evaluation  (iv) Establish a non-governmental CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION SERVICE, with the task of tackling industrial disputes at both national and local level.  EMPLOYMENT AND EXPANSION  However, more will be needed if we are to create A new spirit in industry. The British people, both as workers and consumers, must have more control over the powerful private forces that at present dominate our economic life. To this end we shall:  7 Sustain and expand industrial development and exports and bring about the re-equipment necessary for this purpose through the powers we shall take in a new INDUSTRY ACT and through the Planning Agreement system which will allow Government to plan with industry more effectively.  Wherever we give direct aid to a company out of public funds we shall in return reserve the right to take a share of the ownership of the company.  8 In addition to our plans set out in point S above for taking into common ownership land required for development, we shall substantially extend PUBLIC ENTERPRISE by taking mineral rights. We shall also take shipbuilding, shiprepairing and marine engineering, ports, the manufacture of airframes and aeroengines into public ownership and control. But we shall not confine the extension of the public sector to the loss-making and subsidised industries. We shall also take over profitable sections or individual firms in those industries where a public holding is essential to enable the Government to control prices, stimulate investment, encourage exports, create employment, protect workers and consumers from the activities of irresponsible multi-national companies, and to plan the national economy in the national interest. We shall therefore include in this operation, sections of pharmaceuticals, road haulage, construction, machine tools, in addition to our proposals for North Sea and Celtic Sea oil and gas. Our decision in the field of banking, insurance and building societies is still under consideration. We shall return to public ownership assets and licences hived-off by the present government, and we shall create a powerful National Enterprise Board with the structure and functions set out in Labour's Programme 1973.   9 We intend to socialise existing nationalised industries. In consultation with the unions, we shall take steps to make the management of existing nationalised industries more responsible to the workers in the industry and more responsive to their consumers' needs.  10 Regional development will be further encouraged by new public enterprise, assistance to private industry on a selective basis, and new REGIONAL PLANNING MACHINERY, along the lines set out in Labour's Programme 1973. We will retain and improve the Regional Employment Premium. Revenues from North Sea oil will be used wherever possible to improve employment conditions in Scotland and the regions elsewhere in need of development.  11 We shall develop an active manpower policy with a powerful NATIONAL LABOUR BOARD. In the longer term, redundant workers must have an automatic right to retraining; redundancy should then lead not to unemployment, but to retraining and job changing.  SOCIAL PROGRESS  These are our measures for transforming British industry into a responsible economic system. It is outrageous that, at a time when enormous private wealth is being accumulated, so little effort has been made to maintain and improve our public services. A Labour Government will:  12 Revise and expand the NATIONAL HEALTH SERVICE; abolish prescription charges; introduce free family planning; phase out private practice from the hospital service; and transform the area health authorities into democratic bodies.  We also intend to establish a disability benefit.  13 Expand the EDUCATION SERVICE by the introduction of a national scheme of Nursery Schools, including day care facilities, and by a big expansion of educational facilities for 16-18 year olds, by finally ending the 11+ and by providing additional resources for children in special need of help. We shall speed the development of a universal system of fully comprehensive secondary schools. All forms of tax-relief and charitable status for public schools will be withdrawn.  14 Pay special attention to the MANPOWER NEEDS of all public services now approaching breakdown, particularly in our inner urban areas. Our cities desperately need and must get better services, which are properly manned, and the resources to make this possible.  Not all of our proposals should be judged on economic tests. It is the duty of Socialists to protect the individual from discrimination on whatever grounds. Here several of our proposals have the advantage of bringing benefits at little economic cost.  15 WOMEN AND GIRLS must have an equal status in education, training, employment, social security, national insurance, taxation, property ownership, matrimonial and family law. Women at work, whether wives and mothers or those otherwise caring for dependent relatives, must receive more consideration from the community. We shall create the powerful legal machinery necessary to enforce our anti-discrimination laws.  16 Review the law of NATIONALITY so that our immigration policies are based on citizenship, and in particular to eliminate discrimination on grounds of colour.  17 Set up a NATIONAL CONSUMERS AUTHORITY with adequate finance to redress the balance between the consumer and the manufacturer and seller.  PEACE AND JUSTICE IN A SAFER WORLD  As in domestic policy the lesson of the last few years in Foreign Policy is that a narrow, selfish, inward looking approach to international problems is doomed to failure. We are, more than ever, one world and Labour's foreign policy will be dedicated to the strengthening of international institutions and global co operation in response to the threats to the peace and prosperity of us all. To this end the foreign policy of a new Labour Government will be guided by four main principles.  ONE We shall seek to strengthen international organisations dedicated to the promotion of human rights. the rule of law, and the peaceful settlement of disputes. In particular, we shall re-dedicate Britain to the ideals of the United Nations and the Commonwealth, two organisations treated with scant regard by the present Government.  TWO We shall commit Britain to a policy of equality at home and abroad which would involve radical changes in aid, trade and development policies. In particular, the next Labour Government will seek to implement the United Nations Development Target of 0.7 per cent of GNP official aid and will increase the aid programme to meet it, and will actively seek to re-establish a more generous and more liberal world trading pattern for the developing countries.  THREE We shall oppose all forms of racial discrimination and colonialism. This will mean support for the liberation movements of Southern Africa and a disengagement from Britain's unhealthy involvement with Apartheid. We shall intensify the policy of sanctions against Rhodesia and agree to no settlement which does not have the whole-hearted consent of the African majority.  FOUR Whilst maintaining our support for NATO as an instrument of détente no less than of defence, we shall, in consultation with our Allies, progressively reduce the burden of Britain's defence spending to bring our costs into line with those carried by our main European allies. Such a realignment would, at pre sent levels of defence spending, mean savings on defence expenditure by Britain of several hundred million pounds per annum over a period. At the same time we shall work for the success of détente. We shall participate in the multilateral disarmament negotiations and as a first step will seek the removal of American Polaris bases from Great Britain. The ultimate objective of the movement to wards a more satisfactory relationship in Europe must be the mutual and concurrent phasing out of NATO and the Warsaw Pact.  LET THE NATION DECIDE  The aims set out in this manifesto are Socialist aims, and we are proud of the word. It is only by setting our aims high, even amid the hazards of our present economic situation, that the idealism and high intelligence, especially of our young people, can be enlisted. It is indeed our intention to:  (a) Bring about a fundamental and irreversible shift in the balance of power and wealth in favour of working people and their families  (b) Eliminate poverty wherever it exists in Britain, and commit ourselves to a substantial increase in our contribution to fight poverty abroad  (c) Make power in industry genuinely accountable to the workers and the community at large  (d) Achieve far greater economic equality - in income, wealth and living standards  (e) Increase social equality by giving far greater importance to full employment, housing, education and social benefits  (f) Improve the environment in which our people live and work and spend their leisure.  Of course, as we insisted at the beginning, these aims, like the particular items In the programme, cannot all be fulfilled at once. We cannot do everything at once, and these are the priorities we have chosen. This preliminary manifesto, drawing upon the new policy statements which the Labour Party has discussed by its democratic process, over the past three years, sets out the specific numbered pledges which the next Labour Government will seek with all its strength to carry out in a single Parliament.  The task will not be easy. But we repudiate the despairing gospel preached In some quarters that the British people cannot govern themselves and that they have lost the art to act cohesively, through their various democratic institutions, as a civilised community.  That charge comes most insultingly from a Conservative Government which has adopted so many devices to corrode or destroy the power of those democratic institutions - local authorities, the trade unions, the House of Commons itself. These are the very instruments which Labour will use to restore and enhance the power of British democracy."
NA,197402,"'Change the face of Britain'  THE CRISIS OF GOVERNMENT  This country has seen two parties, Labour and Conservative, alternating in office during the last fifty years. For the last five years, both parties have had to deal with very similar problems; both have offered similar solutions; both, in Opposition have opposed the policies of their opponents and then adopted them on becoming the Government. In 1967 Labour in office introduced a compulsory policy of prices and incomes control which the Conservatives, in opposition, opposed vehemently. At the same time the Labour Party re-opened negotiations for Britain's entry into the Common Market and these negotiations concluded with the offer of terms of entry which were accepted by Labour in 1969. In 1969, the Labour Government also introduced its White Paper 'In Place of Strife' which advocated legislation to control Industrial Relations. The Conservative opposition opposed this measure. When the Conservatives returned to office in 1970 they immediately introduced the Industrial Relations Act which was bitterly opposed by Labour, despite the fact that many of the provisions for union registration and protection of employment had been in their own proposals. When the Conservative Government in early 1971 elected to join the Common Market on terms which Mr. Roy Jenkins asserted were similar to those negotiated by the Labour Government, Labour opposed entry. Finally, having persistently opposed compulsory prices and incomes control, the Conservative Government did one more U-turn and introduced its own pay and price freeze in 1972 to be followed by Phase II and Phase III. Once more the Labour opposition stood on its head and opposed what had formerly been its own policy.  A CRISIS OF CONFIDENCE  Britain cannot be governed effectively when parties continuously change their policies and principles to make cheap political gains and without regard for their own principles or for public opinion. The crisis of inconsistent government has led to a crisis of public confidence in the two parties which have ruled this country for the last fifty years. Liberals refuse to accept that the present crisis is induced by any one political party, Tory or Labour. It is caused by the type of policies and politics which both parties espouse; policies which employ short term, instant cures, but which leave behind more problems than they solve; politics which are partisan, dividing and polarising the nation into confrontation between classes whether they be rich or poor, manager or worker, house owner or tenant. This country cannot be ruled from the extremes of right and left which set the people against each other - it must be run by a government whose neutrality is unquestioned, whose policies are fair-minded, and whose politics is not governed by vested interests.  A NEW TYPE OF POLITICS  Politics has become sterile; the old two-party system has finally proved its inadequacy. Old political theories of unbridled free enterprise and undiluted socialism have been shown to be irrelevant. Even leading members of the Conservative and Labour Parties admit that their own administrations have failed to deal with our fundamental problems and yet they hang on limply to political power. Politics has gone away from the people and this, in a democracy, is the most dangerous development of recent years.  The Liberal Party's concern for the individual person expressed in our 'Community Politics' campaigns has been criticised by the old-fashioned politicians as the politics of the paving stone. Yet they forget that politics is fundamentally about people, and their problems - however trivial they may seem - should dominate the minds of all politicians. Liberals believe in the supremacy of the  individual and that political institutions should serve, not enslave, the people. Fundamentally Community Politics is an attempt to involve people in the decisions that affect their daily lives at the time when the individual viewpoint can really be expressed effectively - not six months after the decision has been reached, through a futile protest or enquiry. Our policies to decentralise government; to democratise the vast bureaucracies which run our Education system, our Industrial Relations and our Health and Welfare services, are all designed to further the goal of 'people participation'.  A NEW PARTY  But a party which seeks to transform the politics and administration of Britain must itself be organised in such a way as to avoid the pitfalls of compromise partisanship and inconsistency which have befallen parties in the past. The Liberal Party is a party of no vested interest - financial or individual. Opinion Polls have consistently shown that we draw our support almost equally from all sections of the population, whichever way it is divided up, and that between 40 and 50 per cent of the people at any given time would vote for the Liberal Party if they thought that a Liberal Government would be elected. Our five by-election victories have indicated that many people feel that the time has come for a Liberal Government.  Unlike the other two parties we draw on no permanent source of financial support, while the Conservative Party consistently draws on at least a million pounds per year from the vested interests of big business, and Labour relies on the vested interests of the Trade Unions for over 90 per cent of its election funds. Is it any wonder that the country is polarised by Tory-Labour confrontation?  The Liberal Party is tied to no sectional interest. That is why we can justly claim that we approach the problems of our country with no doctrinaire prejudices, no class inhibitions and no sectional interests.  NEW POLICIES - A RADICAL PROGRAMME OF RECONSTRUCTION  Most of all, the present crisis demands fundamental changes in the policies which we adopt. The old values which have led to inequalities in wealth, property and power must go. Government must be seen to be acting fairly in the interests of all the people instead of the interests of the very few. We must set aside the sterile class conflicts, the debates about capitalism or socialism, and the policies that divide and weaken us as a nation. We must rigidly question any new initiative by asking the question: 'will it narrow the gulf between the classes; will it reduce conflict?' No policy will achieve any lasting progress without national acceptance. Until we achieve the ideal of national unity, any other policy aims to achieve economic growth or industrial efficiency, will be unattainable. What is therefore needed is a fearless programme of economic, social and industrial reconstruction and a clearout of the old values which have so dogged the progress of the nation.  LIBERAL POLICY AIMS  1 Establish the universal right to a _minimum income_ balanced by a fairer _distribution of wealth,_ through a credit income tax system and national minimum earnings guarantees. 2 Create an equal _partnership_ between employers and employed in recognition of the equal importance of their contributions to the success of industry. 3 _Decentralise_ government and bring political power to Scotland, Wales and the regions of England so as to ensure that decisions are taken as close to people as possible. 4 Involve people in exerting influence within their communities through _participation;_ and encourage proper consultation in the exercise of national responsibilities for Health, Education and General Welfare. 5 _Break-up_ monopolistic concentrations of political and economic power so that individual initiative is not suppressed. _6 Conserve and protect_ finite resources for the lasting benefit of the whole community.  All these aims have one end; to serve the individual and to create the conditions in which he can develop his personality to the full.  THE LONG TERM CRISIS  Since the War, politicians, business leaders, trade unionists and journalists have all assumed that a high economic growth rate is desirable and have encouraged expectations that put a premium on the acquisition of more money to spend on material goods. But the pursuit of unlimited growth has been accompanied by soaring prices, high unemployment and high domestic demand which has led to recurring balance of payments crises. The usual remedy adopted by Tory and Labour Governments has been 'stop go' - boom followed by freeze and squeeze.  The Wilson and Heath Governments have even acted similarly - and mistakenly - in either holding out against devaluation of the pound until world pressure forced an uncontrolled devaluation, or holding on to a mistaken belief in the importance of maintaining our balance of payments at the expense of rising unemployment, which finally reached the million mark in early 1972.  The result of these policies has been the frustration of targets unreached and the deception of unfulfilled promises, as the following examples illustrate:  VALUE OF THE POUND  _Labour 1964-1970_  'Devaluation does not mean of course that the &pound; here in Britain, in your pocket, or purse, or in your bank has been devalued.'  _Harold Wilson TV Broadcast November 19, 1967_  REALITY IN SIX YEARS OF LABOUR GOVERNMENT THE &POUND; LOST NEARLY 20 PER CENT OF ITS VALUE.  _Conservative 1970-1974_  'We have become resigned to the value of the &pound; in our pockets or purses falling by at least a shilling a year.'  REALITY THE &POUND; OF JUNE 1970 DROPPED IN VALUE TO 75P (OR ABOUT 15/- IN PRE-DECIMAL TERMS) IN JANUARY 1974 (HOUSE OF COMMONS QUESTION/ANSWER), A DROP OF WELL OVER A SHILLING A YEAR.  UNEMPLOYMENT  _Labour 1964-1970_  'We see no reason why unemployment should rise at all, apart from seasonal increases.'  _Harold Wilson (Labour Party Press Conference March 29, 1966)_  REALITY IN SIX YEARS OF LABOUR GOVERNMENT BRITAIN EXPERIENCED THE MOST PROLONGED PERIOD OF HIGH UNEMPLOYMENT SINCE 1940. FOR THREE-QUARTERS OF THIS PERIOD THE NUMBER OF UNEMPLOYED WAS OVER HALF A MILLION!  _Conservative 1970-1974_  'If we could get back to Tory policies, the unemployment position would be a great deal better than it is today.'  _Robert Carr, May 6, 1971_  'We accept absolutely the responsibility for the level of unemployment.'  _Robert Carr November 23, 1971_  REALITY DURING 1971 AND 1972 UNEMPLOYED WAS RUNNING AT RECORD WAR LEVELS. UNEMPLOYMENT AVERAGED 758,000 (3.3 PER CENT OF WORKING POPULATION) IN 1971, AND 84,000 (3.7 PER CENT OF WORKING POPULATION) IN 1972.  COST OF LIVING  _Labour 1964-1970_  'The continual rise in the cost of living can, must, and will be halted to give the housewife relief and her family a genuine rise in their standard of living.' _George Brown, Swadlingcote September 27,1964_  REALITY IN JUST OVER LIVE YEARS UNDER THE LABOUR GOVERNMENT PRICES ROSE BY 25 PER CENT.  _Conservative 1970-1974 _'In implementing our policies we will give overriding priority to bringing the present inflation under control.' _Conservative Manifesto June 1970 _REALITY RETAIL PRICES HAVE RISEN BY OVER 33 PER CENT SINCE THE 1970 ELECTION. FOOD PRICES BY NEARLY 50 PER CENT (DEPT. OF EMPLOYMENT INDEX OF RETAIL PRICES, DECEMBER, 1973).  STATUTORY WAGE CONTROL _Labour 1964-1970 _'As to the idea of freezing all wage claims, salary claims . . . I think this would be monstrously unfair . . . I do not think you can ever legislate for wage increases, and no party is setting out to do that.' _Harold Wilson BBC Election Forum March 10, 1966 _REALITY FOUR MONTHS LATER MEASURES WERE TAKEN TO FREEZE WAGES AND PRICES UNTIL THE END OF 1966, FOLLOWED BY 6 MONTHS OF 'SEVERE RESTRAINT'. _Conservative 1970-1974 _'Labour's compulsory wage control was a failure and we will not repeat it.' _Conservative Manifesto June 1970 _REALITY A COMPULSORY PRICE AND WAGE FREEZE WAS INTRODUCED BY THE CONSERVATIVES IN NOVEMBER 1972, FOLLOWED QUICKLY BY PHASE II AND CULMINATING IN THE CRISIS OF PHASE III. HOUSING _Labour 1964-1970 _We have embarked on a massive expansion of the housing programme reaching by 1970 no less than 500,000 new dwellings. This is not a lightly given promise, it is a pledge.' _Harold Wilson (Election Speech) Bradford March 27, 1966 _REALITY IT WAS ABANDONED IN JANUARY LESS THAN TWO YEARS LATER. IN 1970 LESS THAN 365,000 NEW HOUSES WERE BUILT, FEWER THAN THE 373,000 BUILT IN 1964. _Conservative 1970-1974 _'It is scandalous that this year (1970), as last year, fewer houses will be completed than in 1964 when Labour took over. And far fewer are under construction.' _Conservative Manifesto June 1970 _REALITY THIS GOVERNMENT COMPLETED ONLY 293,000 IN 1973, THE LOWEST NUMBER SINCE 1959, AND ON CURRENT TRENDS THEY WILL AGAIN FAIL TO ACHIEVE 300,000 IN 1974. THE QUALITY OF LIFE In addition, the damage to the fabric of society and the environment as a result of the pursuit of unlimited growth has been enormous. To the extent that growth has been achieved, it has not increased human happiness. Instead there has been evidence of increased social disintegration to which the growth in crime, mental illness, drug taking and divorce all testify. Furthermore, the destruction of whole communities in the interest of 'redevelopment', the scarring of the landscape by motorways and the shattering noise of jets over rooftops near major airports are a few of the more obvious symptoms of incompatibility between unlimited material growth and the good life. THE LIBERAL STRATEGY Whether or not continued expansion is desirable, we now have to ask if it is indefinitely feasible. The Liberal Party believes that we now have to begin planning for an age of stability. The resources of this planet are limited and we shall not be able to go on increasing consumption of energy, raw materials and foodstuffs at current rates. The steep rises in world commodity prices and the restrictions imposed by the producer nations on oil supplies, are strong indications of a turning point in history, the significance of which has yet to be grasped by most politicians.  We must therefore act on two fronts to cut back on demand for our limited resources, firstly by effectively controlling domestic inflation which is causing intense pressure on our balance of payments and adding to the chaos of our industrial relations as well as preventing the development of long-term economic and social policies.  But secondly, we must now abandon the policy adopted by past Governments, based, almost entirely, on the crude maximisation of Gross National Product. GNP is not a measure of real benefit, including, as it does, outputs that are good, bad and indifferent, and to talk simply of unlimited increases in growth is to deprive people of the power to choose between the beneficial and the harmful.  Liberals advocate a policy of controlled economic growth, by which we mean the careful husbandry of resources and the limitation of private consumption by the few in favour of better public services for the majority of our citizens.  In terms of human resources a policy of controlled economic growth also recognises that the obligation to provide employment and a safe environment can no longer be sacrificed to the maximisation of industrial efficiency. People cannot be treated as 'lame ducks'.  INFLATION - THE PRESENT CRISIS  The major single problem facing the next Government will be that of inflation. Given the long-term crisis of resources which we face it is unlikely that inflation will ever be completely conquered but it can be controlled with determined and fair policies which have the support of the people. Conservatives and Labour Governments have pandered to vested interests to the detriment of the population as a whole. Both have been fearful of embarking on long-term policies to control the economy and attack inflation for fear of denting the profits of the big corporations and the wage packets of the strongest unions. Hence their timid attempts at controlling inflation have been undercut by promises of an ultimate return to a free for all.  Liberals would control inflation through a combination of industrial reconstruction and a permanent prices and incomes policy enforced by penalties on those whose actions cause inflation. We propose that prices, dividends and average earnings within a company should be limited to an agreed annual rate of increase. Any company which increased prices faster than that rate would suffer an extra surcharge on its Corporation Tax payments equivalent to the amount by which its prices had exceeded the agreed norm. Excessive dividends and profits pay-outs would also be penalised by a tax surcharge, on a sliding scale according to the amount by which such increases exceed the norm.  If average earnings per person (including fringe benefits) within a company rose faster than the agreed annual rate, then both the employer and the employees concerned would have to pay an extra surcharge on their graduated National Insurance Contributions, again on a sliding scale according to the amount by which earnings had exceeded the norm.  Of course, there would have to be provision for appeal and this would be best achieved by the compilation of _ad hoc_ reports on earnings levels and pricing policies in particular industries along the lines of the old National Board for Prices and Incomes. Such reports would also cover changes in relativities and wage differentials, which will have to be narrowed considerably, and Parliamentary consent would have to be obtained before reports could be implemented.  Thus instead of countering inflation by increasing everybody's taxes, as Mr. Powell and the Labour Party advocate, Liberals would tax only those who cause inflation and would control the supply of money into the economy without having to resort to the blunt instrument of brutal cuts in expenditure on social services which once again hit the poor hardest of all.  A great merit of this policy is that it would enable wage bargaining to take place without direct government intervention and inevitable accusations of partisanship. Yet it would still enable the Government to maintain overall control of the economy. But no policy can hope to succeed unless it is accepted and seen as fair by the great majority of people. Two major defects in past policies must be remedied if this policy is to succeed: the unfairness of the present wage bargaining system which favours those who shout loudest must be ended, and a fairer pricing policy must be evolved to ensure that price increases do not merely contribute to increased profits.  FAIR PRICES  Liberals would strengthen price controls by relating them to absolute rather than percentage margins. We would also insist that middle-sized companies were obliged to submit applications to increase prices, as are top companies. We would strengthen the powers of the Monopoly and Mergers Commission to investigate and regulate monopoly companies. The Government must stimulate competition where it can still be made to work, break up and control monopolies, prevent non-productive mergers and stamp out widespread restrictive practices. Nationalisation will not solve the problem of high prices or monopolies. As we have seen in so many nationalised industries, the public either has to suffer high prices or subsidise non-profit-making industries. Either way the consumer pays more.  But in the meantime, where there are rapid increases in prices which are beyond the Government's control, Liberals favour the incorporation of guaranteed wage increases into any agreed pay policy to allow compensation for any excessive rise in food prices which occurs. With food prices having risen by fifty per cent in three-and-a-half years such action is now required immediately.  A NATIONAL MINIMUM EARNINGS LEVEL  We must work to narrow the differentials between the highest and lowest paid IN OUR economy. AT A time when average earnings have reached over &pound;40 a week, six million working people still earn less than half of this sum. A Liberal Government would introduce a statutory minimum earnings level for a normal working week and no employer would be allowed to pay less than this amount.  The importance of such legislation has been starkly illustrated by the three-day week. Those who suffered most in reduced wages and redundancies have been the poor - precisely those who do not have earnings guarantees.  But we must also reform the wage bargaining free-for-all in which the poorest inevitably come off worst. To do this effectively we must reconstruct our frame work of industrial relations to spread the monopoly power now vested in a few very powerful Unions.  A NEW CHARTER FOR INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS  Britain lost more than 24 million working days last year - more than any other European country and almost double the amount lost in Italy, our nearest rival. Yet what have our opponents to offer as an antidote to industrial chaos? The Industrial Relations Act and the impotent Industrial Relations Court stand as monuments to attempted Tory repression, and a perpetual reminder to the Labour Party of its capitulation to Union pressure while in Government. Whatever the merits of the Act's provisions for contractual obligation and redundancy protection its practical effectiveness has foundered on Union opposition and Conservative folly. The dues which were expropriated from the AUEW political fund were drops in the ocean, but the action which confiscated money earmarked for the Government's opponents, was a devastating piece of party political warfare.  The Industrial Relations Act must be repealed and replaced by far-reaching legislation to introduce real democracy into industry. The Labour Party talks glibly about Industrial Democracy by which it means Union domination and the effective exclusion of over fifty per cent of our work force which does not belong to a union. The Liberal Party believes that _all_ individuals should be involved in the industry in which they work and this has been the cornerstone of our policy for over fifty years. We believe that the two-party system in Britain based on a party of organised capital confronting a party of organised labour has helped to divide industry into two camps to the detriment of the community as a whole. We therefore advocate industrial partnership not merely as an aid in solving the economic problems of our country, but as a system which is right and just, and which will unite instead of dividing.  Liberal industrial policy has three objectives. Firstly, employees must become members of their companies just as shareholders are, with the same clearly defined rights. Secondly, it must be accepted that directors in public companies  are equally responsible to shareholders and employees. Employees should be entitled to share in the election of the directors on equal terms with shareholders, and Works Councils representing all employees must be set up at plant level with wide powers to negotiate pay and conditions of work. Thirdly, employees should share in the profits of the company and the growth of its assets.  In the long term, the implementation of Liberal co-partnership policies will contribute to the solution of wage inflation, by ensuring that all employees benefit from wage increases and by including a measure of responsibility into wage bargaining. For in the day-to-day negotiations within each company employees would realise that there is little to be gained by wage increases in excess of productivity. Such increases would simply reduce the amount available in which the workers would share. In short our policies would achieve the identification of employees' interests with those of the firm by providing a visible link between the immediate limitation of wage demands and the future prosperity which will be generated for both employees and shareholders as a result. We cannot believe that any reasonable employer would prefer an industrial strike and the loss of millions of pounds to the hope of industrial harmony and responsible wage bargaining through industrial partnership. Similarly, no responsible employee would refuse the opportunity to become an equal partner in his firm with an equal share in its profits in favour of continued confrontation, inequality and insecurity.  THE ENERGY CRISIS  The short-term problems caused by the miners' industrial action and the interruption of Middle East oil supplies demanded immediate action to reduce consumption, and in the main the Liberals supported Government restrictions in the use of energy and the three-day week, both of which we were convinced were necessary to avoid even more serious disruption of economic life as stocks would otherwise have fallen below the danger level. However, we have been critical of the inflexibility of the Government's anti-inflation policy, which prevented the National Coal Board from entering into proper negotiation on the miners' claim. Instead of being recognised as the life blood of a nation now deprived of a large portion of its energy supplies, the miners were made the scapegoat for the Government's obstinacy in clinging to out-dated policies. Any settlement with the miners must be permanent and ensure continuing reward for their contribution to the alleviation of the Energy Crisis. We believe that a settlement could have been reached if, in addition to the increases offered under Phase III, the NCB could have undertaken to make further rises available as the industry expands.  All political parties, including the Liberals, must share the blame for the decline in coal output since the middle sixties. In order to reverse the decline, the NCB should be encouraged to press ahead with the development of new coal reserves in Yorkshire and the Midlands.  The Government's policy of exploiting North Sea Oil and Gas must be done at a rate determined by a National Energy Policy so as to allow indigenous industries to acquire the necessary expertise and equipment. The policy must also have regard to the longer-term future when imports of hydrocarbons are likely to be even more expensive and difficult to obtain. Royalties from the production of North Sea oil should be used in part to encourage the development of other industries in Scotland and the North East - and later, if exploration in the Celtic Sea is successful, in Wales. We are not satisfied that the revenues accruing to the nation from our own oil are fair in relation to the latest assessments of the size and value of the fields, and Liberals will ensure that huge windfall profits are not made by the licensees, many of whom are foreign concerns who have been given licences on exorbitantly advantageous terms.  The Liberal Party advocates continuity of work on British nuclear reactor systems. The first advanced gas-cooled reactors will come into operation during 1974, and it would be a grave mistake to switch horses now to the American pressurised water reactor system, as it is suggested we are likely to do. The evidence from the United States shows that they are less safe. But energy policy should not consist solely of adjusting supply to meet whatever demand is created by existing market forces. Governments can influence demand as well as supply by pricing policy, incentives and capital projects. At a time when public spending on education, housing and health is being cut, it is not acceptable to press on with the &pound;3,000 million projected expenditure on Concorde, Maplin and the Channel Tunnel simultaneously, quite apart from energy and environmental considerations. Since, however, air travel will become far more expensive as jet fuel increases in cost, Maplin is no longer necessary, and the airlines will not buy Concorde, the former should be scrapped and the latter severely curtailed. Similarly, fewer people will be able to afford Continental motoring holidays with petrol at &pound;1 a gallon, as predicted by Lord Stokes, and the Channel Tunnel should therefore be rail only, saving &pound;240 million. These are all complex problems, and it cannot be denied that we have been caught unprepared by recent changes in the energy situation. The importance of the matter has been recognised implicitly by the Government, in the creation of a separate Department responsible for energy, but there is still no authoritative body to give impartial advice to both Government and Parliament. We need a permanent Royal Commission, serviced by adequate professional staff and with funds to commission research by industry, universities and government research establishments. This body would be required to publish reports at regular intervals, the first of which should be on the long-term proposals in the coal industry. Such reports should then be debated in Parliament.  Finally, the Government's long-term plan to reorganise the steel industry and close some steelmaking plants should be reviewed in the light of the changed situation. Liberals believe that concentration on bigger and fewer plants, on the scale adopted by the Japanese, of which we have no experience, may prove detrimental, particularly if uncertainties over fuel supplies continue. In addition, the economic and social dislocation within traditional steelmaking communities affected by such closures provides a very powerful argument for a complete rethink of strategy by both the Government and the European Coal and Steel Community.  SOCIAL RECONSTRUCTION  Underlying all our policies for social reconstruction are the twin themes of participation and individual freedom. Indeed the first is dependent on the second, for no person can play his full part in society unless he has the freedom to do so, and this must include freedom from discrimination, freedom from poverty and illness, the security of a roof over his head and the prospect of an equal start in life.  We are still a long way from achieving these goals even in 1974. Once again promises have been lightly made and cruelly broken because they have all been founded on assumptions of maximum production and economic growth. Only when we rid ourselves of the false logic that sees all social advancement as a product of economic efficiency will the well-being of society truly become a social service.  HEALTH AND SOCIAL WELFARE  The reorganisation of the National Health Service has failed to unify the Health Service or to ensure adequate public participation in the decisions which affect them. Liberals would bring local authority welfare services into the main structure of a unified NHS by placing them under the financial and administrative control of the area Health Authorities. We also favour democratic election to Area Health Boards so as to ensure a strong voice for the community.  The Chronically Sick and Disabled Persons Act 1970, having been a Private Members Bill, has, in many areas, failed to give people the comprehensive services that were intended as it gives local authorities additional responsibilities without providing extra funds to discharge them. We would introduce a Bill encompassing the provisions of the 1970 Act, so that central finance can be made available for its implementation, and extending provision for the disabled to other fields such as education where urgent national provision is required in facilities and finance.  The Liberal Party opposed the increase in prescription charges, the abolition of free school milk in junior schools and increased school meal charges - all callously petty economies introduced by a Conservative Government and all hitting directly at the poor and needy in our society.  SECURITY WITHOUT MEANS TESTS - A CREDIT INCOME TAX SCHEME  Liberals have long advocated a system of credit income tax whereby social security payments would automatically be paid to those in need. The Government's tax credit scheme, however, falls well short of the Liberal ideal because it values administrative efficiency above adequate provision for social need, while the Labour Party still pins its faith in the paternalism and stigma of the old means tested welfare system.  The Liberal scheme represents a major onslaught on the Means Test Society and would replace most of the 44 means tests to which under-privileged and handicapped people are subjected.  The Liberal credit income tax scheme would sweep away existing tax allowances, family allowances, national insurance benefits, nearly all supplementary benefits, housing subsidies, rent and rate rebates, family income supplements and a wide variety of miscellaneous benefits. All income would be taxed according to a progressive scale from the very first pound, but _everyone_ would be entitled to various 'credits' or allowances depending on circumstances. Where the liability to tax exceeded the value of credits there would be net tax to pay. Where the value of the credits exceeded the liability of tax the difference would be paid to the individual. automatically, through the tax system. Thus a redistribution of income could automatically be effected in favour of those needing help. There would be three types of credit - personal, housing and social. The most important would be the personal credit. This would be paid to every person and would be fixed at a level sufficient to guarantee a subsistence living to that individual. The credit for an adult would be greater than for a child. In the case of children under 16, the credit would be paid to the mother.  Then there would be a universal housing credit, paid regardless of whether the individual lived in rented or owner-occupied accommodation.  The third category of credits would correspond to national insurance benefits. There would be a credit for pensioners and for short- and long-term unemployment, sickness and disablement.  Whereas the Government scheme helps to tackle the poverty problem it has no intention of guaranteeing in every case that a family with no further help from the state would have enough to live on. The Liberal scheme does just this. It has estimated that a combined income and social security tax of 40 per cent (against the present 36 per cent) plus a recasting of VAT (but not on food) would be sufficient to operate the scheme. In the transitional period before the full introduction of our credit income tax scheme we propose that family allowances should be extended to the first child, and social security benefits proportionately increased with increases in average earnings. This is particularly urgent in the case of those such as widows whose circumstances can change so dramatically.  PROVISION FOR OUR PENSIONERS  Pensioners have had a bad deal from both Tory and Labour Governments. Amid extravagant claims that they have kept pace with increases in the cost of living, pensioners have actually been left behind in the great wage race. Under the Labour government pensions only rose marginally as a percentage of average earnings. The single pension represented 19 per cent of average earnings in 1964: and 21 per cent by the time Labour left office in 1970. Under the Conservatives the single pension has actually fallen back to 19 per cent of average earnings.  The Conservative Government's Occupational Pension Scheme incorporates a degree of compulsion which is anathema to Liberals in forcing everyone to contribute to a second pension scheme which will do nothing for today's pensioners. The last Labour Government had similar idealistic plans.  Liberals reaffirm the Beveridge commitment to introduce a basic pension which provides an adequate income irrespective of further financial provision. We would therefore increase the retirement pension in stages to 50 per cent of average earnings for a married couple and 33.5 per cent for a single person. Thus we would spread over a number of years a cost which if incurred immediately would amount to about &pound;1,400 million. However, there would be a considerable saving in supplementary benefits which at present are claimed by a third of our 8 million pensioners, at a cost of &pound;400 million.  This first phase of our pension plan would be a transitional stage, prior to the introduction of our full credit income tax scheme. Pensioners would be included in this scheme and would be entitled to a personal credit and housing credit as well as a pension credit resulting in an income of approximately two-thirds of average national earnings for a married couple. In addition we would reduce the retirement age for men to sixty. We would also abolish the earnings rule which penalises those who wish to go on doing a valuable job of work.  EDUCATION  Liberals have long recognised that resources for education are limited and across the board advance is impossible. We therefore took care to work out a ten-year development plan which would allocate clear priorities. In our view these should be:  1 The full implementation of the Plowden Committee's recommendations paying special attention to the need for pre-school education particularly in those areas of underprivilege and social deprivation, and the urgent reduction in the size of primary school classes to a maximum of 30 pupils. 2 The reorganisation of secondary school education on non-selective lines. There are more ways than one to organise a non-selective secondary school and we would allow local authorities maximum flexibility within minimum standards to adapt their system to local conditions. 3 A major reorganisation of curricula and school institutions to provide a more realistic last three years education for non-academic children. 4 The abolition of the binary system of further education and the closer integration of Universities, Polytechnics and Colleges of Education. In particular we would seek to establish Community Colleges open to all age groups, with the ultimate aim of providing further education to all who desire it. To this end an adequate student grant through our credit income tax scheme would be provided.  HOMES FOR ALL  The Liberal Party opposes the present Government's housing priorities because it considers them socially divisive.  They have severely cut local authority house building at a time when rising house prices have hit those trying to buy their own home; rents have been raised under the Housing Finance Act while, at the same time, wages have been frozen and then reduced by the three-day week; finally, the Government has failed to reform the mortgage system and failed to act effectively to curb land hoarding and speculation.  Liberal policy would fundamentally change our system of housing finance and property taxation, providing help to householders and tenants on an equal basis and concentrating a two-pronged attack on the housing shortage by building more houses and preserving as many houses as are inhabitable. In particular, we would end the divisiveness and inefficiency in the national housing programme by encouraging more flexible and enterprising policies which will allow for greater co-operation between local authorities, particularly in respect of the homeless, and an enhanced role for self-build organisations, possibly through the establishment of Government-approved consortia.  These are our proposals: 1 Freeze all rents during the period of economic restraint. 2 Repeal the Housing Finance Act and replace it with a genuinely fair rents system geared to true housing costs and pay a single housing allowance to tenants and householders on an equal basis automatically through the tax credit system. 3 Make all new urban office building contingent on the grant of a certificate of social need and concentrate the resources of the building industry on the housing programme. 4 Institute a crash programme of house-building in both public and private sectors with full use being made of industrialised building techniques. 5 Concentrate on housing renovation and repairs wherever possible, rather than on wholesale demolition. 6 Oblige Building Societies to stabilise interest rates by drawing on their reserves. Introduce new types of mortgage for first home buyers with low level initial repayments which rise with increased incomes and the cost of living. 7 Withdraw tax concessions and improvement grants for second home purchasers. 8 Give greater financial encouragement and responsibility to Tenants' Co operatives and Housing Associations. 9 Give local authorities power to acquire at cost price those properties which have stood unoccupied for three years.  PAYING FOR SECURITY - A RADICAL REDISTRIBUTION OF WEALTH  To finance all these proposals, there must be a radical redistribution of income and inherited wealth, the credit income tax proposals being the principal instrument for the former, and the Liberal proposal for a Gifts and Inheritance Tax, to replace Estate Duty and related in its incidence and rate to the gift or legacy and the wealth of the recipient, for the latter.  SITE VALUE RATING  We must also ensure that a proper contribution is made by those who own property and land.  As a means of reforming the present rating system which penalises those who improve their property while subsidising those who let it decay, Liberals have long advocated that rates should be levied on the value of the site only, and not on the value of the site and buildings as now. This would enable much of the present burden of rates to be shifted from householders.  The rating of site values would also be levied on land which, after proper inquiry, had been zoned for development but which had not been developed within a reasonable period. This would be an effective punitive measure against land hoarders and speculators.  Site value rating also recognises the undisputed fact that today a major source of wealth resides in development land and property rather than in income. Over a period of years there is no doubt that the rating of land values could gradually replace income tax as a main source of revenue. It would also recover for the community a proportion of the increased value of land created by mere assignment of planning consent.  THE STATUS OF WOMEN  Liberals will put particular emphasis on securing equality of opportunity and equal treatment for women. As a nation we can no longer afford to ignore the talent and energies of half our population as we have done so often in the past. We would legislate to ensure equal opportunities for women in all spheres of activity particularly in regard to employment, remuneration and social interaction. In particular we advocate the establishment of an independent Sex Discrimination Board, establishment of the principle of equal pay for work of equal value, tougher legislation to outlaw restrictive and discriminatory practices in industry and equal social security benefits for men and women, with adequate provision for maternity leave. Our aim is to provide the opportunity for women who so wish freely to seek satisfying goals other than a lifetime of childbearing.  CIVIL LIBERTIES - A BILL OF RIGHTS  Every person is entitled to protection from arbitrary interference in his personal and private affairs. Liberals are concerned that in our increasingly complex and bureaucratic society, fundamental freedoms should not be impaired or the individual citizen put at a disadvantage in his dealings with authority. Hence we have long advocated that minority and individual liberties should be guaranteed through a Bill of Rights effective in all parts of the United Kingdom and at all levels of Government and administration. Among protected guarantees should be the freedom of speech and assembly, the right to a fair trial, and protection against discrimination on the grounds of race, religion, sex or national or social origin. We would establish a small Claims Court where redress for minor injustices could be sought without recourse to the complexity and delay of the court circuit. Finally, we oppose any laws which penalise people retrospectively for actions done in the past, when through lapse of time they have become immune from prosecution or administrative action.  IMMIGRATION AND RACE RELATIONS  The Liberal Party regards freedom of movement as an important basic principle. However, since 1965 we have accepted that a densely-populated country such as ours cannot, at present, adequately cater for all those people who wish to come here. Accordingly we have supported a system of regulation whereby would-be immigrants are allowed to enter the United Kingdom only if they possess a work voucher showing that they have an actual job waiting for them or they possess particular skills which are needed in this country. While opposing illegal entry we strongly oppose the retrospective provisions of the 1971 Immigration Act and would take immediate action to remove these and other discriminatory clauses in that legislation.  We believe that we have a primary obligation to citizens of the United Kingdom and colonies, and also to Commonwealth citizens whose right to register as UK citizens after five years' residence in this country was removed by the 1971 Act and should be reinstated. We believe that a Royal Commission should urgently examine and clarify the rights of UK and Commonwealth citizens on the lines outlined above. In the meantime husbands and children from Uganda should be allowed to join refugees who have settled here. We are opposed to all forms of racial discrimination. The goal of integration is of critical importance and there should be a separate Minister for Community Relations and greater financial support for the Community Relations Commission.  THE FUTURE OF OUR COMMUNITY  THE ENVIRONMENT  Liberals recognise the need for an urgent re-appraisal of the use man is making of his material environment. We are concerned that in the present economic crisis panic measures should not be taken for the sake of short-sighted expediency, that might cause irreversible damage  The Liberal Party was the first to adopt a National Population Policy which includes free family planning advice as part of the NHS and a programme of education stressing the need for responsible parenthood in this era of scarce resources.  We insist on stringent controls on the use of all potential pollutants and in particular the establishment of a regionalised Pollution Inspectorate with investigatory and punitive powers over the use of noxious substances. In particular we are concerned that there should be the maximum recycling of all materials and that individuals and communities should have the legal means to resist, where necessary, threats to their environment from Government or commercial agencies.  The protection of our environment must be extended to the preservation of natural resources including our sources of energy, our landscape and our country side. We strongly support the principles of nature conservation and assert that the co-ordination of policies in other fields such as agriculture and transport must be pursued urgently.  Finally, the global environment, of which Britain is only a small part, can only be permanently preserved through international co-operation and support for United Nations environmental agencies.  TRANSPORT  Transport is inextricably bound up with overall development and must be integrated with national, regional and town and country planning. Our main priority must be to provide for integrated policies which acknowledge the changed roles of our various modes of transport. Conservative and Labour Governments have consistently worked on a piece-meal basis, Liberals assert that it is time to work out an overall strategy. In particular we advocate the prohibition of any further closures of railways and waterways until a study group has reported on the possibilities of further transferring freight carriage to rail and water. A new attitude must be taken to our railways which takes into account social and environmental factors as well as capital expenditure.  Transport has become a social service in many cases, particularly the regions and rural areas. We believe that County Councils should collaborate with the Ministry of Transport in promoting research studies into rural transport needs and preparing schemes for meeting them. Liberals hold the view that there must be a limitation of access for private vehicles to designated areas of city and town centres. Adequate parking facilities on the outskirts must be complemented by free, reliable public transport within these areas. Liberals would also establish Regional Transport Authorities to determine priorities of investment in all forms of transport, co-ordinate long-term planning of main roads, ports, airports, railways and inland waterways. Immediate attention must be given to assess the impact of increased oil prices upon our transport infrastructure.  AGRICULTURE AND THE COMMON MARKET  Liberals are well aware of the grave difficulties being experienced at the present time in many sections of the agricultural community. The Government, so far, has been deaf to the Liberal warnings and appeals concerning the plight of the dairy farming and livestock sections of agriculture. This could result in an actual food shortage in this country, particularly with regard to fresh foods arising from the excessive slaughter of breeding animals by farmers who, overwhelmed by the high cost of feedingstuffs and the very high interest rates, believe that their future is extremely insecure.  Help should be given to these sections of agriculture immediately, for the sake of both the farmer and the consumer. To build up to a sufficient level of profitability for the farmer and maintain a decent basic price for the consumer can be achieved in a variety of ways. One way which is capable of instant implementation is to compensate the consumer by raising pensions, and increasing family allowances which should also be extended to the oldest child. In our view it is necessary to create a farm structure which will encourage young men to enter agriculture as a career, with a possibility of achieving management and ownership. In the immediate term an improved wage structure for the industry must be established. The Agricultural Credit Corporation must also be swiftly expanded into a Land Bank. Loans would be available at a fixed rate of interest for projects which might properly be regarded as medium-term, in particular for the purchase of livestock and for projects now covered by Government grants, but should not be available for the purchase of farms or of land. In the present climate, it is essential that United Kingdom Marketing Boards should be retained and voluntary co-operatives encouraged. The Annual Price Review should certainly be retained but be coupled with a five-year strategic review.  In order to help keep down the price of land and make farms more readily available to genuine farmers, agricultural losses should no longer, in any circumstances, be allowable against profits from other businesses. Furthermore, Estate Duty relief should be restricted to bona fide agriculturalists. This would help prevent the major transference at the present time of city assets into agricultural land. Agricultural land in productive use would be zero-rated under our policy for Site Value Rating.  The Common Agricultural Policy of the European Economic Community must represent a just balance between the interests of consumers, efficient producers and international trading. The widening of the Community has already resulted in a less protectionist attitude but Britain must make an all-out effort to broaden and deepen this attitude. In the UK we do not have the problem, which has existed in the Community, of uneconomic farming units and we accept the need for measures to reduce their number. Finally, Liberals believe that there should be a rapid expansion of domestic production and an energetic drive by this country to secure allies in the Common Market for a major modification of the Common Agricultural Policy, so as to secure reasonably-priced food for the consumer and an acceptable return for the farmer.  POWER, PEOPLE AND THE COMMUNITY  The Liberal Party believes in devolution, decentralisation and electoral reform. We favour the immediate implementation of the Kilbrandon recommendation to establish elected Parliaments in Scotland and Wales and to this effect a Bill has already been introduced into the House of Commons by Liberal MP, Jo Grimond.  In the long term we would establish a federal system of Government for the United Kingdom with power in domestic matters transferred to Parliaments in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland and Provincial Assemblies in England. The Westminster Parliament would then become a Federal Parliament with a reformed second chamber in which the majority of members would be elected on a regional basis. If Britain is to have effective and successful centres of commerce and finance outside London there must be a real devolution of political and economic power to the regions. Recent Local Government reform has removed decision-making even further from the people. We advocate the setting up of Neighbourhood Councils below the District Councils to act as efficient transmitters of protest and suggestion from the community.  Liberals would introduce proportional representation by the single transferable vote for all elections. The present electoral system buttresses the discredited 'two- party system' of confrontation. Electoral Reform, while giving fairer representation to different sections, will make co-operation between them easier. The success of proportional representation in Northern Ireland in uniting a divided community through a power-sharing executive is strong testimony for its introduction in Britain as a whole to heal the rifts in our society.  Parliament has lost touch with the country. It must be brought back to the people and its proceedings opened up to the broadcasting media. Its formality must not deter improvements in the organisation of business to make Parliament more efficient and effective, with really full-time members elected for fixed five-year periods.  Liberals urge the establishment of direct elections to a European Parliament which would give full democratic power of control over Community activities.  Maximum opportunity must be offered at all levels for involving citizens in the process of Government, through the fullest possible provision of information.  EUROPE AND THE WORLD  We must not allow our present national crisis to let us forget the immense problems of instability in the world, that have loomed and threatened in the last few months. The need for international co-operation and understanding has never been more pressing and the contribution of Britain to building a better world as well as our hopes of a better life in these islands depend on partnership with our democratic neighbours.  THE EUROPEAN ECONOMIC COMMUNITY  Liberals have always insisted on the duty of Britain to play a leading role in transforming Western Europe from warring rivalry into a united community, hence our consistent support for British membership of the Common Market. Further more, it is only as a full participant in the world's largest trading entity that we can hope to solve our chronic balance of payments problem and at the same time develop the political unity that will guarantee peace and free us from the spectre of domination by the super powers.  We deplore the delay in joining the Common Market for which Conservative and Labour Governments were equally to blame, but we are even more critical of the narrow-minded nationalism of many so-called 'internationalists' in the Labour Party who still shun their responsibility to represent their constituents in the European Parliament. We also condemn the Conservative Government for abdicating their great opportunity to develop the Community in a democratic and outward-looking manner in favour of meek compliance with the interests of the French Government. The present Common Market structure is not what we voted for and the Liberal representatives in the European Parliament have lost no opportunity to point the way in which we feel the Community should develop. Liberals are thus effective but constructive critics of the policies of the Common Market. We want to reform its institutions to see real power exercised by an elected European Parliament. We want to see the progressive reduction of the protectionist aspects of the Common Agriculture Policy, an imaginative and effective regional policy and the harmonisation, not bureaucratisation, of economic and social policies, for the benefit of all members. Finally, we want to see the adoption of an outward-looking trade policy towards the rest of the world and particularly the developing countries. We believe that the great purposes of the Community can be achieved with far-sightedness and vision.  FOREIGN AFFAIRS AND DEFENCE  Looking beyond the EEC we are in favour of the maintenance of NATO until such time as a new European security system based on mutual withdrawal and the mutual reduction of forces in the East and West has been successfully negotiated. Within this limit we support efforts at détente and in particular the Ostpolitik of the West German Government. We are opposed to the admission to the European Community of any country which has not a democratic form of government, and are unhappy about the association with NATO of countries like Portugal and Greece which are not democratic. The purpose of NATO should be to defend democracy.  But the maintenance of our traditional alliances is also of critical importance if we are to return stability to world commodity and money markets and absorb the massive disruption that has and will continue to be caused by the quadrupling of oil prices. Positive international agreements are vital to bring a new radical world monetary framework that could save the world from damaging economic recession and exacerbated racial tension. Finally, it is essential that through a new monetary framework Britain and the developed world recognise the plight of the third world and begin to grant realistic exchanges for raw materials and commodities that will raise the Third World from starvation and deprivation.  CONCLUSION  This is the Liberal Party's programme for national reconstruction. It is fundamental because we believe that the crisis which faces us as a nation is deep-seated and requires a fundamental response. It is ambitious because the multiple crisis that faces us offers the opportunity to put the past behind us and embark on a new era of reconstruction. Above all it is idealistic because we must raise our sights beyond selfish personal concerns, we must stop internal feuds which weaken and divide us and look to a future without class conflicts, partisan bitterness and excessive self-criticism."
"Conservatives",197402,"'Firm action for a fair Britain'  Today we face great dangers both from within our own country and from outside. The problems are formidable, but there is no reason why they should overwhelm us.  The assets of the British people are great. Not simply our technical skills and our natural resources, but also, more important than these, the strength and stability of our institutions and the determination of our people in moments of crisis to ensure that good sense and moderation prevail.  If we are to make the best use of those assets it is essential that the affairs of this country are in the hands of a strong government, able to take firm measures in defence of the national interest.  This means a Conservative Government with a renewed mandate from the people and with a full five years in which to guide the nation safely through the difficult period that lies ahead.  That is why we need a General Election now.  Once the General Election is behind us then we must put aside our differences and join in a common determination to establish and maintain a secure, civilised fair society.  THE DANGER FROM OUTSIDE  The world has changed dramatically since we last sought the support of the electorate.  In the last two years there has been a dramatic rise in the world price of almost all the essential raw materials and foods which we have to import from overseas.  Many of these prices have doubled in the past year alone, making it impossible to stem the rise in the cost of living.  Now on top of these increases comes the huge increase in oil prices, which in turn will affect the cost of almost everything that we produce or buy in this country.  Fortunately, as far as energy is concerned, Britain will in the long run be able to cope better than most. We have plentiful supplies of coal and natural gas. We are well advanced in the development of nuclear power. Above all, within five years from now we should be able to satisfy the greater part of our needs with our own oil from the seas around our shores, provided we make the determined effort that will be necessary.  But let no one suppose that as a nation we can deal with the immediate problem without hardship and sacrifice.  It will impose a greatly increased burden on our balance of payments, and for the time being will make us poorer as a nation than we would otherwise have been.  What we must continue to ensure is that any sacrifices are shared equitably and that hardship does not fall on those least able to bear it.  If the situation requires further action - whether it be in the field of public expenditure or of tax or monetary policies - we shall not hesitate to take it.  But the basis of our firm action will be fairness.  THE DANGER FROM WITHIN  Events from overseas have held us back. They will not destroy us.  What could destroy, not just our present standard of living but all our hopes for the future, would be inflation we brought upon ourselves.  Despite the unprecedented sharp rise in world prices, price increases in the shops have, as a result of our counter-inflation policies, been much less than would otherwise have been the case.  We have also made sure that those worst hit by rising prices, in particular pensioners, are better protected than they have ever been before.  But we have also had to deal with the inflation which comes as a result of excessive wage increases here at home.  For more than two years we tried strenuously to deal with this problem by voluntary means. In particular we asked trade unions and employers to join us in working out a voluntary scheme to prevent one group of workers using its industrial strength to steal a march over those working in other industries.  Then other groups are inevitably provoked into leapfrogging. And so it goes on, with the old, the weak and those who do not or will not strike, suffering more at each turn of the inflationary screw.  In the end, after all our talks, although we agreed on objectives, the trade unions could not agree with us on a voluntary means of achieving them, and we had to ask Parliament for statutory powers over pay and prices to hold the line against inflation.  Stages 1 and 2 of that policy, which are now completed, proved more successful than our critics thought possible. The rise in prices due to internal causes was sharply reduced - to a greater extent, indeed, than in most other countries.  Now, in Stage 3 nearly six million workers have concluded wage agreements within the approved limits. The special position of the mineworkers has been recognised by an offer, within Stage 3, of a size which few other groups of workers can hope to achieve.  It is a tragedy that the miners' leaders should have turned down this offer.  The action taken by the National Union of Mineworkers has already caused great damage and threatens even greater damage for the future.  It must be the aim of any responsible Government to reach a settlement of this dispute at the earliest possible moment.  The choice before the Government, and now the choice before the country, is clear.  On the one hand it would be possible to accept the NUM's terms for a settlement.  The country must realise what the consequences of this would be.  It would mean accepting the abuse of industrial power to gain a privileged position.  It would undermine the position of moderate trade union leaders.  It would make it certain that similar strikes occurred at frequent intervals in the future.  It would destroy our chances of containing inflation.  The alternative is to reach a settlement with the NUM on terms which safe guard the nation's interests as well as the miners.  The basis of that settlement must be fairness.  The terms must be fair to the miners, but they must also be fair to the nearly six million workers who have now accepted settlements within the limits of our counter-inflation policy and the many others who are prepared to do so.  They must be fair to the even greater number of people who have no union to stand up for them and who rely on the elected government to look after their interests.  A Conservative Government with a new mandate and five years of certain authority ahead of it would be in a good position to reach such a settlement.  The present offer by the National Coal Board remains on the table. It can be accepted at any time.  We have accepted the principles of the Pay Board's report on relative rates of pay between one group of workers and another. We have already set up machinery for the examination of major claims about relative pay levels, based on the Pay Board.  As its first task, this new machinery will conduct a full examination of the miners' case within this framework. It will take due account of the relative claims of other groups, many of whom - such as nurses and teachers - gave evidence during the preparation of the Relativities Report. Moreover, we are prepared to undertake that whatever recommendation the new body makes on the miners' case can be backdated to the first of March.  It will be completely free to take evidence from any quarter and to decide upon its recommendations.  So it will be impartial and it will be thorough.  And it will be fair, not only to the miners, but to everyone else.  But whatever settlement is reached, the fact must be faced that, for a time, our nation's resources will be stretched to the limit, and those most in need of protection against inflation must have first claim on them.  This Conservative Government has already moved from a two-yearly to an annual review of pensions and all other benefits. We will now move to a six monthly up-rating of pensions and other long-term benefits.  This will have to be paid for by the community as a whole, out of higher contributions which must be shared fairly amongst all the people.  A fair and orderly policy for pay and prices, for pensions and benefits meets the economic needs of the country.  But at the same time, it must be matched by a fair and orderly way of dealing with our industrial relations.  The foundations for better relations in industry were laid in the Industrial Relations Act. We have never pretended that it would be easy to implement.  But other industrial countries have found that good industrial relations require a proper framework of law and we are sure that Britain is no exception.  We shall therefore maintain the essential structure of the Industrial Relations Act, but we shall amend it in the light of experience, and after consultation with both sides of industry, in order  -   to meet any valid criticisms  -   to make conciliation a pre-condition of court action  -   and to provide more effective control for the majority of union       members by ensuring that they have the opportunity to elect the       governing bodies and national leaders of their unions by a postal       ballot.  We shall also seek to improve industrial relations by bringing in new legislation, following discussions with both sides of industry, designed to make large and medium-sized firms introduce a wider measure of employee-participation.  The best way of curbing the majority of extremists in the trade unions is for the moderate majority of union members to stand up and be counted.  But the fact remains that a small number of militant extremists can so manipulate and abuse the monopoly power of their unions as to cause incalculable damage to the country and to the fabric of our society itself.  Moreover, it is manifestly unfair that those who do not go on strike are, in effect, obliged to subsidise those who do.  It is no part of our policy to see the wives and children of men on strike suffering.  But it is only right that the unions themselves, and not the taxpayer, should accept their primary responsibility for the welfare of the families of men who choose to go on strike; and, after discussions with trade unions and employers. we will amend the social security system accordingly.  The General Election that is now upon us is a chance for the British people to show the world that at a time of crisis the overwhelming majority of us are determined not to tear ourselves apart, but to close ranks.  It is a chance, in other words, to demonstrate that we believe in ourselves as a nation.  This is our aim:  -   a Britain united in moderation, not divided by extremism a society       in which there is change without revolution  -   a Government that is strong in order to protect the weak  -   a people who enjoy freedom with responsibility  -   a morality of fairness without regimentation  -   a nation with faith in itself, and a people with self-respect.  We are a great nation, with a long and eventful history behind us.  We have survived grave perils in the past, and we can do so again now. But to do so, two things are needed, as they have always been: a united people, prepared to put aside our differences to fight the common threat; and a strong Government, able to do whatever is necessary to carry out the people's will.  In the pages that follow we set out our record over the four years since we were voted into office, our proposals for the future, and the nature of the choice now facing the nation.  Although we have not been able to do as much as we would have liked, and the problems which face us are immense, the record of the progress we have made so far, despite all the difficulties, both national and international, that have beset us, is important in two ways.  First, looking back, it provides a fair basis for a comparison with the record of our predecessors. Second, looking ahead, the achievements of the past four years provide the solid foundation for our further progress once the present difficulties are overcome.  Until the present crisis hit the country, the living standards of the British people, since we took office in 1970, had been rising more than twice as fast as they did during the period of the former Labour administration. One of the cruellest consequences of inflation is the unfair way in which it hits some groups in the community far harder than others. But despite the hardship caused by rising prices, for the great majority of the people of this country, the pronounced rise in living standards was a reality; and with the expansion of the nation's economy came a welcome restoration of Britain's strength in the world.  This prosperity has now, for the time being, been blighted by the effects of the three-day week, forced upon us by the need to ration electricity so as to prevent our power stations from running out of coal altogether as a consequence of the industrial action taken by the National Union of Mineworkers.  And even when the need for the three-day week is over, we must still, for some time to come, and in common with many other countries, expect a pause in the rise in our living standards; since, for the time being, all the extra national wealth created will be needed to pay for the higher cost of essential imports, notably oil, and will not, therefore, be available for increased prosperity at home.  This obviously has particular implications for those of our programmes and objectives which necessarily involve substantial Government expenditure, where everything is dependent on the economic resources available. Here the crisis makes it more essential than ever to avoid easy but irresponsible promises beyond what the country can at present afford. We have, therefore, undertaken a full and realistic review of all our policies in the light of the changed conditions faced by the Western world as a whole. As a result, in framing our specific proposals, we have concentrated on indicating what our priorities in the next Parliament will be; on outlining, in each field, those programmes that will be given first claim in present economic circumstances.  But while this means that the next year or two will inevitably be arduous and difficult, further ahead, provided we work together as one nation and stand firm against inflation, we can look forward to an economy more soundly based than we have known since the war, thanks to the increasing availability of North Sea oil. In addition to going a long way towards solving the energy crisis, this promises radically to transform our balance of payment position.  Meanwhile, during the difficult period that lies ahead, we shall continue to take special care to protect the pensioners, the lower paid, and those in need.  It may be that we are able to do more than is promised in this manifesto. That will depend, in part, on world economic forces beyond our control; but, more than anything else, it will depend on our ability to work together as one nation and on the extent of our success in winning the vitally important battle against inflation. Meanwhile, at this critical time in our nation's affairs, we believe it to be right to err on the side of caution; to promise too little rather than too much.  Beyond this, however, there is something that no crisis can change or slow down. That is our vision of the Britain in which we believe, the ideal which will inform all that we do.  A Britain united in moderation, not divided by extremism. A society in which there is change without revolution. A Government that is strong in order to protect the weak. A people who enjoy freedom with responsibility. A morality of fairness without regimentation. A nation with faith in itself, and a people with self-respect.  HOLDING THE LINE AGAINST INFLATION  Our consistent aim since taking office has been, and remains, to safeguard and enhance the well-being of the British people.  Throughout that period, and never more so than today, the gravest threat to our national well-being has been the menace of unrestrained inflation.  This was a legacy we inherited from our predecessors. In our 1970 Election Manifesto, we pledged that 'we will give overriding priority to bringing the present inflation under control', but warned that 'the Labour Government's policies have unleashed forces which no Government could hope to reverse over night'.  We reduced Labour's rates of indirect taxation, which bore directly on prices. We made unprecedented efforts to obtain the co-operation of trade unions and employers in formulating an effective voluntary pay and prices policy. When agreement on this proved impossible, we sought and obtained the consent of Parliament to control pay, prices and profits by law.  But our warning that the battle against inflation would not be quickly or easily won has proved even truer than we feared at the time. For on top of all the problems we inherited, we have had to absorb an unprecedented rise in the world prices of almost all the essential foods and raw materials that we are obliged to import from overseas. It is this, and not membership of the Common Market, which has led to the substantial rise in the price of food in the shops.  When we took office nearly four years ago, prices were not merely rising alarmingly: the rate of increase was steadily accelerating. As a result of our policies so far, we have been able to reduce the rise in prices due to internal causes and, therefore, within our own control as a nation.  But the rate at which prices are rising is still dangerously high, and on top of everything else we now have to absorb a four-fold increase in the price of oil. This makes it all the more vital that we hold the line against inflation caused by excessive wage settlements at home.  We shall, therefore, press ahead with the pay and prices policy, if necessary stiffening it in the light of the developing economic situation.  We shall ensure that the Price Commission has the powers it needs to protect the consumer from unnecessary price rises, and we will examine further means of controlling the rise in prices of key items of food in the household budget.  We shall renew our offer to the TUC and CBI to join us in working out an effective voluntary pay and prices policy, ultimately to replace the existing statutory policy, in the management and evolution of which both sides of industry would jointly participate.  Meanwhile, however, it is manifestly unfair that those who do not go on strike are, in effect, obliged to subsidise those who do. It is no part of our policy to see the wives and children of men on strike suffering. But it is only right that the unions themselves, and not the taxpayer, should accept their primary responsibility for the welfare of the families of men who choose to go on strike; and after discussions with trade unions and employers, we will amend the social security system accordingly.  BEATING THE ENERGY CRISIS  Well before the current oil crisis emerged in the aftermath of the Arab-Israeli War of October 1973, we were developing, as a matter of urgency, a new and comprehensive energy policy.  Our objective was, first, to reduce our hitherto growing dependence on imported oil and, second, among home-produced sources of fuel and power, to plan for the proper balance between coal, North Sea oil, natural gas and nuclear power.  To this end we had already: (A) Passed the Coal Industry Act, to provide massive funds for the industry's modernisation and substantial extra money for miners' pensions and other benefits; thus, for the first time in twenty years, providing the coal mining industry and those who work in it with a secure future; (B) Accelerated the exploitation of the vast proven oil reserves in the British sector of the North Sea and set up the Scottish Petroleum Office under a Scottish Minister to co-ordinate all on-shore developments; (C) Initiated negotiations to purchase the entire natural gas output of the Frigg field in the Norwegian sector of the North Sea; (D) Merged Britain's nuclear power station capacity into a single new company, the National Nuclear Corporation, and agreed with the NNC and the Central Electricity Generating Board to build a new generation of atomic power stations.  In the light of the post-October 1973 energy crisis, and in particular the rocketing price of imported oil, still further steps were needed. Accordingly, we set up a Department of Energy under a Secretary of State, whose long term goal is to achieve national self-sufficiency in energy.  The first oil from the British sector of the North Sea is due to be landed this year and by 1980 the North Sea should be supplying the greater part of our national needs. In full co-operation with private enterprise, we will press ahead with the extraction and landing of North Sea oil, and prospecting for Celtic Sea oil, as fast as is technically and humanly possible. Labour's irrelevant and disastrous proposal to nationalise our offshore oil would needlessly deprive Britain of an invaluable source of capital, skills and experience, and would cause confusion and delay when the nation can least afford it.  Britain has pioneered nuclear power technology. Already we generate a higher proportion of our electricity in nuclear stations than any other European country, and we shall shortly be announcing the details of our new nuclear power station programme.  We are working out with the National Coal Board an expanded investment programme for coal. We shall press ahead with the rapid development of the newly discovered coalfield in Selby, Yorkshire - the largest and richest unworked seam in Europe.  The new Department of Energy is urgently examining every possibility for increasing our own national energy resources - including the use of methane gas, solar power and tidal power. However successful we are in developing the main sources of energy, the greater the range of available sources the less vulnerable we shall be.  The new Department is also working out the details of a major energy conservation programme, and will announce steps to ensure the maximum efficiency in the use of expensive fuel. We will give a strong lead on improving standards of building design so as to make the best use of fuel. We will encourage higher insulation standards in homes, offices and factories.  As a result of the measures already taken and those now proposed, we shall be better placed in terms of energy supplies than most other nations. However, while we should thus enjoy secure supplies of the fuels the nation needs, we cannot escape from the higher cost of those fuels. The days of cheap energy are gone for good.  Taken as a whole, our measures throughout the field of energy will set a secure pattern for the future. But the nation's position must also be safeguarded in the short term. We have already concluded an important agreement with Iran to procure a substantial quantity of oil in exchange for British exports.  We shall continue to work both within the framework of the European Economic Community and in the wider context of consumer/producer collaboration to ensure an adequate flow of oil from the major producing countries, so long as our dependence on overseas sources of supply remains.  INDUSTRY, AGRICULTURE, AND THE REGIONS  In present circumstances, energy policy must necessarily take pride of place in the Government's programme to provide the essential long-term framework for soundly based industrial and agricultural expansion.  But other aspects, to which we have rightly given priority in the past, will not be forgotten or neglected.  During the past four years we have introduced a wide range of new measures to bring new life to some of the older and decaying industrial regions of Britain, both for the benefit of the people of those regions and of the economic health of the nation as a whole.  Through the Industry Act, through free depreciation, and in other ways, we have provided more effective financial incentives for industrial expansion in these areas than they have ever previously enjoyed; and we have set up the Industrial Development Executive to ensure that these incentives give the greatest value for money.  We have greatly increased the programmes for improving housing and the social services in these regions, and for clearing away the scars of dereliction; and we have given them special priority in the provision of industrial training. We have also greatly improved their transport links.  An important source of new help for the regions over the years ahead should derive from our membership of the European Community. We attach importance to a substantial fund devoted to Community Regional Development, and a decision is to be taken early this year.  For the nation as a whole, we have introduced the Training Opportunities Scheme, to meet the needs of an economy in which rapid technological change and new patterns of demand shut down old jobs and open up new ones. We have nearly trebled the numbers being trained and retrained under Government auspices in Government Training Centres. Our Employment and Training Act has provided industry with help in increasing its own training, related to actual labour needs, through the newly established Manpower Services Commission.  We shall continue to expand the Training Opportunities Scheme, and continue to modernise the employment services.  We have announced new legislation to bring up to date the law dealing with the health and safety of people at work.  We have announced a massive ten-year expansion and modernisation programme for the steel industry.  After nearly four years of Conservative Government the British aircraft industry has the biggest order book in this century. In technology, in research and in production we have established skills and abilities which provide us with immense opportunities within Europe and throughout the world to see that this industry plays an important role in the future commercial success of Britain.  We are the first Government to have given special attention to small firms, appointing a Minister with special responsibility for them. We have implemented the majority of the Bolton Report recommendations, especially in the field of taxation. We do not believe that, in business, bigger is necessarily better.  AGRICULTURE  We reaffirm our traditional Conservative support for British agriculture, which over the past four years, has enjoyed a marked resurgence of confidence.  The past year has seen some sections of our agriculture doing well, while others, such as the dairy industry, have been affected by the sharp rise in the price of feedingstuffs. The particular problem of milk producers is being dealt with in the Price Review to be announced very shortly.  The long-term prospects for the expansion of British agriculture have never been better. Membership of the European Economic Community, for the great majority of British farmers, is, and will continue to be, of enormous benefit, ensuring an enlarged market for farm produce, increased returns to efficient farmers and better protection from market fluctuations. Our current balance of payments problems make a healthy home agriculture more important than ever. Considerable opportunities for expansion exist, and our policies will continue to recognise this.  INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS  But the Achilles heel of the British economy has long been, and continues to be, industrial relations.  It is largely because of this that our economic progress since the war has consistently lagged behind that of most other industrial nations - and will continue to do so in the future, with grave consequences, unless a major improvement in industrial relations can be secured.  It is in large part because of this that we find ourselves in the present crisis, the gravest since the war.  By setting the pound free in the present unsettled situation, we have liberated the economy and the nation from the restrictions of being pegged to an unrealistic exchange rate. By drastically cutting taxation, we have liberated the economy and the nation from the stultifying imposts of Socialism.  But we have not yet been able to liberate the economy and the nation from the disruption, the inflation, and the inefficiency caused by bad industrial relations.  The need for action on this front was recognised by our predecessors, who first set up a Royal Commission to inquire into the subject and then prepared a major Bill to reform trade union law - only to withdraw it in an abject and humiliating surrender to trade union pressure. This disastrous incident has played a large part in creating the present situation.  In accordance both with our pre-election pledges and with the clear will of the majority of the British people, one of our first steps on taking office was to act where Labour had capitulated.  The Industrial Relations Act represents the first thorough-going reform of trade union law in modern times. Its purpose is to provide for an up-to-date and realistic legal framework for industrial relations, to strengthen responsible trade union leadership, to guarantee fundamental trade union rights, to provide remedies hitherto unavailable for the peaceful solution of disputes about negotiating rights, and to safeguard the individual from the abuse of power, whether by management or unions. Although it is a matter for national regret that its usefulness has been limited by the refusal, so far, of most trade unions to co operate in its working, it is nevertheless already having some significant effects. More than 15,000 people have made use of remedies it provides to protect individual rights and the National Industrial Relations Court - although sup posed to be banned by the unions - has dealt with almost 1,000 cases.  Other industrial countries have found that good industrial relations require a proper framework of law and we are sure that Britain is no exception.  We shall therefore maintain the essential structure of the Industrial Relations Act, but we shall amend it in the light of experience, and after consultation with both sides of industry, in order (a) to meet any valid criticisms; (b) to make conciliation a pre-condition of court action; and (c) to provide more effective control for the majority of union members by ensuring that they have the opportunity to elect the governing bodies and national leaders of their unions by a postal ballot.  We shall also seek to improve industrial relations by bringing in new legislation, following discussions with both sides of industry, designed to make large and medium-sized firms introduce a wider measure of employee-participation. We have set up a steering group drawn from the Government, the CBI and the TUC to study methods to improve job satisfaction.  TAXATION  In our 1970 Election Manifesto we promised both to reduce and reform taxation. Both these pledges have been carried out to the letter.  Whereas our predecessors, during their term of office, increased tax rates by &pound;3,000 million a year, we have cut tax rates by an even greater amount.  Food has been relieved of tax altogether. The biggest cuts in income tax have been made by increases in the personal allowances, which give the largest relief, proportionately, to the less well-off taxpayer. Many people with small incomes have been relieved of income tax altogether. We have also reduced the rate of tax on the first slice of income from savings, which has helped those - usually elderly - living on small fixed incomes, who have been particularly hard hit by rising prices.  In the field of tax reform, we have unified income tax and surtax in a single graduated system of personal tax, in a form that can be simply under stood. We have reformed company taxation, so as to end Labour's discrimination against the ordinary shareholder. And we have replaced both Purchase Tax and SET by a 10 per cent Value Added Tax - the lowest standard VAT rate in Europe. No new tax is ever popular, and VAT is no exception. But it is fairer and less onerous than the taxes it replaced.  Our record on tax reduction and tax reform speaks for itself. Obviously in the present grave situation it would be irresponsible to make any commitments about tax rates. But what we can promise is that the burden of taxation on everyone in Britain will be far less than it would be under Labour, which is committed to a hugely expensive programme of state take-over, a massive expansion of public expenditure far beyond what the nation can afford, and to a belief in high taxation as an end in itself.  We shall continue our programme of tax reform with the Tax Credit Scheme. We will introduce legislation in the next Parliament in order to implement the scheme as soon as the economic situation allows.  The separation between the systems of taxation and social security has proved, in recent years, an increasingly difficult obstacle to the creation of a fair society. In particular, it has made it difficult to give sufficient help to those who, while not in acute poverty, are nonetheless struggling and hard pressed.  The Tax Credit Scheme will bring the two systems - of taxation and social security - together in a single coherent scheme, which will greatly alleviate this problem and bring immediate help to those now affected by it.  The introduction of the scheme will further simplify and modernise our tax system, and bring substantial savings in the cost of administration. For social security, it will represent the most important advance since the implementation of the Beveridge Report more than a generation ago.  The first step would be to pay tax credits for children, including the first child, for whom mothers at present receive no family allowance at all. These child credits, which will be paid to the mother, will be worth more than the existing income tax child allowances and family allowances which they will replace. Mothers will get cash each week through the Post Office, in exactly the same way as they cash the existing, but less valuable, family allowances.  When fully implemented the tax credit scheme:  -   will provide a positive social benefit in cash to millions of       hard-pressed families with low incomes, especially where there are       children;  -   will give credits as a right - automatically and without a       means-test;  -   will relieve hundreds of thousands of pensioners from the need to       claim supplementary benefit and give a significant increase in       income to another 3 or 4 million pensioners.  HELPING THE PENSIONER  In the four years since we took office, we have:  (A) Increased pensions every year. Labour only increased pensions every other year.  (B) Paid, in each of the last two years, a Christmas bonus as well. Labour never did.  (C) Seen to it that, each year, the increase in the pension was greater than the increase in the cost of living; so that each time there has been a real increase in pensioners' living standards. During the last five years of Labour, the real purchasing power of the pension actually fell.  (D) Paid a pension to those over-80s to whom Labour denied one altogether.  In addition, we have raised the amount that pensioners may earn without having their pension reduced. We have improved the allowance which helps many of those on supplementary pensions with the cost of heating their homes.  We have lowered the age at which increases in public service and armed forces pensions become payable, and we have further improved the position of  war pensioners and their widows. Public service pensions, armed forces pensions and supplementary pensions are all now reviewed every single year, together with the main national insurance benefits.  We have undertaken to give compensation to those public service pensioners who have been adversely affected by the provisions of the statutory pay and prices policy, and to allow similar steps to be taken by private occupational schemes.  We are acutely conscious of the hardship suffered by many pensioners as a result of inflation. That is why, for pensioners in particular, the most important section of our programme for the next Parliament is our pledge to hold the line against inflation.  Nevertheless, so far as the actual pension is concerned, we shall continue in the next Parliament the progress we have made so far.  We shall continue to give the pensioner first priority in the entire field of social service expenditure.  We have already moved from a two-yearly to an annual review of pensions and all other benefits. We will now move to a six monthly up-rating of pensions and other long-term benefits. We shall, of course, continue to ensure that pensions are increased by at least as much as the cost of living.  We shall continue to relax the earnings rule during the next Parliament. Our ultimate objective is to abolish it altogether.  What we shall not do is compete with the Labour Party in an auction of promises which we do not believe can be kept. We are confident that a dispassionate comparison of our record with that of our predecessors speaks for itself.  Finally, in addition to doing our best to fulfil the community's responsibility to those already retired or approaching retirement, we shall press ahead with our new pensions scheme, which will, in the long term, completely transform the financial prospects of those no longer at work. From next year, every one in employment will be building up the right to a second pension, related to their earnings, on top of the basic State pension. For most people this will be provided through schemes run by the companies where they work; but there will be a reserve State scheme for those who cannot otherwise be properly covered.  The scheme for a second pension will include proper protection of pension rights on change of job, better provision for widows, and some safeguard against rising prices. It will ensure that, for future generations of the retired, there will no longer be such a big drop in income which is so often the biggest single problem for those ceasing to work today.  This new scheme will greatly improve the pension prospects for women in employment, for many of them will be able to earn a second pension for the first time and many, too, will get a second widow's pension also for the first time. Married women in employment will retain their right not to pay the full contribution to the basic State scheme.  MEETING SPECIAL NEED  A consistent feature of our social security policy since we first took office has been the bringing of new help to particular groups in society, hitherto insufficiently recognised by Governments, who have need of special help, whether in cash or in care.  Thus we have:  (A) Introduced, for the first time, a range of additional 'invalidity' benefits for wage-earners who cannot work because of long-term illness or incapacity;  (B) Introduced, for the first time, special tax-free attendance allowances for seriously disabled people who need a great deal of care and attention;  (C) Introduced, for the first time, a Family Income Supplement for low wage earning families with children;  (D) Introduced, for the first time, a widow's pension for women, without young children, who were widowed between the ages of 40 and 50.  We are, however, conscious of how very much remains to be done in meeting cases of special need, particularly so far as the disabled are concerned. We shall be carrying out by this autumn our statutory duty to report to Parliament on our proposals for improving the cash provision for the disabled, including the possibility of a disablement income.  We recognise the serious problem of acute family deprivation which exists in certain parts of the country - the inner city areas, some of our older industrial areas and, indeed, some of the new housing estates where there live families rehoused from the central parts of the cities. These areas often contain many of the various forms of deprivation - bad housing, the most out-dated school buildings, the oldest hospitals, lack of community facilities and a bad environment generally - coupled with an inability to cope amongst the families concerned, sometimes, but not always, caused by poverty.  We shall therefore start a new drive to bring more resources into these areas, both to improve living conditions and the environment generally, and to provide a wide range of advice and help to the families concerned. We will concentrate this help on the worst areas; and give more opportunity for local people to play a part in the affairs of their community.  In these and other deprived inner city areas we shall place special emphasis on housing needs and the setting up of comprehensive advice centres, in partnership with the significant contribution already being made by independent voluntary agencies.  In London, these problems are becoming intensified by a shortage of men and women to operate most public services and to teach in the schools. We have therefore referred the whole question of the London Allowance payable to teachers and other public servants to the Pay Board, and will act on the Board's report as soon as we receive it.  We shall provide family planning within the National Health Service.  We shall continue to improve the services for the old, the disabled, the mentally ill and the mentally handicapped at home, in the community and in hospital. We shall publish a White Paper on services for the mentally ill. We have increased greatly the numbers of home helps, district nurses and health visitors. We shall improve the services for children and legislate on adoption. We have set in hand help for the deaf and the arthritic and rheumatic. We shall act as necessary on the Finer Report on one-parent families when it is received.  We have much expanded the National Health Service. We have reformed its administration to improve services to the patient. We shall implement the principal recommendations of the Briggs Report on nursing, while preserving the identity of the health visitor. We will take any steps considered necessary to improve hospital complaint procedures in the light of the Davies Report.  Our hospital, health centre and social service building programmes are all much larger in real terms than those of our Labour predecessors. We plan to supplement the District General Hospital network by a network of community hospitals, basing them where practicable on some of the existing smaller local hospitals. We aim to continue reducing the waiting time for non-urgent surgery.  We reject Labour's proposal to abolish private practice and private provision in association with the National Health Service. This is unacceptable in principle and in practice would only reduce the skills available to patients as a whole.  Throughout the entire field of meeting special need, we are particularly conscious of the valuable work done by voluntary organisations, and we shall continue to help them without compromising their independence. To this end, we will review the legal framework within which charities operate.  HOUSING  The high level of interest rates in an inflationary world has inevitably put difficulties in the way of the expansion of home ownership to which we remain firmly committed. Nonetheless, since 1970, about a million families have become home-owners for the first time, bringing the total to more than half the families in Britain.  Over the first three full years since we took office, we have provided two million new or improved homes. This is 500,000 more than Labour provided in the previous three years, for which they were responsible.  The number of new home-owners would have been still larger had certain Councils not opposed the sale of Council houses to those Council tenants who were willing and able to buy them with the help offered by the Government.  Subject to a right of appeal by the local authority to the Secretary of State on clearly specified grounds, we shall ensure that, in future, established Council tenants are able, as of right, to buy on reasonable terms the house or flat in which they live.  We have made an agreement with the building societies which will ensure in the long term greater stability in the flow of funds for house purchase, and the building societies have agreed to introduce as soon as possible a scheme to enable first-time purchasers to pay less in the early years of their mortgage. We shall also seek other new ways to help young married couples to become home-owners earlier, including new ways of channelling the funds of leading financial institutions into the finance of house purchase.  We will provide new powers and more funds for the Housing Corporation and the voluntary housing movement. This will provide dwellings for both letting and co-ownership, and include new arrangements for people with special housing problems.  We shall provide more houses for renting in areas of housing need.  We will ensure that both the local authorities and nationalised industries release housing land for mixed schemes of public and private development.  We will continue with our slum clearance programme designed to clear the slums by 1982.  We will continue our programme to improve older houses and will give extra incentives for the selective improvement of areas of bad housing stress. Legislation will be carried through to give greater emphasis to the housing needs of inner urban areas.  We will strengthen action to cope with homelessness in areas of special need by co-operation with the local authorities in the efficient use of existing permanent and temporary accommodation and the provision of specially designed hostels.  We intend to pay particular attention to the housing needs of the elderly and the disabled who often need sheltered housing.  Our Housing Finance Act has, for the first time, brought fairness between one tenant and another by concentrating help with the rent on those areas and those families who most need it. Today, by law, and for the first time, every family in a rented home - whether council or private, unfurnished or furnished - can get such help if they need it.  This help has to be paid for. This has meant rent increases for the better off tenants who had hitherto often been enjoying bigger subsidies than many poorer families. But with nearly two million tenants already receiving rent rebates or allowances, a large number of families are now paying less rent than before the Act was passed.  At present, owner-occupiers with more rooms than they need are deterred from letting, unfurnished, any part of their houses. We will consider whether to remedy this by restoring to them the ability to regain possession. This would help provide more accommodation for renting.  We will keep security of tenure for all those who already have it.  We have announced the severest financial penalties ever on property profiteering, with special reference to empty office buildings.  Gains by individuals from the development value of property will now be subject to income tax, up to the top rate of 75 per cent, in place of the former flat rate of 30 per cent. As before, this will not apply to the principal home of an owner-occupier. Development gains by companies will be taxed as income at the full 40 per cent Corporation Tax rate, instead of 30 per cent. For the first time unrealised gains from property will be taxed by treating the first letting as a disposal for tax purposes.  We are also committed to taking new powers to deal with empty office premises. These will enable the Minister to take possession of, and manage, premises that have been unoccupied for more than two years. In addition, local authorities will be empowered to levy rates on unoccupied buildings at up to 100 per cent, and at a higher rate than this for certain empty commercial premises.  We wholly reject Labour's policy of preventing any further extension of freehold home-ownership by the nationalisation of every acre of land for new building.  IMPROVING THE ENVIRONMENT  Right at the start of the last Parliament we set up, for the first time, a Department of the Environment, which remains the only such ministry in the world with so wide a range of powers and resources. As a result, we are now acknowledged world leaders in environmental action in caring for towns, cities, villages, rivers and the countryside.  Conservative policy is to protect our environment where it is good, and to improve it where it is not good enough. We have already done much to achieve this. The Green Belt has been greatly extended. More than 100 new country parks have been opened since 1970. 'Operation Eyesore' has improved the local environment in thousands of towns and villages. Millions more trees have been planted. For every acre of derelict land cleared each year under Labour, we have cleared over three. We have set up a Nature Conservancy Council.  Clean air policy was at a standstill when Labour left office; we have more than doubled the number of Smoke Control Orders, bringing clean air and more sunlight to millions more people, especially in the North. Labour neglected the rivers - we have been improving their condition at an average rate of nearly three miles a week.  To reduce, still further, pollution of all kinds, we shall carry forward our legislation to cut down noise and establish quiet zones in urban areas; to accelerate the cleaning up of our rivers and estuaries; to curb fumes and smoke from vehicles; and to deal more efficiently with waste, especially toxic waste. We shall encourage the recycling of waste so as to conserve scarce resources and reduce imports.  We shall further extend and protect the Green Belt.  We shall strengthen the legislation necessary to protect and extend conservation areas, protect historic buildings and their gardens, control demolition, and preserve more carefully trees and archeological sites.  To supplement conservation areas in the towns and cities, we shall empower local authorities to designate environmental and amenity areas in all parts of the country.  We shall continue our drive to bring derelict land back into beneficial use. We shall further strengthen the Countryside Commission.  TRANSPORT  Continued growth of traffic has brought with it problems as well as advantages; and has in particular made necessary an increasing reliance on public transport. We have recently announced a massive five-year programme for the railways to provide a modern network with a secure future and the opportunity to regain freight traffic from the roads.  We shall modify the bus licensing system so as to give greater freedom for new forms of local transport in country areas, while safeguarding existing services.  We are already working to establish a system of lorry routes to keep heavy vehicles out of towns and villages and away from narrow country lanes where they have no business to he. With this as our priority, we shall complete the major road network as soon as the economic situation allows.  We have given the new county authorities powers to enable them to fix their own transport strategies and priorities.  We will continue to take all possible steps to diminish noise and other nuisances caused by new roads and the traffic which uses them.  BETTER EDUCATION  Conservatives have accorded high priority in the national budget to the needs of education. Above all we are concerned to provide not merely more education but better education. Better education is not only a matter of resources. It is a matter of standards and of attitudes.  We have advanced in every sector of education but have attached special importance to primary schools, believing that it is the early years that so often determine a child's future progress. In the next Parliament we shall continue to give priority to the early years of education.  We shall gradually extend free nursery schooling throughout the country so that within ten years it should be available for all three- and four-year-old children whose parents wish them to have it. We shall encourage pre-school playgroups; their emphasis on involving the parent is particularly valuable.  Our second priority will continue to be special schools for the handicapped. We have substantially increased the building programme for new schools. Work will soon begin on the enquiry into special education which was announced at the end of 1973.  In secondary education we shall continue to judge local education authorities' proposals for changing the character of schools on their merits, paying special regard to the wishes of parents and the retention of parental choice. We believe it to be educationally unwise to impose a universal system of comprehensive education on the entire country. Local education authorities should allow genuine scope for parental choice, and we shall continue to use our powers to give as much choice as possible.  We will defend the fundamental right of parents to spend their money on their children's education should they wish to do so.  We shall continue to support the direct grant schools. They have helped to provide increased opportunities for able children irrespective of their parents' means.  We shall maintain the right of parents to choose denominational education for their children if they so wish.  The expansion of further and higher education will be less rapid than planned because of the reduced demand for places and the prevailing economic circumstances, but numbers will continue to increase. The review of students' grants is proceeding and we shall continue to improve the parental income scale so that parents on a given income will pay less towards the grant.  As soon as economic circumstances permit, we will improve the opportunities for adult education in the light of the Russell Report.  We believe that the aims of the Youth Service should be more clearly defined. We shall, therefore, be discussing its future development with the local authorities and voluntary bodies who mostly provide this service, and aim to ensure that decisions about the future of the Service take fully into account the views of the young people themselves. Given the right impetus, the Youth Service can do a great deal to widen the scope for young people to play a full and constructive part in local affairs and activities wherever they live and work.  Because of our concern over reading standards in schools we have set up an enquiry under Sir Alan Bullock to report on all aspects of the teaching of English, including the written and spoken word. The conclusions are expected later in the year.  A research study on mathematical standards is also in hand.  We share the public concern about indiscipline and truancy. Investigations are being conducted into these problems, and we shall examine their findings as a matter of urgency.  Higher standards of education can only be achieved through more and better trained teachers. There are now some 60,000 more teachers in the schools than there were three years ago; we are carrying out the objectives of the James Report, which was itself set up as a result of a promise in our last manifesto.  We wish to move the debate away from the kind of school which children attend and concentrate on the kind of education they receive.  THE ARTS, BROADCASTING AND RECREATION  We shall continue to give the fullest support and encouragement to the arts, on which we are already spending &pound;50 million a year, more in fact than any previous government. At a time when economic stringency is necessarily limiting our material objectives it is more important than ever to improve the quality of life.  The arts must be centred on the nation not on the capital. Generous grants have gone to the regions in the past. Major arts centres will be established in Cardiff and Edinburgh.  In accordance with the pledge in our 1970 election manifesto, we are introducing a network of independent local radio stations, under the general supervision of the Independent Broadcasting Authority, with local newspaper participation.  Four of these stations are already in operation. We will bring forward proposals for the allocation of a fourth TV channel when economic circumstances permit.  We shall give further impetus to the Sports Council, whose powers and funds we have already greatly expanded. Professional football clubs as well as amateur sports organisations will be encouraged to join with local authorities and voluntary bodies in the redevelopment of town centre grounds for multi-purpose recreational needs.  PROTECTING THE RIGHTS OF THE INDIVIDUAL  The rights of the individual citizen need to be protected both against the power of the State and against other large and powerful bodies - whether commercial undertakings, trade unions, or any other centre of power.  We have recognised this need in our measures so far, and will continue to do so in the next Parliament.  We have acted decisively to protect the individual consumer. We have passed the Fair Trading Act to increase the powers of the new Monopolies and Mergers Commission and set up a Director-General of Fair Trading, under the Act, to deal with unfair trading practices of all kinds. We have legislated to impose stricter standards on insurance companies. We have, for the first time, appointed a Cabinet Minister for Consumer Affairs, and have introduced new legislation to prevent the consumer from having his legal rights undermined by the small print of so-called 'guarantees'. We have also legislated against the abuse known as pyramid selling. We have made it easier for consumers to get cheap and speedy settlement of small claims in the County Courts.  In the next Parliament, we shall continue to act in defence of the consumer over a broad front. We will act to improve the effectiveness of the nationalised industry consumer councils, to prevent confusion over metrication by insisting on specific unit pricing of goods in the shops, and in a wide range of other fields. In particular, we shall bring forward the Consumer Credit Bill, which will require hire purchase agreements to show the true rate of interest, prevent the unsolicited mailing of credit cards, and, in general, comprehensively reform the law on consumer credit.  We shall carry through our proposals for new legislation to reform company law by requiring of companies a much fuller disclosure of information to the individual - whether shareholder, employee or a member of the general public. By this measure, we will make British free enterprise the most open in the world. We will have created a system of free enterprise more socially responsible to the public, and with the power of the consumer greatly enhanced.  We have appointed a Health Service Commissioner or 'ombudsman' to investigate individual complaints about the National Health Service. We will be introducing a similar system for complaints against local authorities.  Citizens' rights in Britain are far more extensive than most citizens' awareness of those rights. This is particularly serious in the deprived central areas of many of our large cities. In these and other 'stress' areas we shall set up comprehensive advice centres, readily accessible to those who need help.  We have substantially improved the arrangements for consulting the public in advance of major planning decisions, such as large redevelopment schemes and the route to be followed by road schemes.  We have greatly extended the scope of compensation payable to those whose property is adversely affected by developments such as road schemes. We have provided for special extra compensation payments where a home-owner or a tenant loses his home as a result of development.  We shall also reform the licensing laws in the light both of the Erroll Report and of public reaction to it.  We have legislated to remove discrimination against women over a wide range of the law.  We have introduced equal rights of guardianship for women.  We have taken special steps to ensure that movement towards equal pay for women is not held back by the provisions of our counter-inflation policy.  We have improved the enforcement of maintenance payments to divorced or deserted wives.  We will introduce major new legislation to end discrimination against women at work, and to set up an Equal Opportunities Commission to investigate other aspects of discrimination against women, and to recommend further action.  We have taken steps to bring about more effective co-ordination of the work of local authority social workers, doctors, teachers and all relevant professional staff in detecting and preventing the ill-treatment of small children. We will urgently study the report of the Committee of Enquiry into the death of Maria Colwell, to see what further measures may be needed.  We shall strengthen existing safeguards in relation to the adoption of children, following broadly the recommendations of the Houghton Report.  We shall introduce a reform of the abortion law, in the light of the forth coming Lane Committee Report.  We will also, where necessary, act to ease restraints on publication under the present laws of contempt of court and defamation where these restraints do not infringe the rights of the individual. We will bring forward proposals to preserve the privacy of the citizen against unauthorised or unjustifiable intrusion, in the light of the Younger Report.  Other achievements and proposals concerned with the rights of the individual citizen appear elsewhere in this manifesto. Indeed the preservation and enhancement of individual freedom within a framework of responsibility is an underlying theme of all Conservative policy.  It is expressed in our determination to keep taxation as low as possible, so as to give the individual wage-earner greater freedom to spend or save what he earns as he thinks fit; in our Industrial Relations Act that gives new rights to individual trade unionists; in our proposals for giving employees a right of participation in the firms for which they work; in the importance we attach to parental choice in education; and in a housing policy that emphasises the freedom and independence that comes from home-ownership.  LOCAL GOVERNMENT  We have carried through the most important reforms of local government this century. We will continue those reforms by the appointment of local ombudsmen.  We will review the electoral provisions for London boroughs in the context of the arrangements for the rest of the country.  We favour a frank disclosure of local government finances to the people; for example, the publication by each local authority of a Balance Sheet, a Budget Statement, and annual spending programmes. Local government services have continued to expand during our term of office, but we have increased central Government's help to the ratepayers to meet the costs of that expansion. We have substantially increased rate relief to the householder. Three million rate- payers will benefit from the more generous rate rebate scheme we have introduced.  We will, if necessary, change the law and practice relating to the conduct of members and officers in local government wherever the possibility arises of a conflict between their official positions and their private interests.  We will strengthen and improve the regional offices of Government. Local authorities and the regional economic planning councils will be encouraged to work more closely together so that the views and needs of the regions can more effectively influence national decisions.  We are studying the Report of the Kilbrandon Commission.  We are publishing separate Manifestos for Scotland and Wales.  LAW AND ORDER  Protection of the law-abiding citizen is a prime duty of the State. We have given higher priority to the support of law and order and the reduction of crime than any Government for many years. The overall volume of crime in the country has been dropping for the first time for nearly 20 years, and although within this total, crimes of violence are still rising alarmingly there are some encouraging signs even in this field - for example, the marked drop in 1973 in the number of robberies and muggings.  We have increased and strengthened the police force. In real terms we are spending today over 15 per cent more on the police than in 1970. For the first time we have over 100,000 men and women in the Police Forces of England and Wales and they are backed up by an extra 7,000 civilians.  We have reviewed the powers available to the Courts. We have increased the maximum penalties for offences involving the use of firearms and for crimes of vandalism. We have widened and strengthened the powers of the Courts to order convicted criminals to compensate their victims. We have provided new non-custodial forms of punishment whereby offenders can be required to do useful work for the community.  We have substantially increased the size of the Probation Service and will continue to do so.  In the next Parliament we shall continue to give the highest priority to policies aimed at reducing crime and supporting freedom under the law. The further strengthening of the police will be of particular importance.  We shall maintain the impetus of our measures of law reform. We shall review the law against violent crime in the light of the Criminal Law Revision Committee's forthcoming report on offences against the person. We will further improve the legal aid and advisory services.  We will place the Criminal Injuries Compensation Scheme, first introduced by a Conservative Government, on a permanent statutory basis.  We shall provide for the introduction of an independent element in the procedure for complaints against the police.  The growing display of indecent material in public places gives offence to many people. Accordingly, we shall bring forward our Bill to prohibit this, and to tighten up the law against sending through the post unsolicited matter of an indecent nature.  We shall reform and liberalize the Official Secrets Acts, while retaining those provisions essential for the protection of national security.  Having reviewed the law on picketing, we have come to the conclusion that the present law as recently clarified by the Courts is adequate both to protect the right of genuinely peaceful picketing and to penalise abuse. But we believe that the lawful limits to peaceful picketing need to be more clearly and widely known. We shall therefore publish a document setting out the law on this subject in the belief that this will be an assistance both to the observance and enforcement of the law.  We deplore the encouragement to politically-motivated law-breaking given by the Labour Party's pledge to remove, retrospectively, the penalties incurred by Clay Cross councillors for serious breaches of the Housing Finance Act. A Conservative Government will continue to uphold the rule of law.  As a people, we live in the freest democracy in the world, with a tradition of individual liberty within the law and of peaceful change. If that tradition is to be maintained, as we are determined that it shall be, it must not be abused. In particular, we reaffirm our conviction that a criminal act does not cease to be criminal by virtue of being committed ostensibly for political ends.  IMMIGRATION AND RACE RELATIONS  By passing the 1971 Immigration Act, against the combined opposition of the Labour and Liberal Parties, we have provided the country with the necessary means for preventing any further large scale permanent immigration and also with important new powers for preventing illegal immigration. The Act became fully operative in January 1973 and its effects in reinforcing all the other administrative action we have taken are already becoming evident. Thus the number of new immigrants admitted in 1973 was the lowest since control was first introduced by the previous Conservative Government more than a decade ago.  We intend that this decline shall continue. At the same time within this declining figure we are honouring our obligations to the categories of people in the Commonwealth for whom we have special responsibilities - namely the close dependent relatives of immigrants settled here lawfully before the new Act came into force and those people who, because of our imperial past, possess citizen ship of this country and no other.  We have also set in hand a review of British nationality law, and dependent on its outcome, new legislation to replace present British Nationality Acts may be one of the measures required in the life of the next Parliament.  When we came to power in 1970, there were about 1.5 million coloured people lawfully and permanently settled in this country. The great majority are here to stay. Their children are being born and brought up here and Britain is the only country they know as their own. The harmony of our society in the future depends to an important extent on the white majority and the coloured minority living and working together on equal terms and with equal opportunities. We shall therefore pursue positive policies to promote good race relations.  The first need for this purpose was to reassure everyone that new immigration was being brought down to a small and inescapable minimum. But beyond that we shall take further action to improve conditions in the stress areas in the centres of many of our industrial towns and cities where immigrant communities frequently concentrate and where the local inhabitants have long had to endure poor housing and a deprived environment.  WORKING FOR PEACE IN NORTHERN IRELAND  For the best part of five years now, our British soldiers have carried out their duties superbly. Despite every kind of difficulty and provocation, they have succeeded, with exemplary restraint, in restoring and maintaining a substantial measure of law and order, in crushing the terrorist IRA leadership in Northern Ireland, and in creating the conditions that have made a political solution possible. No other army in the world could have achieved what they have done: no praise is too high for them.  In March 1972 conditions in Northern Ireland had reached the point where we were obliged temporarily to suspend the Province's Parliament and institute a period of direct rule from Westminster, appointing a Secretary of State for Northern Ireland. After almost two years of unceasing effort, the extremists were isolated and a reconciliation was brought about between the responsible political leaders of the Protestant and Catholic communities in the Province.  This eventually resulted in a successful agreement at the tripartite meeting at Sunningdale in December 1973.  In spite of the violence in Northern Ireland, industry there has shown a remarkable resilience. In 1973 unemployment dropped substantially, the number of industrial disputes was the lowest for a decade, and the rate of growth of industrial production was the highest in the United Kingdom. These achievements were made possible by a massive programme of Government aid and by the united determination of workers and management in the Province.  On January 1, 1974 the new Northern Ireland Executive took office. It is still a tender plant. But the fact remains that those who used to be political opponents are today working together on the new Executive in Northern Ire land to bring a better life to their strife-torn Province.  This has been possible, above all, as a result of firm but fair Government action which has succeeded, against all the odds, in mobilising the silent majority of moderate opinion in Northern Ireland to assert itself against extremists of all kinds.  In the next Parliament we shall continue, in the same spirit, to build on the progress we have already achieved.  BRITAIN, EUROPE AND THE WORLD  The prime objective of our foreign policy is to preserve peace and maintain the security and prosperity of the British nation. In order to achieve this we need friends and allies. In the last 4 years, sometimes in very difficult circumstances, Britain has made or consolidated friendships in the Far East, China, the Indian Sub-Continent, Africa and the American Continent. Progress has lately been made in re-establishing a proper relationship with the Soviet Union.  A successful Commonwealth Conference has recently been held in Ottawa.  Above all, by successfully negotiating British membership of the European Community, we achieved a major national objective which had eluded successive British Governments of both Parties for more than a decade.  We have now been a member of the Community for a little over a year. While it is therefore far too soon to attempt a complete assessment of the implications for Britain of this historic step forward, it is already clear that we are better able to secure our national interests both economic and political within the Community than would have been possible had we remained outside. Firms throughout the country have felt the benefit of British membership for their export trade.  Every aspect of world affairs underlines the need for a Europe which is united and can carry the maximum weight in the councils of the world. What ever our internal differences, we must increasingly learn to speak strongly with one voice which can be heard among the greatest powers, and which can play its part in evolving mutually beneficial policies towards the rest of the world, including the developing countries. This is what membership of the Community is about. It means increasing economic strength for each member and above all the certainty that there will be partnership instead of rivalry and no more wars having their origin in Western Europe.  Meanwhile, by its very nature, the Community continues to develop and evolve. In particular, just as Britain has to adapt to the Community, so the Community has to adapt to Britain.  Since becoming a member, we have been a full and effective participant in the making of Community decisions. We have made it clear that we are not satisfied with every aspect of Community arrangements, and have sought - and will continue to seek - changes where these are desirable.  A Conservative Government will urge on our Community partners the need to extend the scope of Community action into industrial policy, technological collaboration and social and environmental questions. This is necessary if the full benefits of the larger market are to be reaped, and if we are to realise the full potential of the Community as an instrument for improving the life of the people.  We have already been instrumental in securing a decision in principle to set up a European Regional Development Fund, a considerable proportion of which will be devoted to helping the less prosperous regions of Britain. We have been pressing hard within the Community for a sizeable fund, and a decision is to be taken early this year.  The Community's Common Agricultural Policy provides British agriculture with very real opportunities for expansion. But in a number of ways the Common Agricultural Policy is now manifestly in need of reform; and we shall continue to work so that the necessary changes can be made.  The Conservative delegation to the European Assembly has already made a telling impact. We shall continue to work for ways in which the Community's institutions can be improved in order to make them more responsive to public opinion and to reinforce democratic control.  Meanwhile, we will ensure that Parliament at Westminster can play a full and effective part in the consideration of Community proposals in their formative stage.  Renegotiation of the Community in the sense of reforming its practice and redefining Britain's place in it, is a continuous process, which can only be con ducted from within, and in which we are already playing a full part. Renegotiation in the sense of British withdrawal, which is what a section of the Labour Party seeks, would be a disaster for which future generations would never forgive us.  Community membership has been of major importance for our foreign and defence policy as a whole, providing us with a new dimension and a new voice in world affairs. We reaffirm our full support for the Atlantic Alliance within which we shall continue to seek still closer European co-operation in defence and procurement.  The problems presented to Europe and all the developed and developing countries by the increased price of oil need to be tackled both in Europe and through wider international consultation. A new understanding must be sought between consumers and producers in which plans for industrial development and investment to mutual advantage would play an important part.  We shall continue to play our full part in the United Nations. We shall continue to maintain close relations with our fellow-members of the Common wealth, based on a common heritage and mutual independence. We shall seek to play our part in helping economic development in the poorer parts of the world. It is essential for Britain as a trading nation that the momentum of development in the Third World should not slacken.  We remain committed to try to reach a settlement in Rhodesia in accordance with the five principles. We trust that, meanwhile, Europeans and Africans in Rhodesia will make rapid progress towards agreement on constitutional changes which would enable independence to be granted by the British Parliament and sanctions to be lifted.  We shall seek to help the cause of peace in the Middle East. We reaffirm our belief that the integrity of the State of Israel must be maintained, and at the same time we will continue to give our support for withdrawal from occupied territories, in accordance with the relevant resolutions of the United Nations.  We will continue to play a full part in the negotiations over Mutual and Balanced Force Reductions and in the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe where we will insist on some movement in the field of an increased flow of information and ideas and people between East and West. While progress towards détente must be our purpose we note with concern the continuing expansion of all branches of the Soviet armed forces - especially its rocket forces and its navies on the high seas. We therefore need to maintain the NATO alliance and ensure that it is sufficiently strong to deter any breach of the peace.  We shall maintain the effectiveness of the British nuclear deterrent.  We shall continue to ensure that the morale and effectiveness of our armed forces are maintained at the highest possible level. This is vital if we are to retain our security, which is essential to all our aspirations.  THE ALTERNATIVE - AND THE CHOICE  We have set out in this manifesto our proposals both for dealing with the grave crisis now facing the nation and for building, once the crisis is overcome, on the solid progress made before it broke.  We believe that these proposals - firm but fair, based on realism and moderation - are what the British people desire and the situation demands.  They are also utterly different from those of the Labour Party.  The Labour Party today faces the nation committed to a left-wing programme more dangerous and more extreme than ever before in its history.  This commitment to extremism is no accident. In part, it has occurred as a reaction against the manifest failure of its policies of gimmickry and so-called pragmatism when it was last in office.  But, even more, it has occurred because the moderates within Labour's ranks have lost control, and the real power in the Labour Party has been taken over, for the first time ever, by its extreme Left wing. And this in turn has been made possible by the dominance of a small group of power-hungry trade union leaders, whose creature the Labour Party has now become.  The Labour Party today is committed to massive increases in taxation for all - rich and poor alike - not simply as a means to an end, but as an end in itself.  It is pledged to increase income tax, not just for the 'rich', but for millions of ordinary wage and salary earners.  It has threatened to increase VAT on a wide range of household goods and services, which would bring particular hardship to those less well off.  It has promised to levy heavier taxes on the self-employed.  Labour's policy for industry is one of massive nationalisation on an unprecedented scale.  In addition to taking over a number of named industries, Labour is pledged to nationalise key firms in other industries and threatens to take over any profitable firm throughout manufacturing industry.  In what would remain of private industry, it is explicitly committed to taking power to issue arbitrary State 'directives' to any company and, if it sees fit, to put in a Government 'trustee' to run the firm.  It has also talked glibly of nationalising banks, building societies and insurance companies - which would mean taking over the savings of the people.  Labour is committed to an irresponsible programme of public expenditure, costing on its own admission some &pound;6,000 million a year, over and above the huge cost of its nationalisation plans. This was far in excess of what the national economy could afford even before the present crisis.  In education, it seeks doctrinaire uniformity throughout the State system, and would abolish the independent schools. It is similarly committed to abolishing freedom of choice in medical care.  It is committed to preventing any further extension of freehold home owner ship, by taking over all the land on which future homes can be built.  It is also committed to indemnifying, at the taxpayers' and ratepayers' expense, those law-breakers of whom it politically approves. Never before in its history has the Labour Party shown such open contempt for the rule of law.  The total effect of Labour's present policies would be to wreck the economy, undermine the free society, and accelerate the present inflation beyond the point of no return.  It has no effective policy whatever for dealing with the crucial problem of wage inflation. It is committed to abandoning the legally-backed pay and prices policy; but all it has to put in its place are the outdated and divisive nostrums of class warfare.  It is not surprising that the moderates in Labour's ranks, who formerly held the balance of power in their bitterly divided Party, opposed each and every one of these extremist policies. But on each and every occasion, the moderates were defeated by the now ascendant Left wing, and these policies became firm official commitments.  However slick the public relations smokescreen, this is the reality of declared Labour Party policy - and they mean what they said.  In short, the return of a Labour Government at the present time would be nothing short of a major national disaster.  The choice before the nation today, as never before, is a clear choice between moderation and extremism.  We therefore appeal, at this critical time in our country's affairs, for the support of the great moderate majority of the British people, men and women of all Parties and no Party, who reject extremism in any shape or form.  For extremism divides, while moderation unites; and it is only on the basis of national unity that the present crisis can be overcome and a better Britain built."
"Labour",197410,"BRITAIN WILL WIN WITH LABOR  FOREWORD BY  THE RT. HON. HAROLD WILSON, OBE, FRS, MP  In February we put before the British people our Manifesto, 'Labour's Way out of the Crisis'.  It was a programme for getting Britain back to work, for overcoming what was universally acknowledged to be the gravest economic crisis Britain had faced since the war. A programme to be carried out by a Government of all the people working together.  Labour formed the Government, got Britain back to work and showed our determination to fulfil the programme which we had put before the people. No post war British Government has achieved more in six months.  But at every turn we have found ourselves faced in Parliament by a majority which could, and did, coalesce to frustrate the policies we had put before the nation. What is still more serious has been the widespread expectation of an inevitable and early General Election, which created uncertainty in industry and the other institutions of our British society.  Soon the people must decide on the Government to whom they want to entrust the future of themselves and their families for the next five years.  They will judge each Party on its record in office, when it had the responsibility: on its record in honouring the pledges it had made to the country. On its willingness to undertake measures which would enlist the support and enthusiasm of our people in fighting the economic crisis.  They will judge on the policies which each Party puts forward, asking themselves which Party can best be trusted to make a reality of those policies.  They will judge not only on policies and records, but on the calibre and experience of the men and women who will be responsible for carrying out those policies. On their compassion and the understanding of the problems of ordinary families: on their determination to govern for, and with the sanction of, all of the people.  In February the country rejected, as we had urged, policies of confrontation and conflict and 'fight to a finish' philosophies. We put before the country the policy of the Social Contract.  We have shown that as a Government we are prepared to take the decisions that are needed to achieve economic and social justice without which this country can never unite.  The policies we have followed over the past six months, the policies which the next Labour Government will follow, are policies to strengthen the Social Contract.  It is not simply, or narrowly, an understanding about wages. It is about justice, equality, about concern for and protection of the lower paid, the needy, the pensioner and the handicapped in our society.  It is about fairness between one man and another, and between men and women. It is about economic justice between individuals and between regions. It is about co-operation and conciliation, not conflict and confrontation.  But more than that. What we as democratic socialists maintain is that when the going is toughest it is more than ever necessary to base our policies on social justice, to protect the weak, the poor, the disabled, to help those least able to help themselves, and to maintain and improve their living standards.  Other Parties which do not believe in fair shares deny themselves the right to call for equal sacrifices.  Injustice is the enemy of national unity.  The crisis we are facing demands a still greater emphasis on social justice, as well as economic justice, than at any time in this generation.  That is the inspiration underlying the policies set out in this Manifesto.  It carries forward the programme we set out in February. It builds on our achievements in fulfilling, in six months, so much of that programme. It sets out in much more detail the policies we then announced, proposals which have now been firmly rooted in our experience in government, and responsibly costed against the resources which as a nation we can afford.  This Manifesto, which is inspired by the idealism which has created our Movement, is now put before the country on the basis of the realism deriving from experience. It sets out what in our view is the only way to enable Britain to win through the crisis we now all face, and to share together, as one people, the fruits of the success we are determined to achieve.  HAROLD WILSON  Britain faces its most dangerous crisis since the war. The Labour Party makes no attempt to disguise this. On the contrary, at the time of the February election, we took the British people into our confidence and shared the realities of our daunting problems. We inherited a three-day week, unlit streets, unheated homes and work-places. And worst of all, a wounded national economy, made all the more serious by the socially divisive policies of the previous Conservative Government, with its deliberate confrontation with the organised working people of our country. The Conservatives created a society in which people who made money were more honoured than men and women who earned their wages.  This crisis for our country was all the more desperate because it was set in the context of a continuing world upheaval. Most of the world is still staggering from the enormous increases in the price of oil - the most important basic commodity in modern industrial and agricultural society.  We come with confidence before the public to ask for a strong mandate for the policies drawn from 'Labour's Programme for Britain' set out in our February manifesto, some of which have been spelled out in greater detail in White Papers published by the Government. No Government can get Britain moving by itself. A democratic Government must reflect the views of the people. And the people who vote for the Government must give their share of endeavour and concern - as well as their votes. But a Government can only ask these efforts from the men and women of this country if they can confidently see a vision of a fair and just society. Why should a coal miner dig extra coal for a few pounds more while he has seen property speculators grow wealthy looking at empty office blocks? A strong new Labour Government, with the agreement and co-operation of the British people, can make constructive, but not painless progress towards building a fair society.  This election is inevitable since no clear majority emerged in February. Despite its minority position the Labour Government have made a good start. Now we ask for the return of a Labour Government, with a working majority, so that we can continue to tackle the great problems facing Britain. We have to come to the men and women of our country and ask for their mandate for industrial and social reconstruction. We need national support for a steady will for a new society. In fact we are asking your help to carry through policies which will work for international peace and co-operation and at the same time create at home effective measures of economic and social reconstruction.  It is only with a sense of unity that we shall win through. But we cannot expect this from a Conservative Government - nor from any Conservative-Liberal coalition. The Tory Party is, by its own statements, deeply divided about what policies to put before the electorate. Neither the Tories nor a Conservative-Liberal coalition can bring a united and decisive programme of solution to contemporary problems.  Why can't we accept the idea of a coalition to meet the nation's crisis? Because what our country needs in this crisis is a government with a clear-cut understanding of the nation's problems and the ability to decide quickly and effectively how to deal with them. A coalition government, by its very nature, tends to trim its policies and fudge its decisions, and in present circumstances that just won't do. If we believe, as we must, in our own independent political philosophies, there is no meeting point between us and those with quite different philosophies, and it would be a cruel farce to suggest that the future of the country would be helped by shuffling, compromising administration.  We want to be frank with you. The regeneration of our economy isn't going to be easy, even with a Labour Government. The next two or three years are going to be difficult for us all. There will be no easy times and no easy pickings for anyone.  We put forward in this manifesto a list of improvements we want to make in society. We put them forward in good faith; but many of them cost money, and we understand perfectly well - and we believe you will, too - that the timing of them will depend on how quickly and how completely we get on top of the economic problems.  But Labour doesn't go along with the prophets of doom and gloom. We have great confidence in the British people. If you give us your full backing over the difficult two or three years ahead we shall weather the storm and get back on the right course.  PROMISES AND PRIORITIES  The Labour Government has kept the promises made at the election in February. From the day we took office we acted. We increased pensions to &pound;10 and &pound;16. We froze rents. We gave security to people who live in furnished tenancies. We repealed the divisive Industrial Relations Act and we replaced confrontation by conciliation. We restrained the rise in the cost of living by our subsidies on essential foods and price controls. We gave loans to the building societies to help house-buyers - who would otherwise have faced mortgage rates of 13%. We allocated more money to local councils to build or buy homes.  The Government have published plans for the public owner ship of development land which will get rid of the major inflationary element in the cost of building; for public control and participation in North Sea oil; for greater accountability and the extension of public ownership in industry; for beginning the redistribution of wealth by new taxation on the better-off - while at the other end of the scale a million and a half people have been taken out of liability to any income tax. We have published radical and detailed proposals for pensions and for bringing help as of right to the disabled. New rights for women and our determination to implement equal pay have been announced. And we have begun in earnest the promised renegotiation of the Conservatives' disadvantageous terms of entry to the Common Market.  As at the last election, we are not making any promises which we cannot keep. We do not believe in electoral bribes - these are an insult to the intelligence and realism of the public. The priorities we set out here are part of a programme for a five year term of office. Much of what we want to do will take longer because of all the heavy spade-work which has to be done to create the economic strength on which all else depends.  THE SOCIAL CONTRACT  At the heart of this manifesto and our programme to save the nation lies the Social Contract between the Labour Government and the trade unions, an idea derided by our enemies, but certain to become widely accepted by those who genuinely believe in government by consent - that is, in the democratic process itself as opposed to the authoritarian and bureaucratic system of wage control imposed by the Heath Government and removed by Labour.  The Social Contract is no mere paper agreement approved by politicians and trade unions. It is not concerned solely or even primarily with wages. It covers the whole range of national policies. It is the agreed basis upon which the Labour Party and the trade unions define their common purpose.  Labour describes - as we did in our February manifesto at the time of the last election and as we do again at this one - the firm and detailed commitments which will be fulfilled in the field of social policy, in the fairer sharing of the nation's wealth, in the determination to restore and sustain full employment. The unions in response confirm how they will seek to exercise the newly restored right of free collective bargaining. Naturally the trade unions see their clearest loyalty to their own members. But the Social Contract is their free acknowledgment that they have other loyalties - to the members of other unions too, to pensioners, to the lower-paid, to invalids, to the community as a whole.  It is these wide-ranging hopes and obligations which the General Council of the TUC described in its declaration of June 26 and which were overwhelmingly approved by the Congress on September 4. This is the Social Contract which can re-establish faith in the working of Britain' 5 democracy in the years ahead.  INFLATION  The first priority must be a determined attack on inflation and the appalling overseas deficit which We inherited. Inflation is a World-Wide problem and there are no easy answers, but for us the crisis was made worse than it need have been because of the financial disasters Labour inherited from the Tory Government.  Inflation is one of the greatest economic perils we face. It afflicts all the countries of the world. From Japan to France, from the United States to Britain, prices are rising at between 15% and 25% a year. Oil, the lifeblood of industry and transport, costs four times what it did a year ago; wheat, feedgrains, sugar and other imported foodstuffs, nearly double. These powerful inflationary forces cannot be wholly mastered by any single government acting alone. It will require international co-operation both to curb inflation and to avoid a slump.  But there are things the Government can - and must - do. We were elected last February to govern a Britain that had been greatly weakened by the policies of the Conservatives. The Heath Government allowed a huge deficit to accumulate on our balance of payments, even before the oil price rises hit us. It borrowed and printed hundreds of millions of pounds at home, fuelling the fires of inflation; it let our scarce resources go into office blocks, luxury flats and property speculation, at a time that Britain badly needed investment in industry and in housing for rent. Britain, in February 1974, was in bad shape to withstand the economic hurricane.  We reject entirely the policy put forward by some Tories of fighting inflation by throwing millions of people out of work.  We are doing everything within our power to curb inflation. And where rising prices are outside our control, as with imports of oil and raw materials, we have sought to protect the least well-off, the pensioner and the low-paid, for whom inflation is not just a worry but a nightmare.  We have:  - Stopped printing money to finance unnecessary expenditure;  - Cut VAT from 10% to 8%;  - Reduced gross profit margins by 10% and agreed with the food trade to concentrate profit cuts on essential foods;  - Frozen rents and stabilised mortgage rates;  - Subsidised basic foods - bread, flour, butter, cheese, milk and tea- in a way that gives most benefit to the least well-off;  - Taken powers to set maximum prices for subsidised foods; laid down a minimum of three months between price rises, and stopped' the 'sticky label' trick;  - Set up a National Consumer Agency, backed by a net work of local consumer advice centres.  We shall:  - Provide detailed information to shoppers on where to get value for money;  - renegotiate the Common Agricultural Policy of the Common Market to make sure shoppers get secure supplies of food at fair prices;  - Introduce unit pricing for meat, fish, fruit and vegetables;  - Put teeth into nationalised industry consumer councils and finance them independently.  OIL CRISIS We shall continue to give high priority to our overseas trade. We have to. At the centre of our national and international crisis is the enormous increase in oil prices which is costing this country an extra £2,500 million this year.  We must get rid of the non-oil deficit we inherited from the previous Tory Government, while tackling in co-operation with other countries also affected, the balance of payments and currency problems created by the fourfold increase in the price of oil.  AGRICULTURE  Labour will encourage the maximum economic production of food by the farming and fishing industries. We inherited from the Tories an extremely grave crisis in the agricultural industry - with extremely high feed costs, and the cereals sector succeeding at the expense of the livestock sector.  A Tory Government negotiated entry into the EEC and removed the long-term guarantees to the livestock industry. The Intervention System of the Common Agricultural Policy has not worked. Labour insists that there must be a new approach, with a clear emphasis on national aids, and that we must be able to provide suitable guarantees to our farmers.  We have already taken urgent action:-  - A special subsidy on pigs, representing an injection of £30 million to the UK pig industry;  - The near doubling of the calf subsidy, providing an extra £35 million a year.  - A new beef premium, an arrangement which gives another £40 million to the producers;  - The restoration of the lime subsidy which was abolished by the Tories - worth £5 million a year.  - A temporary subsidy on the oil used for heating glass- houses - which injects a further £7 million into the horticultural industry.  We will, in addition, introduce in the very near future, considerable help to the dairy industry.  Our long-term objective is to secure the expansion of the industry. We intend to continue our discussions with the  Farmers' Unions - and the agricultural workers - with the dual objective of drawing up a meaningful longer term expansion and of determining the means whereby this can be achieved.  EMPLOYMENT AND EXPANSION  In the long run, a nation, like a family, can only live on what it earns. If we want to maintain our standard of living and protect people's jobs and give a boost to our deprived regions, we must get industry to produce more and export more.  This is going to demand some radical changes. The Tories and their Aims of Industry friends say we ought to leave things as they are. But things as they are consist of lower productivity, less competitiveness and much lower investment than other countries. If we leave things as they are we shall go on, as we have done for years, slipping behind other nations. The industrial sector of our economy is suffering from grave and chronic debilitation and that sort of illness cannot be cured with a couple of aspirin tablets. We need a new deal.  The present Labour Government has made a start on this task. It has stemmed the runaway rise in interest rates. It has doubled the Regional Employment Premium and listed new development and special development areas for extra help. Our exports are doing well, and outside the inflated oil bill, we are paying for more of our imports with exports.  But there is still a long way to go. In our February manifesto we put forward proposals for an extension of the public sector where it is most needed, and for a new relationship between the Government and the large privately-owned companies which will do much to regenerate British industry.  We stand firmly by those proposals. The Government has published a White Paper describing how they will work:-  1 A new and urgent Industry Act will provide for a system of Planning Agreements between the Government and key companies to ensure that the plans of those companies are in harmony with national needs and objectives and that Government financial assistance is deployed where it will be most effectively used. Wherever we give direct aid to a company out of public funds we shall reserve the right to take a proportionate share of the ownership of the company; and wherever possible this public support will be channelled through the Planning Agreements System.  2 In addition to our plans for taking into common ownership the land required for development, we shall substantially extend public enterprise by taking over mineral rights. We shall also take ports, ship-building, ship-repairing and marine engineering, and the aircraft industries into public ownership and control. We shall not confine the extension of the public sector to loss-making and subsidised industries. We shall set up a National Enterprise Board to administer publicly-owned share-holdings: to extend public ownership into profitable manufacturing industry by acquisitions, partly or wholly, of individual firms; to stimulate investment; to create employment in areas of high unemployment; to encourage industrial democracy; to promote industrial efficiency; to increase exports and reduce our dependence on imports; to combat private monopoly; and to prevent British industries from passing into unacceptable foreign control.  We do not accept the negative policies adopted by the previous Tory Government towards the nationalised industries. We shall restore to our public enterprises the assets and licences which the Tory Government took away from them, and will encourage and help them diversify into new industries. We shall bring forward early proposals to ensure that banking and insurance make a better contribution to the national economy.  Regional development will be further encouraged by new public enterprise, by assistance to private industry on a selective basis, and new Regional Planning Machinery, along the lines set out in 'Labour's Programme 1973'. We will set up Scottish and Welsh Development Agencies. Moreover, the revenues from the North Sea and Celtic Sea oil will help us to improve employment in Scotland, Wales and the English regions in need of development.  We shall transform the existing Manpower Services Commission into a powerful body, responsible for the development and execution of a comprehensive manpower policy. Redundant workers must have an automatic right to retraining, with redundancy leading not to unemployment, but to retraining and job changing.  ENERGY  The discovery of oil off our shores dramatically changes not only the country's energy prospects, but our whole economic future. Because its importance cannot be over-estimated it is essential that its development should be under public control in the interests of the whole community, and with regard to the future. The Labour Government will:-  Take majority participation in all future oil licences and negotiate to achieve majority state participation in existing licences.  Set up a British National Oil Corporation to. enable the Government to exercise participation rights; to play an active role in the future development, exploration and exploitation of offshore oil; and to engage in the refining and the distribution of oil. Its headquarters will be in Scotland.  Impose a substantial extra tax on the oil companies' profits from the North Sea - and plug the loopholes in existing taxation.  Take new powers to control the pace of depletion, pipelines, exploration and development - and to protect the environment; and nationalise the land needed for the oil platform construction sites.  Set up new Development Agencies in Scotland and in Wales - financed by the United Kingdom exchequer - with extra funds to reflect the revenue from offshore oil.  After years of Tory indecision Labour has - within a few months - laid the foundation for a coherent energy policy involving coal, gas, nuclear power and electricity as well as oil. We have agreed an additional investment of £600 million for the coal mines. We have backed British technology with a programme of British reactors for the next generation of our power stations. INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS  We promised to repeal the Tory Industrial Relations Act and this promise has been fulfilled. The last minute amendments inserted into our Trade Union and Labour Relations Act, by the coalition of Tories, Liberals and the Lords, will be removed in the first session of the new Parliament.  But the repeal of the Tory Act was only the first step. Our aim is to make industry democratic - to develop joint control and action by management and workers across the whole range of industry, commerce and the public services.  This objective involves strong trade union organisation and widening the scope of collective bargaining. In addition, however, it will mean the provision of new rights for workers through changes in company law.  First, We will introduce an Employment Protection Bill - to provide extensive new rights for workers covering such issues as union membership, apprentices' training and conditions, the guaranteed week, maternity leave, safeguards on redundancy and employers' bankruptcy, to give new rights to unions in collective bargaining, including new safeguards for peaceful picketing, to reform the Wages Councils and establish a key role for the new Conciliation and Arbitration Service in helping to get rid of low pay.  Second, we will introduce new legislation to help forward our plans for a radical extension of industrial democracy in both the private and public sectors. This will involve major changes in company law and in the statutes which govern the nationalised industries and the public services.  Measures will also be taken to tackle the evils created by private employment agencies and to deal with abuses of labour-only contracting.  SOCIAL JUSTICE  We believe that men and women will respond to difficult challenges if there is a sense of underlying fairness in society.  Labour believes, for instance, that taxation must be used to achieve a major redistribution of both wealth and income. The March Budget took 1½ million men and women out of income tax altogether and concentrated tax increases on the better off. It also blocked dozens of tax loopholes and announced that a new Capital Transfers Tax would operate from the date of the Budget.  The next Labour Government will introduce an annual tax on wealth above £100,000. We will also legislate for the introduction of the Capital Transfers Tax - which will, for the first time this century, make the Estate Duty an effective tax on inherited wealth. Labour will also offer retired people and young couples saving for a home a form of National Savings the value of which will be guaranteed against inflation. SOCIAL SECURITY The Labour Government's first step was to increase pensions to £10 for a single person and £16 for a married couple: a record increase in record time. Corresponding increases for widows, invalids and others on supplementary benefit have been enacted. This is a real increase which more than compensates for the rise in prices. The Labour Government has already committed itself by law to maintain and improve the real gain for existing pensioners by reviewing pensions and other benefits regularly and by linking future increases to the rise in wages and not just prices. The Labour Government will: Pay another £10 Christmas bonus this year to those who have retired and this time will include invalidity pensioners and those receiving attendance allowances, unemployability supplements or widows' benefits. Replace the unjust Tory pension scheme with our recently announced long-term plan for adequate earnings-related pensions for everyone, fully protected against inflation. This will free future pensioners from the need for means-tested assistance; give equality of treatment to women; include invalidity pensioners; and give special help to the older workers and the low-paid. Attack family poverty, by increasing family allowances and extending them to the first child through a new scheme of child credits payable to the mother. We are also examining other ways of helping one-parent families. Help disabled people who are outside the National Insurance scheme through a new non-contributory benefit for those of working age and for disabled housewives. We shall introduce an Invalid Care Allowance for those who give up their jobs to look after a severely disabled relative and a new mobility allowance for severely disabled people Whether or not they can drive a car.  THE NATIONAL HEALTH SERVICE  Labour created the National Health Service and is deter mined to defend it. Immense damage has been done to it by Tory cuts in public expenditure, by the Tory Government's policy or rigid pay control and by the upheaval of Tory reorganisation on undemocratic lines. Labour has already injected more money into the Service; published proposals for greater democratic participation in its running and above all, taken steps to end the exploitation of nurses and other workers in the Service and to see that at last they receive the rewards they so richly deserve.  Labour has already relieved women over 60 and children under 16 from prescription charges and strengthened provision for dental care under the National Health Service by freezing the level of dental charges for patients while increasing dentists' fees. Labour has reversed the Tory proposal to impose charges on Family Planning.  It has started its attack on queue-jumping by increasing the charge for private pay beds in National Health Service hospitals and is now working out a scheme for phasing private beds out of these hospitals.  The Labour Government will reduce regional inequality of standards; put the emphasis on prevention and primary care and give a clear priority to spending on services for the mentally ill and mentally handicapped. It will continue the progressive elimination of prescription charges and phase out private pay beds from National Health Service hospitals.  THE RIGHT TO EDUCATION  The Labour Party believes that full opportunities for the education of our children, our young people and students of all ages are an essential part of a fair society and indispensable to the social contract. We have already asked local authorities to submit plans for comprehensive education by the end of the year, increased provision for nursery education and raised students' grants by 25%. The Labour Government realises the problems of many of our teachers and an independent inquiry has been set up into their pay. We have made an additional £1 1.8 million available to supplement teachers' pay in difficult areas and increased the school building programme we inherited. We have provided funds for new classes for adults who cannot read.  As in all our plans, economic restraints are bound to influence timing. But the next Labour Government will:  - End the II plus and other forms of selection for secondary education. Continue to give priority to nursery school and day care provision, full-time and part-time.  - Stop the present system of Direct Grant Schools and withdraw tax relief and charitable status from Public Schools, as a first step towards our long-term aim of phasing out fee paying in schools.  - Continue to move towards a fairer system of student grants.  - Provide increased opportunities for further education and training, including compulsory paid day release, especially for young people who leave school early.  - Legislate for an annual review and an annual report to Parliament on youth services.  Labour appointed the first ever Minister of Sport and Recreation and the first ever Minister for the Arts. We removed the museum charges introduced by the Tory Government, and we allocated greater resources to the Arts Council than ever before. We shall bring forward proposals to make the Arts Council more democratic and representative of people in the arts and in entertainment. We will continue to develop and improve the facilities for sport and leisure for all our citizens.  We will support the further development of the Open University, which was founded by a Labour Government and which has enriched the lives of thousands of people of all ages.  OUR HOMES, OUR LAND, OUR ENVIRONMENT  Everybody is entitled to a decent home at a price they can afford. This cannot be achieved in a free-for-all market, which has resulted in homelessness, over-crowding and squalor for thousands of our people. We have in a few months:  - given an extra £350m for councils to build more new houses and buy existing housing;  - given a £500m loan to Building Societies to keep mortgage rates down, and to make more mortgages available;  - introduced a rent freeze for both council and private tenants;  - passed a Rent Act to give security of tenure to furnished tenants of absentee landlords;  - legislated for the creation of Housing Action Areas and against the abuse of improvement grants;  - introduced a Bill to demolish the Tory Housing Finance Act.  The Labour Government will take into public ownership land required for development, redevelopment and improvement. These proposals do not apply to owner-occupiers, whose homes and gardens will be safeguarded. But the public ownership by local authorities of necessary land is essential to sensible and comprehensive planning both in our towns and in the countryside. The land will be paid for at existing use value and the expensive disgrace of land speculation will be ended.  The next Labour Government will:  - help home-buyers through a new National Housing Finance Agency to assist first-time buyers and to stabilise mortgage lending. Local councils' lending will be expanded so that they can play a major part in helping house purchasers and keep down costs by supplying unified services for estate agency, surveying, conveyancing and mortgages;  - restore to local authorities the right to fix rents which do not make profits out of their tenants;  - protect council tenants by giving them security of tenure;  - ensure that rent increases in the private sector will be limited by Government action and that houses without basic amenities will not be taken out of control;  - encourage the public ownership of rented property, except where an owner-occupier shares his home with a tenant;  - help conserve homes and areas that can be improved with the aid of grants rather than demolish them;  - reverse the disastrous fall in house-building, which will include measures to tackle the 'lump' and other proposals which must be worked out by both sides of the construction industry to attack the system of casual labour in the industry and create a stable, permanent work force;  - abolish the agricultural tied cottage system;  - transfer housing management and allocation to elected authorities in the New Towns nearing completion.  RATES  Everybody realises that the increasing responsibilities of local authorities must lead to reconsideration of the whole question of local government finance. The last Tory Government consistently rejected any alternatives to the rating system. And it bequeathed to Labour this year's massive rate rise. This record proves that their new proposals are vote-buying moonshine.  By contrast, the present Labour Government - like the last Labour Government - has taken swift action to help rate-payers. This year we are giving £150m of special help to those hardest hit by this year's rate increases, and rates have been kept down in hard-pressed inner city areas. And we have set up a high powered independent inquiry to try to find a workable alternative to the rating system as a matter of urgency.  We appreciate the anxieties of rate-payers and this is why we have set up this inquiry into local finance. But everybody has to face the fact that demands for better local services have to be paid for. And these have to be reconciled with demands for more local autonomy and less central direction. Public services have to be paid for by the public - the only argument is about how to share the costs, not how to avoid them.  ENVIRONMENT  Our home may be our most immediate environment. But our wider surroundings, whether at work or at leisure, demand much greater concern with the environment. We have published a Green Paper 'The Politics of Environment' which discusses many ideas about our changing world.  It was a Labour Government which in 1970 set up the permanent Royal Commission on the Environment and first appointed a Minister with overall responsibility for the environment. Within a few months the present Government put on the statute book the Control of Pollution Act. We scrapped the Maplin Airport project.  There is an increasing awareness of the need to treat the natural environment with more respect. The oil crisis was but one sharp reminder that finite natural resources cannot be taken for granted. We live in a wasteful society at a time of economic stringency. The Labour Government wants to reverse this trend and has already set up a Waste Management Advisory Council, appointed a responsible Minister, and published a Discussion Paper on the recycling of waste.  All our policies touch at some point or other on the living, working or recreational environment of our people. We will continue to work with the United Nations Council on Environment Problems, because these concern the whole world.  TRANSPORT  The energy crisis has underlined our objectives to move as much traffic as possible from road to rail and to water; and to develop public transport to make us less dependent upon the private car.  Labour's Railway Act 1974 provides for a general subsidy to passenger services and grants for the provision of new private sidings and .other freight facilities. Many proposed rail closures have been stopped.  Expenditure on new roads has been reviewed and priority given to the creation of a comprehensive heavy lorry network to divert the lorries now thundering through towns and villages. We shall continue to discourage the building of urban motorways.  Proposals have been issued to bring all commercial ports and cargo-handling into public ownership and control with a radical extension of worker participation in the industry.  Further measures will be introduced to:  - co-ordinate and integrate our transport services;  - improve public transport, especially in rural areas;  - extend public ownership of road haulage;  - expand the system of free and concessionary fares for old people, the blind and disabled;  - improve road safety.  SCOTLAND, WALES AND THE REGIONS  The next Labour Government will create elected assemblies in Scotland and Wales. It will also consult with the local authorities and other interested parties about the democratisation of those regional bodies which are at present non-accountable. A separate statement setting out more detailed proposals has already been published by the Labour Party and the Government's proposals are set out in the White Paper. Separate manifestos are being published for Scotland and Wales.  NORTHERN IRELAND  The Labour Party is working for a political solution in Northern Ireland, but no political initiative can succeed without the end of bombing and shooting in an area which has suffered over 1,000 dead and more than ten times as many injured.  Any political solution must enable Catholics and Protestants to work together. As a first step in our policy we have provided for the election of a Constitutional Convention to consider future government in Northern Ireland. It will be a Convention of Northern Irish people elected by Northern Irish people.  The Labour Government has spelt out certain realities which the Convention must take into account before it makes its report to Parliament at Westminster:  'There must be some form of power-sharing and partnership because no political system will survive, or be sup ported, unless there is widespread acceptance of it within the community. There must be genuine participation by both communities in the direction of affairs.  'Secondly, any pattern of government must be acceptable to the people of the United Kingdom as a whole and to Parliament at Westminster.  'Thirdly, Northern Ireland, unlike the rest of the United Kingdom, shares a common land frontier and a special relationship with another country, the Republic of Ireland. Any political arrangements must recognise and provide for this special relationship. There is an Irish dimension.'  When a Labour Government first sent troops into Northern Ireland it was on a temporary basis and their task was to stop sectarian violence. The Army cannot replace the police and it will be the aim of the Labour Government to encourage the whole community to support the police service which would enable the Army to make a planned, orderly and progressive reduction in its present commitment.  Britain has a responsibility in Northern Ireland and the Labour Party rejects the view that the troops should be pulled out in advance of a political solution. A sudden withdrawal in advance of any political settlement would leave a vacuum which would certainly be filled by para-military groups, with a grave possibility of civil war.  The Labour Government reaffirms its intention to phase out detention for all sections of the community in Northern Ireland when, but only when, the security situation permits. As an earnest of this intention, the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland has begun a programme of releases, in addition to those ordered by the Commissioners as part of the normal review procedure. More and more cases are being tried in the courts. Meanwhile, the Labour Government has established the Gardiner Committee to make a comprehensive review of the Northern Ireland (Emergency Provisions) Act 1974.  Our appeal is to all the people of Northern Ireland. It is our desire to harness the new awareness among many Catholics and Protestants of their social and economic interests and to enable them to fulfil their aspirations through political means. Labour's policy offers a new opportunity to achieve this.  INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS AND THE COMMUNITY  It is part of the very purpose of the Labour Party's existence to protect and extend the processes of democracy at all levels. It was a Labour Government which introduced the law which allows a citizen to sue Government itself; established the Parliamentary Commissioner; and legislated against racial discrimination and to enforce equal pay. Now we want to give a much bigger say to citizens in all their various capacities - as tenants, shoppers, patients, voters. Or as residents or workers in areas where development proposals make them feel more planned against than planned for.  Labour believes that respect for the law must be firmly based on the rights of the citizen and on his or her obligations to the whole community. We share the view of those who are alarmed at the growth of violence in our society, particularly among young people. Labour believes that law-abiding citizens are entitled to full protection. We will strengthen and uphold the police in the exercise of their proper functions. We reject entirely the view that law enforcement should ever be a matter for self appointed and politically motivated private armies.  Labour respects the rule of law; it does not respect those who want to be unofficial enforcement officers or their own special version of it. We shall also vigorously pursue policies for the elimination of areas of deprivation which are the most dangerous breeding grounds of juvenile and other crime. A Labour Government set up the Law Commission machinery to overhaul the whole body of our laws, some of which are out of date and irrelevant. In the interests of a wider, more just and effective democracy we shall seek to:  - give real equality to women;  - strengthen legislation protecting minorities;  - reform the law of nationality and citizenship;  - introduce an independent element into complaints against the police;  - make legal advice more accessible to those most in need of help;  - extend legal aid to certain tribunal hearings;  - encourage local authorities in a diversity of neighbourhood or community consultation;  - work with the co-operative movement to develop its role through the creation of a Co-operative Development Agency and in other ways.  Labour believes that the process of government should be more open to the public. We shall:  - replace the Official Secrets Act by a measure to put the burden on the public authorities to justify withholding information;  - establish compulsory registers of interest for all MPs, councillors, peers, senior civil servants, senior council officials, and others in the upper reaches of the public service;  - protect the citizen from unwarranted and mischievous intrusion into the citizen's private affairs.  A CHARTER FOR WOMEN  Changes in our society over recent years have emphasised the importance of providing practical equal opportunities for women rather than making polite noises about equality. We have already made a start towards equal citizenship by giving British women, married to foreign husbands, the same rights as British men with foreign wives.  The Labour Government's decisions provide a new deal for women. We will:  - ensure that by the end of 1975 Labour's Equal Pay Act will be fully effective throughout the land;  - introduce a comprehensive free family planning service;  - legislate for equality of treatment in social security;  - make provision for maternity leave;  - introduce a new child cash allowance to be paid (including the first child) usually to mothers;  - extend nursery education and day care facilities;  - bring a fairer system of family law with new family courts;  - reform housing law, to strengthen the rights of mothers on the break-up of marriage: and introduce other reforms proposed by the Finer Committee on One Parent Families;  - increase educational opportunities for girls, including further education, training and compulsory day release.  We also intend to legislate directly on new rights for women, through a Sex Discrimination Bill as set out in our White Paper. The proposals cover: employment, training, education, housing and the provision of goods, facilities and services (including mortgages and H.P., etc.) There will also be new machinery to ensure the enforcement of these measures.  But of course all our proposals - about prices and consumer protection and homes and education and full employment - will help to improve life for all the women of our country.  And we are determined to see more of them from all walks of life - in Parliament, on local councils and other public bodies - including political parties and trade union committees.  THE COMMON MARKET  Our genuine concern for democratic rights is in sharp contrast to the Tory attitude. In the greatest single peacetime decision of this century - Britain's membership of the Common Market - the British people were not given a chance to say whether or not they agreed to the terms accepted by the Tory Government. Both the Conservatives and the Liberals have refused to endorse the rights of our people to make their own decision. Only the Labour Party is committed to the right of the men and women of this country to make this unique decision.  The Labour Government pledges that within twelve months of this election we will give the British people the final say, which will be binding on the Government - through the ballot box - on whether we accept the terms and stay in or reject the terms and come out.  Labour is an internationalist party and Britain is a European nation. But if the Common Market were to mean the creation of a new protectionist bloc, or if British membership threatened to impoverish our working people or to destroy the authority of Parliament, then Labour could not agree.  Within one month of coming into office the Labour Government started the negotiations promised in our February manifesto on the basis set out in that manifesto. It is as yet too early to judge the likely results of the tough negotiations which are taking place. But whatever the outcome in Brussels, the decision will be taken here by the British people.  POLICY FOR PEACE - INTERNATIONAL CO-OPERATION AND SECURITY  The nations of the world are becoming ever more economically and politically interdependent. The energy crisis of last winter could not be solved by any individual country acting on its own - international co-operation was required. The same is true if the world is to succeed in solving the problems of inflation, of poverty, of economic growth and full employment. We are more than ever one world. Labour's foreign policy is, therefore, dedicated to strengthening international institutions and to world co-operation in all fields, including trade and currency.  A Labour Government which excluded from its foreign policy the ideals of morality, equality and justice, which are at the heart of our domestic policy, would soon lose such ideals at home. The Labour Government will, therefore, continue its policy of strengthening international organisations and particularly the United Nations, dedicated to the peaceful settlement of disputes, to the promotion of human rights, to the rule of law and to the improvement of living standards throughout the world.  We shall continue to work for a peaceful and just settlement of the disputes in the Middle East and in Cyprus in the light of the declarations of the United Nations and our own responsibilities.  The Labour Government has placed great emphasis on the need for closer relations with Commonwealth countries and we shall use every means of strengthening our ties with them. The Government has accepted the United Nations target of 0.7% of the Gross National Product for financial aid to developing countries in need throughout the world and will seek to move towards it as fast as possible. We have provided special help for the developing countries hardest hit by the crisis in oil prices and for areas of famine and disaster, and we have set up a Disaster Unit to speed our response to emergencies. We shall direct our aid towards the poorest countries and to the poorest people and give emphasis to rural development. In recent negotiations between the European Economic Community and the African, Pacific and Caribbean countries we have sought, with some success, to establish a more generous and liberal trading pattern to meet their needs.  We oppose all forms of racial discrimination and colonialism. We will continue to support the liberation movements of Southern Africa. By a decision of the Government arms are no longer being supplied to South Africa. The Labour Government will seek to end the unlawful South African occupation of Namibia. The policy of sanctions against Rhodesia has been intensified and we will agree to no settlement which does not have the agreement of the African people of that country.  The policy of détente between East and West has brought a relaxation of tension in Europe as in other parts of the world. It is the objective of the Labour Government to bring the current negotiations in the Geneva Conference on European Security and Co-operation to a successful conclusion.  The Labour Government is conducting the widest ranging defence review to be carried out in peacetime; and we shall, in consultation with our Allies, press forward with our plans to reduce the proportion of the nation's resources devoted to defence so that the burden we bear will be brought into line with that carried by our main European allies. Such a realignment would, at present levels of defence spending, mean achieving annual savings over a period on defence expenditure by Britain of several hundred million pounds. If in time this entails closure of or cutting back on defence establishments, alternative sources of employment will be sought, where possible by taking on major contract work and research for outside industry.  Starting from the basis of the multilateral disarmament negotiations, we will seek the removal of American Polaris bases from Britain. We have renounced any intention of moving towards a new generation of strategic nuclear weapons.  The Labour Government will maintain its support for NATO as an instrument of détente, no less than of defence. The ultimate objective of the movement towards a satisfactory relationship in Europe must be the mutual and concurrent phasing out of both NATO and the Warsaw Pact. The Government will continue to work for the success of détente by playing an active role in the multilateral disarmament negotiations now taking place in Vienna and will back this diplomacy by improving bilateral relations with the USSR and the countries of Eastern Europe up to the limit that the situation in each case allows.  We shall continue to improve relations between Britain and China.  TIME FOR DECISION  We have not tried in this manifesto to pretend that there is some simple, easy way out of the crisis which confronts us. But we have tried to set out the kind of programme needed to unite the nation against the dangers ahead; a programme designed to create a fairer, more democratic and more socially just society.  We have made no easy promises. Our programme has been fully costed. And we have weighed those costs carefully. But we have set our aims high. We are a democratic socialist party and our objective is to bring about a fundamental and irreversible shift in the balance of wealth and power in favour of working people and their families. Now it is for the voters of our nation to make their decision. The Government is pledged to the service of the nation. But only the nation, working with the right leadership, can solve its problems. We believe it will. Britain will win with Labour. "
NA,197410,"Why Britain Needs Liberal Government  A PERSONAL MESSAGE FROM  THE RT. HON. JEREMY THORPE  ""This election will make or break Britain. It is already certain that the Government which takes office after the election will face the greatest peace-time crisis we have known since the dark days of 1931.  The fact that we are committed to two elections in one year highlights the uncertainties and divisions of British politics. Mr. Heath called the first election back in February because his industrial and economic strategy had totally collapsed and he had no alternative. He lost, and relations between the Conservative Party and the Trade Union Movement will take many years to restore.  Mr. Wilson has called the second election because he is not prepared to accept the disciplines of a minority Government. So long as a minority Government governs on behalf of the whole nation it can command a majority in Parliament. At the last election, the electorate clearly refused to give him a mandate for those divisive parts of his programme such as further nationalisation and clearly in calling for an election he has shown he is not prepared to accept that verdict.  Liberals are unashamedly committed to breaking the two Party system in which the Party of Management alternates with the Party of Trade Unionism, each committed to the reversal of their predecessors' policies. Both interest groups represent vital elements in our society. Neither should ever be allowed to dominate the thinking of the government of the day. Instant reversal has brought uncertainty over Europe, over pensions, in the future of industry and has undermined confidence and stability.  As the leader of a national political party it is my duty to warn the nation of the consequences if we fail to overcome this crisis. It is also my duty clearly and firmly to point the way out of our desperate situation.  The first priority must be to promote a sense of common endeavour and national purpose in government. We must persuade all people to lay aside the differences which divide and weaken us as a nation and to unite in pursuit. of a solution to our difficulties. We must persuade ourselves that the survival of Britain is far more important than the advancement of any single individual or party and that we have far more in common as British citizens than the artificial divisions which society inflicts on us.  But this unity will not be enough unless we can also isolate and deal with the fundamental defects - economic, political and social - which have led us to the brink of disaster. The next Government will have, without prejudice or precondition, to set itself to reconstruct Britain on a much fairer basis. It will have to attack poverty at source, redistribute wealth and income so that the rewards of endeavour correspond more closely to the value of the effort involved. It will have to remove the class divisions inherent in our society, particularly in our industrial relations and in the way we allocate national resources between rich and poor.  I do not claim that it can be done overnight but I do say that unless a start is made-and very soon-the new endeavour, which is needed to rescue us, will not be forthcoming.  Now is the time to decide whether we are to continue the steady decline in our national life, or whether we are going to pull ourselves back from the brink. Only with the necessary political will coupled with the concerted efforts of us all can we rescue ourselves. In asking for your commitment to the Liberal cause at this election. I am inviting you to join 6 million voters who support a party untainted by failure in government and unprejudiced by vested interests The Liberal Party can attract the support of all people drawn from every spectrum of our society who want to see a fair and tolerant society in Britain. With 6 million voters on which to build, and 600 candidates in the field, the opportunities open to us are unlimited.  The sort of policies which we are putting forward are fair-they are realistic-they are tough. I claim that they represent a programme which can unite Britain and can achieve the success which as a nation we have so long been denied.  Our greatest asset is that we could become the first post war Government which owed nothing to any sectional group or interest. In the February election, 2 million traditional Liberals were joined by 2 million previous Tory and 2 million previous  Labour voters giving us a total of 6 million votes. It only needs to do this again, and we have united the centre in British politics.  In short, l believe that Liberals can become the catalyst to bind the country together in a new spirit of common endeavour and I ask for your support in this great undertaking.""  Britain in Danger  This country faces two immediate crises. The first is potential economic catastrophe caused partly by world events and partly because of our own stagnating economy. The second is a crisis of national disunity in which there is a distinct lack of faith in government at the very time when it is most needed.  Unless the next Government deals immediately with these problems any long term aims for the future will be quite unattainable. This Manifesto unashamedly concentrates on the immediate situation and outlines policies to deal with it. We have deliberately refrained from restating our full programme of policies which were set out in last February's Manifesto 'Change the face of Britain' and in the document 'Forward with the Liberals'. Nevertheless they are an integral part of Liberal thinking and our aims and principles remain valid.  The basic principle of Liberalism is a concern for the individual. We do not think in terms of bosses or masses or classes. We start with the individual men and women who make up these vast conglomerations of people.  The great issue facing all nations in this century is how to combine the collective activity of the state, necessary for the welfare of the people with democratic freedoms and an opportunity for individual initiative in economic enterprise. The Liberal Party's great claim is that it approaches this problem with no doctrinaire prejudices, no class inhibitions and no sectional interests.  We seek to redistribute so that all may own and so that none may be impoverished. We seek to create an individual partnership between capital and labour. We seek to devolve power to Scotland, Wales and the regions of England. We seek to decentralise by ensuring that every act of government is carried out at the lowest level consistent with intelligent administration.  Through participation we want to see ordinary men and women having a say in all that goes on around them. And just as we seek to break down concentrations of political power, we seek in the same way to break down monopolistic concentrations of economic power.  In the world sphere we are essentially internationalist. We oppose narrow, self-interested policies by nations or power blocs. We welcome the opportunity to transform the European Economic Community into a Liberal, outward looking federation of free people with sovereignty, pooled in respect of vital political and economic tasks, but with equally clearly defined powers and responsibilities for the constituent states and regions.  All these themes have one end. To serve the individual and to create the conditions in which he can develop his personality to the full. But these aims are endangered by the immediate problems which we now face.  Unless the British people unite to overcome our common difficulties our future prosperity as a democracy will be in grave jeopardy. The remainder of this Manifesto examines the immediate crisis and outlines the Liberal solution.  THE ECONOMIC CRISIS This Election is being fought against the threat of economic disaster, caused by stagnation and high inflation. The rapid upsurge in world commodity prices has resulted in balance of payments deficits for almost the entire Western World.  Britain has been particularly hard hit. Our cost of living soared by 16 per cent. in 1973 alone and is currently rising at the rate of 20 per cent. a year, which means that our money will buy only four-fifths of what it could buy a year ago.  Unemployment is again increasing rapidly. Thousands of people are losing their jobs every month-35,OO0 in August alone. If present trends continue, three-quarters of a million people could be out of work by the end of this year.  We are borrowing astronomical sums of money abroad. This year alone, our balance of payments is in deficit by £4,500 million. Our share of world trade is steadily declining and no amount of North Sea Oil, or any other panacea, will repay these debts in the foreseeable future.  IN SHORT, WE ARE LIVING BEYOND OUR MEANS AND THIS UNPALATABLE TRUTH MUST HE COMMUNICATED TO THE PEOPLE, WHATEVER THE POLITICAL CONSEQUENCES. As Jeremy Thorpe has said: 'It is time for Britain to wake up and realise that only a total change of course in our politics, our economy and our national aspirations can save us from disaster'.  THE POLITICAL CRISIS Before any Government can begin to get to grips with the economic situation, it must regain the confidence and respect of the electorate.  Our present electoral system is a fraud. Far from ensuring representative government, it polarises power between two extremist parties representing opposed classes and prevents a proper representation of alternative view-points. At every Election less than half the voters get the candidate of their choice returned to Parliament.  Many people are frustrated by the lack of success which is apparent, regardless of the party in office. The prospects for success are continually undermined by the fact that, once a party becomes the Government it feels obliged to cancel much of what its opponents had previously done in office. Time and time again it is ultimately obliged by events to readopt these policies. This constant vacillation causes the most devastating uncertainty in our political and economic life.  The class war produces deep and irreconcilable differences between the Conservative and Labour Parties, but these differences stem, not from a substantial issue of principle, but from preconceived dogma which has no relevance today. Class-based parties, above all, are responsible for the partisan nature of British politics and the divisions in society between rich and poor, manager and worker, householder and tenant.  It is impossible to conceive of a Labour Party dependent on the trade unions for 90 per cent. of its funds being able to operate an effective incomes policy, when its paymasters, the union leaders, object to wage control.  Conversely, how can a Conservative Government take effective action to control prices and stamp out restrictive practices in industry when it is dependent on big business for over a million pounds a year?  Yet these are precisely the policies we need at the moment if we are to overcome inflation.  Nor will any policy achieve lasting progress without the consent of a large majority of the population. Since the war, neither of the other two parties has won the support of more than half of the electorate. Neither can achieve the necessary degree of unity because each is incapable of appealing to any significant number of the other's traditional supporters. A Labour Government instinctively raises the suspicions of business; a Conservative Government immediately alienates the Trade Unions.  THE TIME HAS COME FOR STABILITY IN GOVERNMENT AND AN END TO CLASS CONFRONTATION BASED ON FEAR AND MISTRUST. This country can no longer be ruled from the extremes of right and left, setting people against each other; it must be run by a Government whose integrity is not in doubt, whose policies are fair minded and whose politics are not governed by vested interests. It is the unique characteristic of the Liberal Party that it can provide such a Government because it is without doctrinaire prejudices, class inhibitions or sectional interests.  Inflation - The immediate crisis  The major single problem facing the next Government will be that of inflation. This Election wilt solve nothing unless we decide now that we are to make a conscious and concentrated effort to get on top of inflation. On the contrary, it will do positive harm if, as has happened so often in the past, the nation is left bitterly divided as a result.  THE NEXT GOVERNMENT MUST HE HONEST WITH THE PUBLIC AND ADMIT THAT IN THE PRESENT CIRCUMSTANCES A STATUTORY PRICES AND INCOMES POLICY IS ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY AS AN ESSENTIAL WEAPON AGAINST INFLATION.  The Liberal Party has consistently advocated statutory controls; the other parties have studiously avoided them until forced into action by an adverse situation. When they have taken action both have pandered to vested interests to the detriment of the population as a whole. They have been fearful of embarking on long-term policies to control inflation for fear of denting the profits of the big corporations or the wage packets of the strongest unions. Their timid attempts at controlling inflation have been undercut by promises of an ultimate return to a free-for-all. As a result, their policies have failed because the nation was unprepared for such measures and the necessary restraint was not forthcoming.  No policy will gain acceptance unless it is seen to be both effective in its operation and fair to all concerned. Inflation divides society; it punishes and deprives the weak and protects and rewards the strong. It encourages a situation where the rich get more and the poor go to the wall, where wealth is illusory but poverty is real. Therefore, it is dangerous to attack inflation without at the same time protecting those who are most vulnerable to its effects.  The Liberal Party believes that this can only be done by means of a fundamental redistribution of wealth and resources. We understand the fear of inflation that motivates moderate-and not so moderate-men to press for higher and higher wages. We are prepared to resist these claims when we feel they are unjustified and against the national interest. But we also recognise that even the most efficient policy will be breached unless the causes of inequality are removed.  WE, THEREFORE, ADVOCATE, AS AN ESSENTIAL PREREQUISITE TO THE INTRODUCTION OF STATUTORY PRICES AND INCOMES CONTROL, A PROGRAMME OF SOCIAL REFORM.  In effect, this would be an agreement between the people of this country and the Government of the day. In return for immediate measures to alleviate poverty and industrial uncertainty and unrest, the next Government could count on positive acceptance for a measure of restraint. Such a programme should contain four minimum proposals:  First, a policy for creating and redistributing national wealth.  Second, measures to encourage true competition and power-sharing in industry.  Third, a review of our public expenditure programme with priority being given to maintaining and expanding social welfare provision.  Fourth, the reform of our electoral and governmental structures to reflect more accurately the will of the electorate.  CREATING AND SHARING WEALTH Our primary task in the immediate aftermath of the Election will be to establish an agreed attitude towards managing the economy. This must include a statutory policy for prices and incomes, which will only allow personal wealth to expand at a rate which the nation can afford. At the same time it must effect a redistribution of incomes and a far greater degree of social justice. The present grossly inequitable distribution of incomes is starkly illustrated by the plight of those engaged in the health, social and public services, many of whom are women. THE NEXT GOVERNMENT SHOULD LEGISLATE IMMEDIATELY TO INTRODUCE A STATUTORY MINIMUM EARNINGS LEVEL, CORRESPONDING TO TWO-THIRDS OF THE AVERAGE WAGE, FOR A NORMAL 40-HOUR WORKING WEEK. This would mean guaranteed earnings of £27, at current rates, for the 44 million working people who earn less than this amount, the figure automatically increasing with rises in average earnings. If phased in over a three year period it would add 3 per cent. per annum to the national wage bill, and would necessitate a corresponding cut-back in the expectation of above-average wage earners. Such people will have to be content with pay increases which cover only rises in the cost of living.  At the same time the Government should undertake to implement in full the principle of parity with equivalent jobs in the private sector for those working in the nationalised industries and public services.  A SIMILAR SELECTIVE POLICY FOR PRICES MUST HE EVOLVED TO PROTECT THE FAMILY FROM EXCESSIVE PRICE INCREASES AT A TIME OF WAGE RESTRAINT. The present supervision of prices, dividends and profit margins should be continued and middle-sized companies should be obliged to submit applications for price increases in the same way as top companies. More positive efforts must be made to break up monopolies and price fixing and to recreate a genuinely competitive economy. The Monopoly and Mergers Commission should be given powers to investigate and regulate monopoly companies. The Government should stimulate competition where it can still be made to work, break up and control monopolies, prevent non-productive mergers and stamp out restrictive trade practices, so that profits are made fairly, in truly competitive circumstances.  INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENT Our immediate aim is to restore confidence and stability in industry, to encourage an even flow of investment and to distribute wealth more widely. Policies for nationalisation are irrelevant to the problems of industry. As the Court Line disaster has shown, the merest hint of nationalisation is sufficient to drive away private investment, leaving the long-suffering general public to foot the bill. There is a role for private and public enterprise but a clear line of demarcation should be drawn between them. And both must change their mode of operation if confidence and stability in industry is to return.  A NATIONAL PROGRAMME FOR INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENT OUGHT THEREFORE TO CONTAIN FOUR BASIC OBJECTIVES, NAMELY: THE REFORM OF COMPANY LAW TO INDUCE A FAR GREATER DEGREE OF PUBLIC RESPONSIBILITY IN INDUSTRY AND MAKE THE MANAGEMENT OF COMPANIES RESPONSIBLE TO SHAREHOLDERS AND EMPLOYEES ON AN EQUAL BASIS. Then there must be a concentrated attack on monopolies on the lines of the American anti-trust laws. Nationalisation will not solve the problems of high prices or monopolies. As we have seen in so many nationalised industries, the public either has to suffer high prices or subsidise non-profit making industries. Either way the consumer pays more.  Next, the Government should consult with industry to establish the prospects for investment. Where the economic advantages to the nation would be enhanced by investment in certain industries, the Government should also be prepared to underwrite the necessary finance for a limited period of time, if necessary. An essential prerequisite to this policy must be a commitment by Government to refrain from further nationalisation except where there is no other viable alternative, and liquidation would be detrimental to the nation, as, for example, in the case of Rolls-Royce.  Finally, a phased introduction of worker-participation and co-partnership schemes at all levels of industry from the shop-floor upwards, should involve union and non-union workers in the exercise of power. We would require legislation to set up works councils in all industries above a certain size and to establish the principle of worker representation at board level. The introduction of approved profit-sharing schemes (or, in the case of the nationalised industries, a dividend for each industry, based on productivity) is also essential if the necessary co-operation is to be achieved at plant level.  The key to a successful programme of industrial development lies in a continuous flow of investment capital, a stable and contented work force and a steady increase in output. These must be our objectives.  PUBLIC EXPENDITURE AND FAMILY NEEDS The most vital provisions any Government can make for its people are to ensure that they have a decent roof over their heads and an adequate income. In the immediate period of low or non-existent economic growth, we cannot assume that our expenditure on these programmes will be paid for by greater production and economic expansion. Therefore we must find the money from other sources. We must now learn to live within our means. Strict economies in non-essential expenditure must now be made if our public services are even to be maintained at their current standards, let alone expanded.  The indexation of savings against inflation would protect those dependent on their savings and encourage greater investment. This should be accompanied by a far greater degree of austerity and care in the deployment of public money.  AT LOCAL LEVEL THERE MUST HE A RADICAL OVERHAUL OF THE RATING SYSTEM AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE, SO AS TO REDISTRIBUTE THE BURDEN FAIRLY BETWEEN RATEPAYERS AND TO RAISE THE FINANCE NECESSARY TO ENSURE THE CONTINUATION OF ESSENTIAL SERVICES. Liberals would introduce site value rating to replace the current rating of property by a rate geared to the value of the land on which the building stands. This would redistribute the burden of rates more fairly between domestic and industrial rate payers.  To reduce the burden on local authority expenditure, teachers' salaries should be paid through the Exchequer, thereby saving local authorities £570 million a year. Local authorities should also be given limited scope for raising revenue independently through appropriate local taxes.  Our priorities in the field of social welfare must be twofold; to reform and expand the provision of family welfare and to stabilise the chaotic system of housing finance. In general, the aim must be to recast existing programmes as far as possible rather than incurring further expenditure. In the case of the National Health Service, however, only a massive injection of capital can save it from imminent collapse and this will have to be done almost immediately.  The other major exception to this rule must be old age pensioners. In spite of the recent increase, the basic State pension is still pitifully inadequate, and over two million pensioners are forced to draw Supplementary Benefit in order to exist. The next Government should give an immediate commitment to tie the pension to a stated percentage of national average earnings. This would provide an automatic index against inflation and ensure that pensioners are not left behind in the wage race. The target to be met, over a three-year period, ought to be 50 per cent. of average earnings for a married couple and a third for a single person. At present wage rates this would work out at £21 and £14 respectively. The total cost would be £1,400 million, which can be raised by transforming the present contributory National Insurance system into a fully graduated Social Security Tax. This would be paid by employer and employee on a ratio of two-thirds to one-third, and would be much fairer on the low paid and self-employed. At present they pay a higher percentage of their earnings in National Insurance contributions than the above average wage earner. In addition Liberals will take the initiative in seeking all-party agreement on the creation of a second pension structure for all those in full-time employment. This would end the uncertainty and instability in the Occupational Pensions field caused by the changes in policy of successive governments.  In the field of housing, we must accept that we cannot continue indefinitely to subsidise the Building Societies in a vain attempt to keep interest rates down. If subsidies are necessary, they should be paid to individuals on the basis of need. In the short-term, our immediate priority should be to enable those who wish to buy their homes to overcome the twin barriers of inflated house prices and high interest rates. In ten years the price of an average new house has risen three times, the cost of a mortgage has risen five times whilst the proportion of an average family's income spent on mortgage repayments has increased from 25 per cent. to 50 per cent. THE AVERAGE PRICE OF A NEW HOUSE AT OVER £10,900 IS WELL BEYOND THE REACH OF OVER HALF THE POPULATION AND UNLESS STEPS ARE TAKEN SOON TO ALLEVIATE THE SITUATION, HOME OWNERSHIP WILL BECOME A THING OF THE PAST.  This problem can be overcome without any extra governmental expenditure by the introduction of flexible mortgage schemes for all those buying their own home.  The Liberal proposals were discussed with the Building Societies prior to being incorporated in a recent pamphlet, and provide for three new schemes:  For those whose earnings are linked to the cost of living, through, for example, threshold agreements, an index linked mortgage would be appropriate. Under this scheme repayments begin at a lower initial value but rise automatically with increases in the cost of living index.  For those who are near retirement and wish to buy their first, and probably their last, home, the equity mortgage scheme would enable them to do so. Here the Building Society would buy a share of the house by contributing an interest-free grant, thus reducing the cost of the mortgage, in return for a share of the capital value when the house is sold. These schemes have already been discussed with representatives of the Building Societies and there is no practical reason why an enterprising Government could not introduce them immediately.  We must make far better use of existing accommodation. Wherever possible local authorities should purchase unsold properties for use as council houses, rather than leaving them to lie empty. If builders could be sure of selling their houses, there would be much greater incentive to press ahead with new contracts. Our proposals would achieve this at minimal cost to the Government.  In making adequate provision for low income families the next Government ought to take steps to ensure that financial aid goes to those in need and is not wasted. This can be achieved in two ways. Firstly, the wasteful and indiscriminate food subsidies should be scrapped and the £700 million thus saved spent on increasing family allowances and extending them to the first child. This would cost £340 million in a full year and would be far more effective than reducing the millionaire's loaf of bread by 2p. The remainder of the money saved could be put towards implementing the Finer Committee's recommendation, that an adequate allowance should be available to single parents with families to support, and assisting the disabled and other needy people.  Secondly, the first steps should be taken towards overhauling the entire Social Security system, eliminating most of the 44 means tests and replacing the unnecessary duplication between the Inland Revenue and the Department of Health and Social Security. Liberals would introduce a full scale tax-credit scheme which would encompass all existing allowances and welfare benefits. It would also replace all tax reliefs on mortgages, rent allowances and rent rebates by a single housing allowance paid to tenants and house buyers alike. The essence of the scheme is simple and was set out in our Manifesto last February. A GOVERNMENT COMMITMENT TO PHASE IN SUCH A SCHEME OVER A FIVE-YEAR PERIOD IS ESSENTIAL IF THE NECESSARY AGREEMENT FROM THOSE ON LOW PAY FOR A STATUTORY PRICES AND INCOMES POLICY IS TO EMERGE.  Implicit in all our objectives in the field of social policy is a commitment to ensure full and equal rights for women in every sphere. Liberals were the first to initiate legislation against sex-discrimination and there will be no let up in our campaign for equality between the sexes.  CONTROLLING INFLATION Once a minimum programme of social reform is agreed, we believe that any Government has the moral authority to ask the nation to exercise restraint in its economic aspirations in order to control inflation. But experience has shown that voluntary restraint is inadequate; there are always those who will break the rules either through force of habit or because they have the economic power to get what they want. Therefore, a statutory policy with tough sanctions on those who break it is essential. Liberals would control inflation through a combination of industrial reconstruction and a prices and incomes policy enforced by penalties on those whose actions cause inflation. We propose that prices and average earnings within a company should be limited to an agreed annual rate of increase. Any company which increased prices faster than that rate would suffer an extra surcharge on its Corporation Tax payments equivalent to the amount by which its prices had exceeded the agreed norm.  If average earnings per person (including fringe benefits) within a company rose faster than the agreed annual rate, then both the employer and the employees concerned would have to pay an extra surcharge on their graduated National Insurance Contributions, again on a sliding scale according to the amount by which earnings had exceeded the norm.  Of course, there must be provision for appeal if confrontation with those who have a special case is to be avoided. This would be best achieved by the compilation of ad hoc reports on earnings levels and pricing policies in particular industries, along the lines of the old National Board for Prices and Incomes. Such reports would also cover changes in relativities and wage differentials, which will have to be narrowed considerably, and Parliamentary consent would have to be obtained before reports could be implemented. The Relativities Board would be retained for this purpose. Thus instead of countering inflation by increasing everybody's taxes, as Mr. Powell and the Labour Party advocate, our policy would tax only those who cause inflation and control the supply of money into the economy without having to resort to the blunt instrument of brutal cuts in expenditure on social services which, once again, hit the poor hardest of all.  A great merit of this policy is that it would enable wage bargaining to take place without direct government intervention and inevitable accusations of partisanship. Yet it would still enable the Government to maintain overall control of the economy.  THE NEXT GOVERNMENT MUST FACE UP TO THE PROBLEM OF DOMESTIC INFLATION IMMEDIATELY ON ASSUMING OFFICE IF WE ARE TO AVOID THE PERILS OF BANKRUPTCY, POVERTY AND UNEMPLOYMENT. WE BELIEVE THAT THIS PROGRAMME IS THE MINIMUM THAT WILL GENERATE THE NECESSARY CONSENT FOR A TOUGH ANTI-INFLATION POLICY.  THE NEED FOR AGRICULTURAL EXPANSION As long as our agriculture industry is allowed to decline we shall become increasingly dependent on the vicissitudes of the world market. Therefore we must become more self sufficient through greater domestic food production.  Farmers have had a raw deal recently and badly need an injection of confidence. The next government should undertake to introduce a temporary guaranteed price for beef and an increase in the milk subsidy. The pig subsidy should also be extended through the winter.  The Government should also seek a radical change in the Common Agriculture Policy of the Common Market in order to secure a reasonable return for the farmer and more stable prices for the consumer. THIS CAN ONLY HE DONE FROM WITHIN THE COMMUNITY BY A GOVERNMENT COMMITTED TO OUR CONTINUED MEMBERSHIP. WORLD FOOD PRICES NOW EXCEED THOSE PERTAINING IN EUROPE AND IT WOULD HE TOTALLY AGAINST OUR ECONOMIC INTERESTS TO WITHDRAW, REGARDLESS OF THE POLITICAL CONSIDERATIONS INVOLVED.  There remains the political crisis; this must also be faced now if our democracy is to survive and our government to is regain the confidence of the electorate.  Power to the people  The two-party system began to crumble at the last Election. Alienation and cynicism with conventional politics is particularly felt in Scotland and Wales where the Westminster Parliament is a distant and inadequate form of representation.  Two major reforms must be introduced by the next Government. First it must replace the present antiquated electoral system, in which 19 million people have no influence on the choice of government. Liberals favour a fully proportional system using the single transferable vote in multi-member constituencies. Second, there must be a substantial devolution of power from Westminster, initially to Parliaments in Scotland and Wales, along the lines advocated by the Kilbrandon Commission on the Constitution. These Parliaments should have substantial legislative and budgetary powers-nothing less will satisfy the aspirations of the people of Scotland and Wales for full self-government, which Liberals support. Ultimately, Liberals want a Federal system of Government in Britain with Assemblies established in the regions of England.  UNLESS THESE REFORMS ARE CARRIED OUT VERY SOON THE PROCESS OF ALIENATION FROM GOVERNMENT WILL BECOME SO DEEP SEATED AS TO HE BEYOND REDRESS.  A similar feeling of antipathy will soon be felt towards the European Communities unless there are direct elections to the European Parliament. This has been part of Liberal policy for a very long time and a government led initiative would help restore confidence in the European idea as well as being an indication of continued faith in our membership of the Community.  The above measures constitute the minimum social, economic and political programme which can save this country from the immediate crisis. WE CANNOT AFFORD ANOTHER FIVE YEAR PERIOD IN WHICH MAJOR PROBLEMS ARE SWEPT UNDER THE CARPET WHILE POLITICIANS PRETEND THAT INFLATION DOES NOT EXIST. The next Government must be prepared to implement substantial radical changes in policy which will lay the groundwork for future economic prosperity. In doing so it must have regard for the long term, as well as the immediate, future. For only if we build on the foundations laid will we reap the rewards that economic self-restraint can produce.  The Liberal Challenge  The Liberal Party challenges the people of this country at this Election to break away from the class-based politics of the past in favour of a party without vested interests to consider, which is free to act on behalf of the individual person. Politics should be about people in their own communities but, in spite of so many elections in recent years, ordinary people feel that government is too distant and no longer heeds what they say. The re-organisation of Local Government and the restructuring of our health and social services has resulted in larger, more distant units of administration. The Liberal Party believes in self-government at every level, so that ordinary people can take and use power to influence their daily lives. All our policies, from the reform of government, and co-partnership in industry, to democracy in education, are designed to ensure that the individual viewpoint can be expressed effectively. WITHOUT THE ACTIVE PARTICIPATION OF THE GREAT MAJORITY OF PEOPLE, OUR ABILITY TO OVERCOME THE ECONOMIC PROBLEMS WHICH WE FACE WILL HE GREATLY IMPAIRED.  Only a new political alignment can provide the momentum for economic stability. At the last Election, 6 million people supported the Liberal Party as the vehicle for this new momentum. Many others stood on the brink but their traditional allegiances and the understandable fear of breaking with the past prevented them from committing themselves fully. Yet the seeds have been sown, and after the election a strong Liberal Party in Parliament could break up the confrontation of the two class parties and create the conditions for a broad based radical alliance led by Liberals. Over 47 per cent. of the electorate would like to see a Liberal Government. If this support is translated into votes there will be a Liberal Government. "
"Conservatives",197410,"Putting Britain First  A national policy  The dangers now facing Britain are greater than any we have seen since the last war. These dangers are both economic and political.  Over recent months prices have been rising at an annual rate of over 20 per cent, and on present policies they will rise as much next year. This means that in two years the pound will be worth only 55p. Unemployment is rising rapidly, and the deficit in our balance of payments this year will be £4,000 million. By the end of the 1970s, on present forecasts, we are likely to owe £15,000 million for oil alone.  At the same time the rule of law is threatened, and there are conflicts within the nation.  If we do not solve our economic problems, our political difficulties will be made worse. And if we do not tackle our political problems, our economic problems will be insoluble.  Our main aim therefore is to safeguard the existence of our free society.  For inflation at its present pace threatens not only the standard of living of everybody in the country, but also the survival of our free and democratic institutions. No major democracy has ever survived such a catastrophic rise in the cost of living. We cannot be sure that we would be the exception.  In any case inflation and rising prices tear society apart.. They destroy the confidence of people in one another and the future; they distort the existing relationships within our country; they poison the social environment; they wipe out people's savings; they imperil our economic system; they lead in the end to high unemployment and to widespread, if not national, bankruptcy; and they bring particular hardship and misery to the most vulnerable people in the land.  And that is not all. Another consequence of inflation is that financial manipulations often provide much greater scope for gain than solid hard work. This in itself breeds disillusionment and frustration. Lack of confidence in the currency leads to lessening respect for the law: hence sectional groups are starting to take the law into their own hands and to pursue their ends with a ruthless disregard for the interests of others.  Finally, inflation weakens international confidence in sterling and intensifies the balance of payments crisis. In a few years time North Sea oil should give us an advantage over many of our competitors. But if we rely too much on borrowing from abroad to finance our payments deficit, our gains from North Sea oil will be mortgaged for many years ahead, and our hopes for prosperity based upon that oil will be dashed.  Inflation is therefore a moral and political evil as well as a social and economic evil. Everything else is secondary to the battle against inflation and to helping those who have been wounded in it.  There is no quick or simple way of defeating inflation. We do not claim to have any easy solution. Indeed no government can beat inflation by itself.  The only way the battle can be won is by the Government and the people of this country uniting on a national policy. In the interest of national unity we will not re-introduce the Industrial Relations Act. Equally, no government should pursue a policy of wholesale nationalisation for party ends nor seek to further the interests of only a section or a class of the population. And certainly our economic condition is far too grave for our country to be subjected to a divisive and dogmatic attack upon the private enterprise sector of our economy.  Inflation has dogged Britain since the war because as a country we have too often paid ourselves more than we earn. Lately this chronic inflation has been made acute by the explosion in the world price of food and raw materials.  We need to bring back confidence in our currency; we need to stop paying ourselves more than we produce; and we need to produce more than we have produced in the past.  To restore confidence in our currency we propose a comprehensive price stabilisation programme. This will use every tolerable means available to fight inflation. We will rigorously control public spending and the money supply and there must be restraint in prices and incomes.  Because of the economic crisis there is no room for any early improvement in living standards. But our aim is to protect people's real income as far as it is possible to do so - by increasing pensions and other long4erm benefits every six months, by developing new forms of savings protected against inflation, and by pay arrangements which take account of rises in the cost of living.  This is a far better way of protecting the interests of people at work than the excessive increases in some wage settlements over the last few months. These merely feed inflation and lead eventually to heavy unemployment. We believe that our attempt to protect the real value of wages, combined with the responsible self-interest of trade unions, should make a voluntary policy on pay and prices effective. But no government could honestly say that it will never be necessary to use the law in the national interest to support an effective policy for fighting inflation. In the absence of a viable prices and incomes policy any government would have to take harsher financial and economic measures than would otherwise be needed.  Restraint and restriction are only palliatives. The best way of solving Britain's economic problems is by increasing our productivity and expanding British agriculture. It is only by producing more wealth that we can significantly help those who need help: the poor, the sick and the old. There is enormous scope for improving productivity, and our taxation and industrial policies will be directed towards this objective.  Yet only part of our troubles are economic, and inflation is not the only threat to our free way of life. Modern industrial society is fragile. It is vulnerable to the terrorist and the anarchist. But at present an even greater danger is the short-sighted selfishness of some powerful groups. The great technological advances of this century have closely integrated our economy and the whole organisation of national life. This integration has brought immense material advantages, but by laying society open to disruption it has brought weakness as well. The whole is at the mercy of a part to an extent unimagined even a few years ago.  Nevertheless no part of the nation can exist by itself. Disruption may bring temporary advantage to a few, but all are hurt in the end. The nation is diminished and impoverished by it.  Trade unions are an important estate of the realm. We shall co-operate closely with them, and we hope that our proposals for industrial partnership will lead to close and effective co-operation both with employees and management. But we shall not be dominated by the trade unions. They are not the government of the country.  We believe that the survival of a mixed economy is vital to national prosperity. If all economic power were in the hands of politicians and civil servants, if all economic and industrial decisions were taken in Whitehall, Britain would become a dictatorship. An all-powerful government is the end of freedom.  A mixed economy ensures the diffusion of power. That is the only way we can prevent the abuse of power. Hence, the destruction of the mixed economy would entail the destruction of our democratic liberties, and the end of our parliamentary democracy.  Obviously the struggle against inflation and the gravity of Britain's economic predicament prevent us from doing immediately all the things we should like to do. Like everyone else, governments must practise restraint.  In the present economic emergency it would be irresponsible for any government to pretend that there can be general increases in public spending in real terms. This means having to postpone many of the things we would like to do straightaway. Only as we overcome our economic difficulties will it be possible to carry through the proposals in the second part of this Manifesto which involve expenditure. These proposals therefore are all subject to this important qualification.  But we will act now in three areas which have been particularly hard hit by inflation and which in one way or another affect the basic livelihood of every family in the country - pensions, housing and food production. Our plans for these, which are set out later, will cost money; and in order to prevent inflationary consequences, it may be necessary to make cuts in public spending or increases in taxation. But as Britain's economic position improves, our general objective will be to reduce the burden of taxation.  Our policies will lead to a united nation. We shall uphold the law and the authority of Parliament. It is in Parliament, not in the streets, that national policies must be worked out and disputes resolved.  Our nation still possesses great moral reserves. Our patriotism, our knowledge that what unites us is far more significant than what divides us, our pride in our way of life and in our institutions, our sense of history, our idealism, our wish to make our country better and to improve the lot of our fellow citizens - all these feelings and beliefs remain strong in Britain. But they can only be properly summoned to the service of our nation by a government that commands the confidence of the country because it puts the country first.  The Conservative Party, free from dogma and free from dependence upon any single interest, is broadly based throughout the nation. It is our objective to win a clear majority in the House of Commons in this election. But we will use that majority above all to unite the nation. We will not govern in a narrow partisan spirit. After the election we will consult and confer with the leaders of other parties and with the leaders of the great interests in the nation, in order to secure for the government's policies the consent and support of all men and women of good will. We will invite people from outside the ranks of our party to join with us in overcoming Britain's difficulties. The nation's crisis should transcend party differences.  In any event, as a national Party we will pursue a national policy in the interests of the nation as a whole. We will lead a national effort. In normal times the party struggle is the safeguard of freedom. But the times are far from normal. In a crisis like this, it is the national interest which must prevail. We will ensure that it does.  For all the people  THE CHALLENGE WE BELIEVE THAT, WORKING TOGETHER AS A NATION, WE CAN SOLVE OUR PROBLEMS. IT WILL NOT BE EASY. IT WILL DEMAND RESTRAINT AND SACRIFICE. IT WILL MEAN POSTPONING SOME OF OUR PLANS AND RECOGNISING THAT WE SHALL ONLY BE ABLE TO DO ALL THE THINGS WE WANT IF OUR ECONOMIC AND INDUSTRIAL POLICIES SUCCEED. THAT SHOULD NOT PREVENT US PLANNING FOR THE FUTURE; AND IN THIS SECOND PART OF THE MANIFESTO WE SET OUT SOME OF OUR LONGER TERM AND MORE AMBITIOUS AIMS IN ADDITION TO OUR IMMEDIATE PROPOSALS FOR TACKLING THE CRISIS.  PAYING FOR OUR PROGRAMME If we are going to make further advances in both individual prosperity and social provision, then we need first to set our economic house in order. But there are some things - housing, pensions and food production - which we believe have to be done now. In order to pay for these extra commitments immediately we may have either to make public spending cuts elsewhere or to raise taxes to meet the cost. But our general objective for taxes is simple we aim to lower them. We are happy for this promise to be matched against our record. Nevertheless, we give warning that in the present economic climate it might prove necessary to raise some taxes in order to pay for immediate objectives.  POLITICS IS ABOUT PEOPLE OUR PLANS ARE FIRMLY ROOTED IN OUR BELIEF THAT GOVERNMENT AND POLITICS ARE ABOUT PEOPLE. As Conservatives, we have always acted on the principle that government has a clear responsibility to help and protect those who cannot look after themselves. At the same time, we believe that the strength and value of any society lies in individual freedom, effort and achievement. These complementary themes are more relevant than ever today.  PEOPLE FEEL INCREASINGLY FRUSTRATED AND EVEN OPPRESSED BY THE IMPACT ON THEIR LIVES OF REMOTE BUREAUCRACY, AND OF EVENTS WHICH SEEM TO BE ENTIRELY BEYOND THEIR CONTROL OR THAT OF OUR DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS. What is more, there is a serious political challenge from the Left to that fine balance between economic freedom and social provision which has made this country such a civilised place to live in: the balance between giving everyone the chance to achieve and excel and looking after those who cannot look after themselves.  WE DO NOT BELIEVE THAT THE GREAT MAJORITY OF PEOPLE WANT REVOLUTIONARY CHANGE IN SOCIETY, OR FOR THAT MATTER THAT THE FUTURE HAPPINESS OF OUR SOCIETY DEPENDS ON COMPLETELY ALTERING IT. There is no majority for a massive extension of nationalisation. There is no majority for the continued harrying of private enterprise. There is no majority for penalising those who save, own property or make profits. People are not clamouring for Whitehall to seize even greater control over their lives. They want more choice and diversity, not less.  PEOPLE WANT TO BE HELPED TO ACHIEVE, NOT ENCOURAGED TO ENVY. They want a decent home - and most of them want to own it themselves. They want security for their families. They want to be fairly rewarded for hard and responsible and useful work. They want to be protected from the ravages of inflation. They want decent schools for their children and a say in how they are taught. They want to be able to retire in comfort, free from financial worries. They want to live in a society where excellence and compassion go hand in hand, and where the rules and the laws are made and upheld by the free Parliament of a free people. The achievement of such a society will be the aim of the next Conservative government.  People and prices  THE FIRST PRIORITY THE FIRST PRIORITY FOR ANY GOVERNMENT MUST BE TO DEFEND THE VALUE OF THE CURRENCY AND TO BRING INFLATION DOWN FROM THE PRESENT RUINOUS RATES. THIS CANNOT BE DONE OVERNIGHT; IT CANNOT BE DONE BY USING ONLY ONE WEAPON; AND IT CANNOT BE DONE WITHOUT UNITED EFFORT. IF IT IS NOT DONE, THE EFFECTS ON EVERY FAMILY WILL BE CALAMITOUS.  CONTROLLING PUBLIC SPENDING We will bring in a comprehensive price stabilisation programme which will use every tolerable means available to fight inflation. There must be restraint in prices and incomes and we will rigorously control public spending and the money supply, which is a vital, though not the only, part of our counter-inflation armoury. We will look hard at local government expenditure which has rocketed in the last few years.  THE PRICE COMMISSION We will continue the work of the Price Commission, which we set up, but we will review the Price Code to make it more flexible, to stimulate investment and to help provide jobs. In a time of roaring inflation, price controls are necessary. But if they are too rigid, the money needed by companies to stimulate investment and to help provide jobs dries up. More efficient industrial effort is to the long-term advantage of the consumer. We will also encourage competition between companies and will build on the reforms introduced by our Fair Trading Act.  INCOMES Every reasonable person knows that if we pay ourselves higher wages than we can afford, sooner or later we shall have to pay higher bills than we can afford. There is the very real danger of a worsening wages explosion this autumn and winter at precisely the time when world prices are starting to ease. At the moment when we might stand a chance of getting on top of inflation, it would be madness to give another twist to the inflationary spiral. We must therefore as a matter of urgency, work out with the trade unions and the employers a fair and effective policy for prices and incomes. We believe that the great majority of the trade union movement will be prepared to work with the democratically elected government of the country for the public good. If after all our efforts we fail to get a comprehensive voluntary policy we shall need to support the voluntary restraint that _is_ achieved with the back-up of the law. It would be irresponsible and dishonest totally to rule this out, but the various methods no less than the principle would need to be widely discussed. In the absence of an effective prices and incomes policy any Government would have to take harsher financial and economic measures than would otherwise be necessary.  A BETTER INDUSTRIAL FORUM To build a more responsible partnership between government, the unions and the employers, we must strengthen the existing National Economic Development Council as a better industrial forum. One of its main tasks will be to discuss how much of the nation's resources are available for pay, for investment, for exports and for public spending.  FAIRER REWARDS FOR HARD WORK AND RESPONSIBILITY We would also try to reach an agreement on a new, fair and sensible system for adjusting the relative rates of pay between different groups without adding to inflation. There is a widespread acceptance that those who do particularly demanding work should enjoy an improvement in their relative pay. Yet without some national, independent body on pay relativities, this kind of improvement will prove difficult if not impossible.  INCOME PROTECTION For our price stabilisation programme to succeed, it must enjoy the consent of the British people. This means offering them some assurance of INCOME PROTECTION so that, as far as possible, incomes keep pace with the cost of living to help safeguard real living standards. Our programme involves:  -   Moving from an annual to a six-monthly increase in retirement       pensions, public service pensions and other long-term benefits.  -   Seeking new forms of saving schemes for the small saver protected as       far as possible against inflation. We will extend the principle of       special indexed and inflation-proofed savings.  -   Pay arrangements for wage and salary earners to take account of       increases in the cost of living.  This is the only fair and honest approach at a time when there is no immediate prospect of an increase in living standards. It protects the interests of pensioners, trade unionists and employees. We have considered taking our income proposals much further and introducing full-scale indexation, which has a growing number of advocates. We do not believe that this would be the best way of protecting people from inflation if all it did was to help us to live with inflation rather than cutting back the rate of inflation itself. Nevertheless, while we are tackling the crisis it is right to take some practical steps to help protect living standards and savings, and this we propose to do.  FOOD PRICES Food prices make up a large part of every family's budget, and we know that the rise in the cost of food over the last few years largely caused by events outside the control of this country or outside the Common Market has hit many people hard. The present Government's answer has been essentially political and cosmetic. Their food subsidies have proved wasteful. Only £1 out of every £4 has gone to those in real need and the subsidies are being paid for by taxes on a whole range of goods and services which figure in the budget of every ordinary family. It would have been better to help the less well-off families direct. With the urgent. need to stabilise prices we accept that it will be necessary to retain these subsidies for the time being.  MORE HOME-GROWN FOOD IN THE LONGER TERM, IF WE WANT MORE STABLE FOOD PRICES IN THE SHOPS AND A HEALTHIER BALANCE OF PAYMENTS THE ANSWER MUST BE A CONSIDERABLE EXPANSION OF BRITISH AGRICULTURE. Given the right lead and help from government, our farmers and farmworkers are capable of making an even greater contribution to our economy than ever before. In today's unpredictable world, it is vital that they should. What British agriculture needs above all is reassurance and confidence about the future.  After 1970, British agriculture enjoyed a remarkable resurgence of confidence. The result was a healthy increase in the supply of home-grown food for the consumer. But in recent months the industry has suffered severely as a result of the uncertainty over Europe caused by the present Government and their failure to take action to deal with the grain crisis and inflation.  Our farmers must be given the necessary confidence as rapidly as possible to expand their industry once again. To do this, a Conservative government will undertake an immediate review of agriculture, both nationally and on a Community basis, followed by a cash injection as in 1970. We shall have thorough consultations with the industry over the serious problems caused by the rise in feedingstuff costs, and restore a guarantee for beef producers. We will work out with the industry a more efficient system of marketing. We will continue to press for improvements in the European Common Agricultural Policy and work to safeguard the interests of horticulturalists and other specialist producers. We shall remove the immensely damaging threat of Labour's wealth tax proposals to the family farm. Our aim is to ensure that at a time of uncertainty over world food supplies, the British housewife can enjoy the benefits of more home-grown food that those who work on the land are certainly capable of producing.  The Restrictive Trade Practices legislation has led to some unexpected difficulties for agricultural cooperatives. We shall introduce amendments to ensure that such organisations are able to carry out the sensible purposes for which they exist.  THE FISHING INDUSTRY It is also in the national interest, and in the interest of every housewife, to safeguard our fishing industry. The overriding need here is to conserve stocks. We support the move towards internationally agreed limits of 200 miles. In order to protect our waters and our fishing industry from over-fishing by foreign boats, we made special arrangements to protect the interests of inshore fishermen during our negotiations for entry into the European Community. When these arrangements come up for review in 1982, we will make sure that the special interests of the inshore industry continue to be protected.  People and industry  ENCOURAGING EFFICIENT PRODUCTION THE MOST POSITIVE ELEMENT IN OUR PRICE STABILISATION PROGRAMME WILL BE MEASURES TO ENCOURAGE EFFICIENT PRODUCTION. There are no short cuts to building a new prosperity. There is no alternative to improved efficiency, higher productivity and increased production. No government, whatever its colour, can simply switch on economic growth by itself. It depends on the hard work, skills and enterprise of the British people.  Our taxation and industrial policies will therefore be designed to encourage firms to invest more money in new plant and machinery in our factories. It is here that we have fallen behind other industrial countries. In the last few months, investment and industrial confidence have received a terrible and deliberate battering. Taxation has clawed back much of the cash which industry needs. Threats of nationalisation have destroyed confidence. It is time to call a halt to these immensely damaging policies. Above all, we must recognise that in a mixed economy like ours, economic success depends very largely on private enterprise. One of the most valuable things we c9uld do for industry would be to assure it that for several years ahead, there would be no threat of new nationalisation or more state direction.  We will introduce a major reform of company law as proposed during the period of our last administration.  HELP FOR THE REGIONS We want a partnership with industry based on trust, not a relationship of hostility and compulsion. One important ingredient of that partnership must be continuity of policy; when policies are endlessly chopped and changed, investment plans are damaged. That is why, for example, we intend to continue the regional policies which we pursued in office. In less than two years these provided or safeguarded over 50,000 jobs in schemes which received selective assistance under our Industry Act. WE WILL SEEK TO REBUILD CONFIDENCE IN THE REGIONS, OFFERING TO INDUSTRY CONTINUITY OF ASSISTANCE IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE A REAL BREAK-THROUGH IN SOLVING LONG TERM PROBLEMS. The now threatened rise in unemployment will be especially heavy if we do not succeed in restraining inflationary wage demands. This makes sensible policies for helping the regions more vital than ever.  SMALL BUSINESSES WE WANT ALSO TO HELP THE SMALL, OFTEN FAMILY-OWNED BUSINESSES WHICH FORM THE BACKBONE OF BRITISH ENTERPRISE. They employ a third of workers in the private sector and are immensely important to the economic life of Britain and to future industrial growth. The last Conservative government recognised their importance by appointing, for the first time, a Minister with specific responsibility for small businesses and by implementing many of the recommendations of the Bolton Committee on Small Businesses. In the recent Parliament, the Conservative Opposition won improved tax relief for small businesses which the Labour government opposed. A new Conservative government will keep under review the profit levels under which small firms are entitled to relief on corporation tax.  THE IMPACT OF WEALTH AND GIFTS TAXES Small businesses often face the problem of long-term finance. We will therefore set up an enquiry, to report within twelve months, into the availability and adequacy of long-term finance for small firms. Small businesses are also vulnerable to capital taxation and estate duty. The present government's proposed wealth tax and gifts tax could lead to the break-up of many small firms and a loss of jobs for those employed in them. In our overall reform of capital taxation, we will seek to find ways of shielding small businesses from taxes that might otherwise cripple them, destroy jobs and harm the economy.  Too many small businesses are being squeezed out of city-centres in redevelopments. To help prevent this, we will ask all planning authorities to take into account the social contribution of small shopkeepers and other small concerns when considering city-centre redevelopments.  INFLATION ACCOUNTING There are other areas where we would seek early co-operation with industry. Inflation at the present rate has a seriously distorting effect on company profitability, given the methods of accounting generally employed in Britain today. As a result, companies are finding themselves paying taxes on profits which are to a considerable extent paper profits and do not reflect real values. This is damaging to the economy since it means a further drain on funds for investment. The last Conservative government set up the Sandilands Committee to report and make recommendations on methods of inflation-accounting. We hope that this Committee will be able to produce its Report very soon and we will encourage it to do so. As soon as it reports, we will enter into immediate discussions with industry and the accounting profession on a changeover to methods of accounting which more accurately reflect company profitability.  INCENTIVES FOR GREATER PRODUCTIVITY We also want to consider with industry ways of improving productivity. There is enormous scope in Britain for doing this, and the impact on our national prosperity and on that of every family would be considerable. We shall therefore examine straightaway the possibility of introducing in this country the sort of national scheme which operates in France for giving a fair share of the increased profits made by individual firms to those whose efforts produce improved performance and to those who make their contribution by investing their savings in new factories and new machinery.  SELF-SUFFICIENCY IN ENERGY The energy industries are specially vital to our economic performance, as events over the last year have shown. The days of cheap and abundant energy have gone for good. But Britain is more fortunate than most other industrial countries in having substantial natural reserves of coal, oil and gas. There are two clear lessons to be learned from last year's energy crisis: first, the urgent need to make Britain as self-sufficient in energy as possible; secondly, to make sure that Britain is able to depend on a variety of different sources of energy.  COAL We support the general strategy for coal agreed during 1974 with the industry. Our aim will be to make the industry viable so that it can provide an assured and prosperous future for all those who work in it. An important element will be the establishment of a productivity scheme.  NORTH SEA OIL In exploiting the oil reserves around the United Kingdom, there are three essential requirements. First, the British people must retain control of, and enjoy, the maximum benefits from our off-shore oil. The answer is not to spend £2,000 million or more of the taxpayers' money in nationalising 51 per cent of the industry. Nationalisation is inefficient, hugely expensive and totally unnecessary. The desired results can be achieved just as effectively, and far more cheaply, through taxation and regulation. Taxation will provide Britain with revenue from the oil. A Conservative government will, therefore, block the existing corporation tax loopholes and introduce a new additional tax on North Sea oil profits. At the same time, our proposed new regulations will give the government all the control that it needs. We will establish an Oil Conservation Authority to act as a watchdog. Its job will be to regulate exploration for oil, investment, production and sales in accordance with general policy directives laid down by the Government.  SCOTLAND AND NORTH SEA OIL Secondly, the Scottish people must enjoy more of the financial benefits from oil, and they must be given a far greater say over its operation in Scotland. We will, therefore, establish a Scottish Development Fund. This will provide immediate cash help to solve the problems created by oil development, but beyond that it will lay the foundation for Scotland's long4erm economic prosperity. We will move the Oil Production Division of the Department of Energy to Scotland and encourage the oil industry to locate their UK production headquarters in Scotland.  NO DELAY Thirdly, we must produce enough oil to meet Britain's needs by 1980. This means allowing the oil industry to press ahead with the minimum of hindrance, with the development of our oil resources. Already, the threat of nationalisation is causing considerable delay in the development of North Sea oilfields.  NUCLEAR POWER We will carry through the recently announced pilot programme of nuclear power stations based on the British designed 'heavy water' system. We believe that a larger nuclear programme must be initiated at an early date. In all nuclear matters, safety and reliability must be our paramount considerations.  ENERGY SAVING Events over the last year have highlighted the need for energy conservation. There is a lot that government can do to help and give a lead, for example by encouraging adequate home insulation and by giving the necessary support for research and development. But big savings of energy, which will help the nation's balance of payments and everyone's pocket, can only be made if the whole country makes some contribution. People often ask - 'What can we do to help beat the crisis?' One really useful thing that many of us could do is to cut down voluntarily on the amount of energy that we use, particularly oil. We will start urgent talks with every interest - local authorities, industry, voluntary agencies, consumer groups and so on - with this objective.  People at work  PARTNERSHIP IN INDUSTRY WE WANT TO PROMOTE PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN GOVERNMENT AND INDUSTRY, AND PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN THOSE WHO WORK TOGETHER IN INDUSTRY. IT IS ON THIS THAT OUR CHANCES OF OVERCOMING THE COUNTRY'S ECONOMIC DIFFICULTIES AND LAYING THE FOUNDATIONS OF A NEW PROSPERITY FOR EVERYONE WILL DEPEND.  THE LAW AND INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS Governments of both parties have tried to establish a new legal framework within which industrial relations could develop. As we have said elsewhere, we still believe that our own legislation was soundly based and unfairly attacked, but in view of the hostility which it aroused we will not reintroduce it. We accept the Trade Union and Labour Relations Act, introduced by the present government and sensibly amended by Parliament, as the basis for the law on trade union organisation and as the legal framework for collective bargaining. We hope that our decision will help create a better climate for industrial partnership.  EMPLOYEE PARTICIPATION To strengthen this partnership, we will lay a formal duty on all large and medium-sized firms to consult employee representatives on a wide range of subjects. This is necessary not only for economic reasons but also because a better understanding is important in its own right. We want to leave the precise methods and procedures as flexible as possible, but we have it in mind that the subjects covered should range from disciplinary and dismissal procedures and redundancy arrangements to consultations about methods of working, and profit-sharing and share-ownership schemes. These proposals should lay the foundation for future developments in employee participation at every level of the enterprise, but it is much too soon to be dogmatic about the exact form of participation in management.  Much can be learned about the right to consultation at work from the success achieved by certain companies. The government in particular will need to set a clear example with its own employees and the nationalised industries will be expected to play their part.  OTHER RIGHTS AT WORK We will protect and extend other rights of workers, after consultations with both sides of industry. Our objectives are:  -   TO GIVE EMPLOYEES THE RIGHT TO HOLD UNION MEETINGS ON THE PREMISES       OF THEIR EMPLOYER;  -   TO GIVE UNION MEMBERS THE OPPORTUNITY TO ELECT THE LEADERS OF THEIR       UNION BY A POSTAL BALLOT, WITH ADEQUATE HELP FROM THE GOVERNMENT       TO COVER THE EXPENSE;  -   TO SEEK EFFECTIVE WAYS OF PROVIDING GOVERNMENT ASSISTANCE FOR THE       TRAINING OF SHOP STEWARDS AND UNION OFFICERS;  -   TO SEEK WAYS OF REGULATING THE CONDUCT OF PICKETING BASED ON THE       STRICT ARRANGEMENTS ADOPTED BY THE NATIONAL UNION OF MINEWORKERS       IN FEBRUARY 1974.  REDUNDANCY PAYMENTS We also believe that the time is now overdue for a review of the system of payments for redundancy and the arrangements for redundancy in general. We must take account of developments in Europe, and consider relating payments to need, linking arrangements for redundancy with arrangements for industrial retraining, and improving the arrangements for collective redundancy.  STRIKES AND THE TAXPAYER We believe it is right that the unions themselves should accept a significant share of the responsibility for the welfare of the families of men who go on strike, and that the whole burden should not fall on the taxpayer. Equally, it is right that the families of strikers should not suffer unnecessary hardship. We will discuss with trade unions and employers how best to meet these two aims.  JOB SATISFACTION Much of the friction in our industrial relations is a symptom of the frustration and boredom found in many jobs in m9dern industry. The scope for improving job satisfaction is considerable. The primary responsibility must rest with management. A Conservative government will accordingly bring together government, management and the trade unions, to promote research into ways of improving and extending job satisfaction and to give advice. This will benefit individual workers, industrial relations in general and the community at large by improving the tone and atmosphere of our industrial civilisation.  People and taxes  A RESPONSIBLE APPROACH TO TAXATION We believe as Conservatives that people should keep as much of what they earn as is consistent with the responsibility of government to provide adequate services for the whole community. This is the most practical way to reward and therefore encourage effort, and it provides the best guarantee of individual choice and freedom. In present circumstances it would be irresponsible to promise large reductions in tax rates; and as we said earlier, if we cannot find the money to pay for additional programmes through cutting spending on other things it may be necessary to increase some taxes in the short term. But, as circumstances allow, we shall reduce the burden of tax on individuals and industry alike, as we have done in the past.  Above all, the tax system must be fair, and be seen to be fair. The last Conservative government went a long way towards making it fairer. Higher personal allowances gave proportionately more help to the less well-off taxpayers. The unified system of income tax brought relief to retired people living on small investment incomes.  Our proposals for helping older people and low income groups through personal allowances and the tax credit scheme respectively will be found later in this Manifesto.  TAXATION ON CAPITAL We shall also seek to bring greater fairness into the whole system of taxation on capital. We do not oppose this in principle - for example, we already have in this country death duties and capital gains tax. What we do oppose are ill-considered and damaging additional burdens piled on top of existing penal and comprehensive taxes. Britain already has higher taxes on both capital and income than other countries - with a top rate for income tax of 98 per cent. Tax on tax on tax: this is a prescription, not for a fairer society, but for a poorer and more bitter one. It is wrong to reform capital taxation in a piecemeal way without full consideration of the effects. We will examine the whole system of taxation on capital with the aim of making the system more fair, less a matter in its application of chance or skill in avoidance, and less damaging to the thrift, saving and investment on which our future depends.  The last Conservative government raised the starting point for estate duty so that property passing from husband to wife (or vice versa) is exempt up to £30,000. An important part of our reform of capital taxation will be to extend this limit so that no estate duty is payable until the death of the surviving husband or wife. At present, relations sharing the family home may be forced to sell it in order to meet estate duties on the death of parents, brothers or sisters. We shall extend the relief at present enjoyed by widows or widowers to safeguard the matrimonial home to cover close relatives living in the same house.  People and rates  People pay tax not only to national government but to local government as well in the form of rates.  Local authority expenditure has been growing faster than the economy as a whole. Although on average 60 per cent of this expenditure is met by grant from the taxpayer, the burden on the domestic ratepayer has risen sharply. The rating system itself has come under increasing criticism because it does not reflect people's ability to pay.  Further heavy increases in rates are forecast. In these circumstances Conservatives will take the following steps.  TRANSFERRING EXPENDITURE First, we shall transfer to central government in the medium term, the cost of teachers' salaries up to a specified number of teachers for each local education authority. Expenditure on police and the fire services will qualify for increased grants from the Exchequer. We shall see that this saving is passed on to the ratepayer.  FAIRER TAXES SECONDLY, WITHIN THE NORMAL LIFETIME OF A PARLIAMENT WE SHALL ABOLISH THE DOMESTIC RATING SYSTEM AND REPLACE IT BY TAXES MORE BROADLY BASED AND RELATED TO PEOPLE'S ABILITY TO PAY. Local authorities must continue to have some independent source of finance.  People and their homes  TACKLING THE NATION'S HOUSING NEEDS IS SECOND ONLY TO THE FIGHT AGAINST INFLATION ON OUR AGENDA.  TWO MAIN OBJECTIVES We have two main objectives. First, we want to see that enough homes are provided for the families that need them. This means, among other things, trying to ensure a steady flow of funds for the construction industry and concentrating help where it is really needed - for example, in the inner city areas where our proposal for establishing Social Priority Areas (set out in more detail later) will greatly help.  Secondly, 51 per cent of houses are at present owner-occupied. There are many families who would like to own their home but for one reason or another cannot do so. It is our purpose to extend the opportunities for home ownership to as many of them as possible. The Conservative ideal is a property-owning democracy.  MORTGAGE RATES THE FIRST PART OF OUR PROGRAMME FOR DOING THIS IS TO REDUCE THE INTEREST RATE CHARGED BY BUILDING SOCIETIES TO HOME BUYERS TO 9½ PER CENT AND ENSURE THAT IT DOES NOT RISE ABOVE THAT FIGURE. At the moment, societies have to offer those who are saving money with them the going interest rate for their investment. Without government action, any rise in this rate is passed on virtually automatically to the home buyer. But by varying the rate of tax payable by the building societies (known as the composite rate) when interest rates in general rise, the Government can enable the societies to attract sufficient funds without passing on the full increase in the rate to the purchaser. This step will help _all_ home buyers - both new buyers and those existing buyers who have to struggle to find the extra money each month for the increased mortgage repayments for which they were unprepared.  A number of questions have been raised about the liquidity and reserve ratios of building societies, the legal restrictions on them, and the possibility of widening their powers so that they can operate more flexibly. In order to settle these matters, we shall set up a one year enquiry to sit full4ime and to make recommendations to the government on the future role and structure of the societies.  HELP WITH THE DEPOSIT OUR SECOND PROPOSAL IS TO GIVE FIRST-TIME PURCHASERS OF PRIVATE HOUSES AND FLATS SPECIAL HELP IN PAYING THE DEPOSIT. We will start a Home Savings Grant Scheme in which people who save regularly with building societies under schemes approved by the government will receive a grant proportionate to their savings. The Government will contribute £1 for every £2 saved up to a given ceiling.  This scheme would take at least two years to mature in order to give builders sufficient time to increase the supply of homes for sale. Without this, the extra grant would raise prices since more money would be chasing the same number of homes.  Several kinds of low start mortgages are already available. We shall encourage a greater variety of house purchase schemes to fit different circumstances.  SALE OF COUNCIL HOUSES AND FLATS OUR THIRD PROPOSAL FOR EXTENDING HOME OWNERSHIP IS TO GIVE A NEW DEAL TO EVERY COUNCIL TENANT WHO HAS BEEN IN HIS HOME FOR THREE YEARS OR MORE. THESE TENANTS WILL HAVE THE RIGHT TO PURCHASE THEIR HOMES AT A PRICE ONE-THIRD BELOW MARKET VALUE. The community will no longer tolerate the attitude of councils which, for narrow partisan reasons, stand in the way of their tenants becoming homeowners. We will therefore place a duty on every council to sell homes on these terms - giving their tenants what amounts to a 100 per cent mortgage with no deposit. It is of course only right that a tenant who buys his home should surrender the appropriate portion of any capital gain if he re-sells it within five years.  VOLUNTARY HOUSING MOVEMENT We shall support the voluntary housing movement and the Housing Corporation, both of which have benefited from new measures originally introduced in our Housing and Planning Bill. Housing Associations will continue to provide dwellings to rent as an alternative to local authorities.  RENTS We will continue the freeze on rents until the end of the year. When we have examined the reports of the Rent Scrutiny Boards, we will consider how increases can gradually be implemented in the light of our policies for fighting inflation. Families in need, whether in furnished or unfurnished accommodation, will continue to receive help with their rent as provided for the first time by law under the Conservative Housing Finance Act.  MODERNISING OLDER HOUSES A policy of maintaining and modernising older houses is often preferable to demolition and rebuilding. The original scheme for home improvement was subject to certain abuses but these have now been removed. In all, our improvement programme resulted in 1 million homes receiving grants under the last Conservative government. We will continue this programme since it is exceptionally important to keep our older houses in good condition and to keep established communities together.  People in retirement  INFLATION HITS THE OLD AND THE RETIRED ESPECIALLY HARD AND IN OUR TAX AND SOCIAL SERVICE POLICIES WE MUST DO ALL WE CAN TO PROTECT THEM. AND IN A COMPASSIONATE SOCIETY THEY, LIKE PEOPLE IN NEED, HAVE THE RIGHT TO LOOK FORWARD TO A BETTER STANDARD OF LIVING.  SIX-MONTHLY REVIEWS We will act first to protect the value of the pension. With prices rising as fast as they are, annual reviews are too infrequent. A CONSERVATIVE GOVERNMENT WILL THEREFORE INCREASE RETIREMENT PENSIONS (AS WELL AS OTHER LONG-TERM BENEFITS) AND PUBLIC SERVICE PENSIONS EVERY SIX MONTHS. We will make sure that the burden of paying for improved pensions is fairly shared. THE SELF-EMPLOYED IN PARTICULAR SHOULD NOT HAVE TO FACE THE HUGE INCREASES IN CONTRIBUTIONS PROPOSED BY THE PRESENT GOVERNMENT. Our development of inflation-proofed savings schemes will help those who want to add to their retirement pension by putting money aside during their working lives.  SECOND PENSION SCHEME The pension prospects of millions of people in employment have been damaged by the present government's decision to abandon the Conservative Second Pension Scheme. Under the Conservative scheme, which was all set to come into operation, twelve million people would have started building up a second pension from April 1975. The present government has put a stop to this. The next Conservative government will reactivate the Second Pension Scheme to start as soon as possible, and at the latest by April 1976. With this as a foundation, we shall introduce further improvements, in particular to make still better second pension provision for women. We will make sure that married women in employment retain their right not to pay the full contribution to the State basic scheme.  HIGHER PERSONAL ALLOWANCES FOR OLDER PEOPLE We recognise the special needs of older people, often trapped by rising expenses that they cannot escape, and without the opportunity to increase their incomes as younger people can. Therefore, when we can afford to do so, we shall introduce higher personal tax allowances for people over 65. This will give a real rise in after-tax income to many older taxpayers who at present pay tax at a penal rate of 55 per cent immediately their income becomes subject to tax.  ABOLITION OF THE EARNINGS RULE We believe that the earnings rule is socially harmful as well as widely resented. It discourages able men and women, merely because of their age, from making a contribution to society which would help both them and the rest of us. We have relaxed the earnings rule in the past and we will relax it further. We will abolish it as soon as resources allow.  People in need  PRIORITIES AND INFLATION The record of the last Conservative government in giving new help to people in special need was by any reckoning remarkably successful. But rising standards only highlight the inadequacies that still persist. And inflation makes them worse. To tackle all these will cost money - and, as we have said throughout, cash and resources will be severely limited over the next few years. This underlines the need, greater now than ever, for establishing a clear set of priorities.  Our first priority in the social services, as we have made clear, is to look after the pensioners and other families dependent on long-term social security benefits by reviewing these benefits every six months. This is the best way of protecting them against rising prices, and it must be our first task.  THE TAX CREDIT SCHEME The speed at which we can carry out our other main social policies will depend largely on the economic situation and the resources that become available. BUT THE CENTRE-PIECE OF OUR SOCIAL PROGRAMME WILL be THE TAX-CREDIT SCHEME - THE MOST ADVANCED ANTI-POVERTY PROGRAMME SET IN HAND BY ANY WESTERN COUNTRY. THIS SCHEME WILL PROVIDE CASH HELP, RELATED TO FAMILY CIRCUMSTANCES, AUTOMATICALLY AND WITHOUT SPECIAL MEANS TEST. IT WILL BE OF SPECIAL HELP TO PENSIONERS AND TO HARD-PRESSED FAMILIES WITH LOW INCOMES, ESPECIALLY WHERE THERE ARE CHILDREN. OUR INTENTION IS TO ENSURE THAT ULTIMATELY NO FAMILY IN THE LAND NEED REMAIN IN POVERTY. Tragically the present government have set their face against this scheme. We will establish the framework for tax credits as soon as we can and bring the scheme into effect in stages, as economic circumstances permit.  CHILD CREDITS AS A FIRST STEP TOWARDS ESTABLISHING THE TAX CREDIT SCHEME, WE WILL INTRODUCE A SYSTEM OF CHILD CREDITS WHEN ECONOMIC CIRCUMSTANCES ALLOW. THESE WILL BE AVAILABLE FOR ALL CHILDREN, INCLUDING THE FIRST CHILD. CHILD CREDITS WILL TAKE THE PLACE OF THE FAMILY ALLOWANCES AND TAX ALLOWANCES. THE WHOLE OF THE NEW CHILD CREDITS WILL BE PAYABLE TO MOTHERS IN CASH IN EXACTLY THE SAME WAY AS EXISTING FAMILY ALLOWANCES, THE ONLY DIFFERENCE BEING THAT THEY WILL BE WORTH MORE.  SINGLE-PARENT FAMILIES Single-parent families face many financial and social problems, to which the Finer Report has recently drawn attention. We are studying the Report very carefully and will take action in the light of its recommendations.  CHRONICALLY SICK AND DISABLED PEOPLE One of the particular achievements of the last Conservative government was to introduce new benefits for chronically ill and severely disabled people. We shall continue this work. As resources become available, we shall establish as of right, a new benefit - modest to begin with, but A start - for those disabled people who have never been able TO undertake regular work and for married women so disabled that they cannot look after their homes and families. We shall also improve the vehicle service for disabled people in the light of the Sharp Report: the minimum aim must be to see that all those who now qualify for 'three wheelers' will be able to exchange them for cars if they wish to do so.  EARNINGS RULE WE WILL RELAX THE EARNINGS RULE IN RELATION TO SUPPLEMENTARY BENEFIT SO AS TO ENABLE WIDOWS TO MAKE A REAL CONTRIBUTION TO THE LIVING STANDARDS OF THEIR FAMILIES, AND WE WILL SEE THAT THE EARNINGS OF CHILDREN AT SCHOOL ARE ENTIRELY DISREGARDED.  THE NATIONAL HEALTH SERVICE The National Health Service now faces acute difficulties, which are made all the worse by the impact of inflation. In present economic circumstances, it will not be easy even to maintain existing standards. That is why it is so wrong to reject any acceptable method of channelling additional resources into Britain's health services. The present government's commitment to scrap all Health Service charges at a cost of £100 million is bound to make the problems of the National Health Service worse. For the same reason we reject the present government's plans for abolishing private practice in association with the National Health Service. This is unacceptable in principle; it would also reduce the skills available to patients generally and would cost nearly £30 million a year. We shall safeguard the right of people to make provision for their own health and that of their families. What is now needed in the National Health Service is a period of comparative stability, founded upon the reorganisation that we carried through, which must now be allowed to settle down.  On pay there is considerable criticism of the working of the Whitley Council system in determining salaries and conditions of service in the National Health Service. We will therefore set up an independent inquiry to make urgent recommendations for the improvement of the system. A Conservative government will back-date to last May the recommendations of the Halsbury Committee on the pay of nurses and related medical professions. But the problems on pay that have arisen in the National Health Service only underline the need for a policy to help workers throughout the public sector to be paid comparable rates of pay to those earned by workers in the private sector. This may mean channelling more money into wages and salaries, at the expense of buildings, if we are to avoid a total collapse of the National Health Service. In this way, for instance, we could implement the principal recommendations of the Briggs Report on nursing, while preserving the identity of the health visitor.  SPECIAL NEEDS There are additional areas requiring special help when the country can afford it. A Conservative government will give priority to services for old people, disabled people, mentally ill people, and mentally handicapped people, at home, in the community and in the hospital. We will build on the record of the last Conservative Government in providing improved services for deaf people, and continue to improve the rehabilitation services. We will take what action may be necessary, in the light of the Report on the death of Maria Colwell, to detect and prevent the ill-treatment of small children. We will improve the law relating to adoption following broadly the recommendations of the Houghton Report.  VOLUNTARY SOCIAL SERVICE In implementing our policy of identifying and meeting special need, we will continue to respect and help the voluntary organisations in their invaluable work. To this end, we will review the legal framework within which charities operate, a review that is long overdue. We will also develop the special unit that we set up when we were in government to help encourage voluntary service throughout the community.  Women - at home and at work  CHILD CREDITS FOR MOTHERS Among those worst hit by the ravages of inflation are mothers, whose house-keeping money often fails to keep pace with the higher prices in the shops. Housewives will therefore stand to gain most from the success of our price stabilisation programme. In addition, as we have already said, we plan as part of our tax credit scheme to introduce new child credits for all children, including the first. These will be worth more than the existing family allowances and will be payable to mothers in cash at the Post Office.  WOMEN AT WORK The last Conservative government took steps to ensure the effective implementation of Equal Pay for women at work by the end of 1975.  We stand by the principle of equal pay for women.  WOMEN IN RETIREMENT Women have had a rough deal over pensions from the present government, which has abandoned the last Conservative government's Second Pension Scheme. One of the purposes of this scheme was to improve greatly the pension prospects for women in employment - enabling many of them to earn a second pension for the first time and to get a second widow's pension, also for the first time. A Conservative government will reintroduce the scheme. We will also maintain the right of women not to pay the full contribution to the basic State scheme, and retired women who want to do part-time jobs will of course greatly benefit from our eventual abolition of the earnings rule.  WIDOWS In relation to supplementary benefit, we also intend, as we have said, to relax the earnings rule so as to enable widows to make a real contribution to the living standards of their families. Widows, as well as separated and deserted wives, with children to bring up, will benefit from the action we take in the light of the Finer Report.  THE RIGHT OF A WOMAN TO BE TREATED EQUALLY The last Conservative government made considerable progress in strengthening women's rights. In pensions, social benefits, taxation, maintenance payments and guardianship of children, we introduced a succession of new rights for women. We also announced our intention to set up an Equal Opportunities Commission, the biggest single step towards a society of real equality for men and women taken by any government since women won the vote. Only the timing of the election prevented its implementation. We remain committed to setting up an Equal Opportunities Commission with powers to enquire into areas of discrimination and to report to the Government on the need for future action.  Children, parents and schools  THE QUALITY OF EDUCATION Many parents are deeply worried about the quality of the education which THEIR children receive - in particular about standards of learning, conduct and discipline. These problems have accumulated over the years in an atmosphere over-charged with politics. Too often, the debate over education has centred on the kind of school rather than on the quality of the education provided; and too few parents have been allowed any real say over their children's education.  CHILDREN'S NEEDS MUST COME FIRST The Conservative approach towards education is clear and distinct. OUR OVERRIDING CONCERN IS WITH THE EDUCATIONAL NEEDS OF THE CHILDREN. Our first objective will therefore be to preserve good schools of whatever kind. We are in no way against comprehensive schools: what we oppose is the ruthless imposition of these schools, regardless of local needs and in defiance of parents' wishes. Typical of this approach is Labour's circular, which hits the building programmes of local authorities which have not gone comprehensive. The next Conservative government will withdraw this. We will expect local authorities to make their schemes of reorganisation sufficiently flexible to include grammar and direct grant schools of proven worth. This will help to meet the needs of bright and able children, especially those from disadvantaged areas. We will scrutinise zoning arrangements to ensure that they do not restrict or eliminate choice.  The eleven-plus examination is arbitrary. But selection where necessary must be flexible so as to allow the transfer of children from one school to another at a variety of ages.  RAISING STANDARDS WE MUST TAKE SPEEDY ACTION TO RAISE STANDARDS OF TEACHING AND EDUCATION. THIS WILL INVOLVE A CONSIDERABLE STRENGTHENING OF THE SYSTEM OF SCHOOLS INSPECTION. MORE INSPECTORS WILL NEED TO BE RECRUITED. NATIONAL STANDARDS OF READING, WRITING AND ARITHMETIC WILL BE SET. AND THE TRAINING PERIOD FOR TEACHERS SHOULD GIVE MORE ATTENTION TO TEACHING THE THREE BASIC SKILLS AND HOW TO MAINTAIN DISCIPLINE.  COMPREHENSIVE SCHOOLS Comprehensive schools have been a continuing source of controversy. This controversy should be settled by a fair and dispassionate examination of their performance, their size and their structure. A Conservative government will set up such an enquiry, as a matter of urgency, to report speedily.  DIRECT GRANT SCHOOLS The direct grant schools are particularly valuable. They combine high academic standards with a wide social mix. The present government is currently examining ways of destroying these schools. A Conservative government will instead strengthen them by re-opening the direct grant list, by considering the introduction of a complete system of assisted places so that every parent pays only according to his or her means, and-when economic circumstances allow us to do so - by raising the capitation grants to take account of increased costs.  THE SCHOOL-LEAVING AGE Since the raising of the school-leaving age, the problems of truancy and indiscipline have become more acute. We remain committed to the principle of education up to sixteen, but believe that it should be applied more flexibly. One possibility, which we will want to examine closely, is to allow children of fifteen the opportunity of taking up an apprenticeship or training as a first step towards taking a job.  A CHARTER OF PARENTS' RIGHTS AN IMPORTANT PART OF THE DISTINCT CONSERVATIVE POLICY ON EDUCATION IS TO RECOGNISE PARENTAL RIGHTS. A SAY IN HOW THEIR CHILDREN ARE TO BE BROUGHT UP IS AN ESSENTIAL INGREDIENT IN THE PARENTAL ROLE. WE WILL THEREFORE INTRODUCE ADDITIONAL RIGHTS FOR PARENTS. First, by amending the 1944 Education Act, we will impose clear obligations on the State and local authorities to take account of the wishes of parents. Second, we will consider establishing a local appeal system for parents dissatisfied with the allotment of schools. Third, parents will be given the right to be represented on school boards-by requiring a substantial proportion of the school governors and managers to be drawn from, and elected by, the parents of children currently at school. Fourth, we will place an obligation on all head teachers to form a parent-teachers association to assist and support teachers. Fifth, we will encourage schools to publish prospectuses about their record, existing character, specialities and objectives.  TEACHERS Better standards in schools will mean raising the status of the teaching profession. We will consider sympathetically the recommendations of Lord Houghton's Committee on Teachers' Salaries. As steps towards raising the professional status of teachers, we will encourage the movement to an all graduate profession, the implementation of the recommendations of the James Report on In-service Training and the establishment of a professional council for teachers to regulate their own affairs. We will also stimulate local authorities to provide houses for teachers where this is necessary.  TASKS FOR THE FUTURE For the moment, we cannot afford as a country to do all the things we want for children and young people - in their schools, colleges and universities. But when we have got on top of our present economic difficulties we will complete the work we have started for the younger children-replacing and modernising old primary schools (especially in the rundown areas of our towns and cities), developing further the pre-school facilities for children, and helping handicapped children. We will also want to ease the financial problems faced by our universities and see that teachers in polytechnics, with the same qualifications as those at universities, receive the same salaries. In addition our aim will be to finance the polytechnics and colleges of education in a similar way to the universities.  Young people  Young people want many of the same things as their parents-a decent home to start married life in, the opportunity to earn a rising standard of living, a fair reward for what they do, a decent environment, the chance to go as far as their abilities will take them. But the problems that are special to young people are not being adequately dealt with by central and local government.  THE NEED FOR CO-ORDINATION We therefore think that it is time to establish a special unit to co-ordinate the actions of government departments as they affect the needs and aspirations of young people.  YOUTH AND COMMUNITY BILL We will re-introduce the Youth and Community Bill, which, among other things, provides local reviews of existing arrangements in the field of housing, employment, leisure and advice services as they relate to young people.  HOUSING We will give special help to first-time house buyers as we have said in more detail earlier. We should also recognise that young people working in our cities are more mobile and have a special housing need which has been aggravated by the actions of the present government in introducing the Rent Act. We will encourage the voluntary housing movement to provide accommodation in inner city areas which will meet their needs. We will also encourage the growth of hostel accommodation and student co-operative dwellings. Local authorities should consider the needs of young people in planning their housing provision.  EMPLOYMENT The youth employment service has over the years provided invaluable help to thousands of school leavers. But too many young people still receive inadequate guidance in choosing their first job and insufficient help with the difficult move from school to work. We will accordingly undertake a review of the youth employment service in order to strengthen it and make it even more responsive to the needs of young people. We will also examine ways of improving the co-ordination of vocational guidance services in general, including the Manpower Services Commission, the adult occupational guidance unit, and the careers service profession. We want to see more young people in their last year at school given the opportunity to try out prospective jobs with the help and participation of local industries. For those in need of special help and support we will expand the Community Industries Scheme.  COMMUNITY SERVICE Most young people wish to have a greater say in the decisions affecting their lives, and many also wish to give service to the community. It is important to see that they are given opportunities to serve on bodies which influence daily life, particularly where the Government itself makes the appointments.  The young in urban communities are subject to special stresses. Those with immigrant parents may have additional problems because of the cultural differences between their family life and the society they live in. We will use the urban aid and community development programmes to support cooperative schemes, involving local authorities, voluntary agencies and the communities themselves.  STUDENTS When we review student grants, we will reduce the amount that parents have to contribute and we will end the discrimination against married women students. It is unfair that, while some students can get a grant as of right from a local authority, other students only get a grant if the local authority chooses to give one. As soon as economic circumstances allow, we will review the present arrangements with the aim of ending these unfairnesses in the provision of grants. We will encourage the formation of student housing associations.  People and their environment  For some unfortunate people environment means the slum they live in or the slag heap which looms at the bottom of their garden. For others it means stricter controls over pollution or conserving the world's finite resources; clearing more derelict land or encouraging family planning; giving more people the chance to go to concerts and galleries or raising the quality of broadcasting. The term covers a whole complex of questions which in one way or another affect the quality of our lives. Our approach to these problems as Conservatives is based on our belief that many things _should_ be conserved, and on our belief in the dignity of the individual. We do not accept that, by becoming more prosperous, we will destroy the quality of our environment. We believe, to the contrary, that properly controlled and directed growth can and will improve the environment, not least of those who at present have too low a standard of living to enjoy many of the good things of life.  BUILDING ON OUR RECORD In 1970 we set up the first Department of the Environment in the world and became world leaders in a policy to protect the environment when it was good and to improve it when it had been spoilt or polluted. We will build on our record by:  -   leading a determined, properly co-ordinated effort on a national       scale to make far greater progress in the recycling of waste       products;  -   carrying through the drive to clear derelict land;  -   pressing on with measures to prevent pollution of all kinds, and       improving the methods for monitoring potentially dangerous matter;  -   seeking methods of avoiding waste and unnecessary consumption of       fuels and energy, for example, by helping to raise the standards       of house insulation.  FAMILY PLANNING The last Conservative government appointed the Population Panel and for the first time provided a complete family planning service within the National Health Service. We believe that it is the responsibility of government to provide such a service and to tell people the facts about our population. But we must leave it to every family to decide what use to make of the family planning service.  TRANSPORT We want to preserve a proper balance between the interests of road and rail transport and between those of the private motorists and public transport. We will re-introduce our plans to modify the bus licensing system so as to give greater freedom for new forms of local transport in country areas. We will also extend the establishment of a system of lorry routes to keep heavy vehicles out of towns and villages and away from narrow country lanes. We will naturally continue to take all possible steps to diminish noise and other nuisances caused by new roads and the traffic which uses them, and also to improve road safety wherever possible.  TOWNS AND CITIES There are still parts of Britain, especially the inner city areas, which suffer acute squalor and deprivation-poor housing, dilapidated schools, substandard social and welfare services and a general lack of amenities. It is not surprising that these conditions have led to an increase in juvenile crime and vandalism.  What is needed is a major concentration of help in these areas, brought together in an effectively co-ordinated programme. We will first ask local authorities, in consultation with voluntary organisations, to propose Social Priority Areas. Our aim will then be to bring about a major transformation in these areas, by improving housing conditions, replacing or improving out-dated schools and building up the local social services and amenities. We will give more opportunity for local people to play a greater part in the affairs of their community. In particular we will make sure that more tenants are involved in running their council estates.  ADVICE CENTRES People are frequently unaware of their rights as citizens. They often find themselves being passed from one office to another receiving only discouragement. To help meet this problem we will set up advice centres, in partnership with the independent voluntary agencies which are already making a useful contribution.  BETTER RACE RELATIONS In many urban areas, in particular, social harmony depends on the white and the coloured communities living and working together on equal terms and with equal opportunities. A Conservative government will pursue positive policies to promote good race relations. This means, among other things, seeking remedies for the problems faced by coloured people, especially adolescents, in employment and in education (for example, in the teaching of the English language). The Government must take the lead and set an example, but local authorities, employers, trade unionists and voluntary organisations have an important part to play.  STRICT IMMIGRATION CONTROL Better community relations, however, depend also on reassuring people that immigration is being kept down to the minimum. In the interests of good race relations, and for the benefit of immigrants already in Britain, as well as for the wider community, a Conservative government will follow a policy of strictly limited immigration. Abuse of immigration control is unfair, particularly to immigrants who have arrived lawfully. While honouring commitments already made, we will discuss with the representatives of the immigrant communities steps to be taken against abuse. In all our policies our aim will be to keep in the closest touch with the immigrant communities.  NATIONALITY LAW We shall carry forward the review of British nationality law. Dependent on its outcome, new legislation may be required in the life of the next Parliament.  THE ARTS, SPORT AND BROADCASTING At a time when economic conditions necessarily impose limits on public spending, we will nevertheless continue to give as much help as we can to the arts, to sport and to broadcasting, and we will be particularly keen to encourage local effort and involvement. As we have promised before, we will introduce legislation to establish a Public Lending Right for authors.  People in Scotland and Wales  A recurring theme in our programme is the need to recognise that people want more freedom and more control over their own lives. This is what has shaped our policies for Scotland and Wales.  IN SCOTLAND WE WILL:  -   set up a Scottish Assembly;  -   give the Secretary of State for Scotland, acting with the Scottish       Assembly, the power to decide how to spend Scotland's share of the       UK budget;  -   establish a Scottish Development Fund, as stated earlier, to provide       substantial help with both the new problems created by oil, and       with Scotland's old deprived areas;  -   transfer the Oil Division of the Department of Energy to Scotland.  IN WALES, WE WILL:  -   increase the powers and the functions of the Secretary of State for       Wales and ensure that Wales' share of the UK budget is spent in       accordance with decisions taken in Wales and the Welsh Office;  -   establish a new Select Committee of Welsh MPs entitled to meet in       Cardiff as well as at Westminster;  -   strengthen the functions of the Welsh Council and reconstitute its       membership so that the majority will be elected from the new       County and District Councils.  In Scotland and Wales we are publishing separate manifestos, setting out these plans and others in more detail.  People in Northern Ireland  Our troops are still heavily engaged in Northern Ireland. They have carried out their difficult and dangerous task with superb courage, discipline, and skill. No other body of men in the world could have done so well. But the more police duties can be carried out by the police, the more we can reduce the strain on the Army, and the more soldiers we can withdraw from Ulster.  Yet it would be fatal to withdraw the Army before its work is done. And while our troops are risking their lives, they must have the support of the necessary emergency powers.  We recognise that Ulster is at present under-represented at Westminster, but obviously any change in that representation must await an agreement on the future devolution of government in Northern Ireland.  The next Conservative government, like the last, will work for peace and consent in Northern Ireland. There can be no military solution without a political solution that is fair to both the majority and the minority communities. Equally there can be no political solution unless terrorism is curbed and the law is respected and upheld by all. There must be partnership between the communities. We will seek the closest co-operation with the Republic, but Ulster is, of course, part of the United Kingdom.  People and the law  THE LAW UNDER ATTACK Through the centuries, the law in Britain has acted as the defence of the small man against the great, of the weak against the strong. If we cannot depend on the protection of the law, enacted by the free Parliament of a free people and enforced impartially between one man and another, then our security and our freedoms alike are without foundation. In a world of growing turbulence, individuals more than ever need the law's protection against the might of the powerful and irresponsible. But recently the law has been under attack, and those attacks have all too often been condoned and even endorsed by members and supporters of the present Government. Respect for the law cannot be selective. AT A TIME WHEN THERE ARE TOO MANY PEOPLE PREPARED TO TAKE THE LAW INTO THEIR OWN HANDS, A CONSERVATIVE GOVERNMENT, BACKED BY PUBLIC OPINION, WILL UPHOLD THE RULE OF LAW. WITHOUT LAW, THERE CAN BE NO FREEDOM.  STRENGTHENING THE POLICE We will need to take vigorous action to deal with the lawlessness and the growth of terrorism which confront us in the 1970s. THE NEW CONSERVATIVE GOVERNMENT WILL STRENGTHEN THE POLICE FORCE, OUR PRINCIPAL DEFENDERS AGAINST INTERNAL ATTACK. We will improve the career prospects throughout the whole police service, to provide greater incentives for policemen to remain in the force until retirement. We will launch a new recruitment drive to increase the numbers of Special Constables who can play an invaluable role in supporting the regular police. We support the introduction of an independent element into the procedure for investigating complaints against the police.  YOUNG OFFENDERS A strengthened police force will be in the forefront of the continuing battle against crime. But additional measures are needed to tackle the growth in crime committed by young persons, especially in our towns and cities. The Children and Young Persons Act of 1969 is now in need of review and amendment. The courts must be enabled to deal more effectively with persistent juvenile offenders-for example, football hooligans-and the range of available institutions must be improved. We need more community homes providing both secure accommodation and an environment for encouraging young offenders to become useful members of the community. All these steps will help to prevent today's young apprentices in crime from becoming tomorrow's professional criminals.  CRIME PREVENTION AT THE ROOTS A Conservative government will review fines, taking account of the change in the value of money and of trends in sentencing. We will pursue the policy we started of dealing with offenders in the community when it is both possible and sensible to do so. Our programme for channelling additional help and resources into the deprived areas of our cities and towns will also, by creating a better environment, play a valuable part in combating crime at the roots. We will further strengthen and expand the probation service.  PROCESSIONS AND DEMONSTRATIONS We will review the Public Order Act 1936 to ensure that it is adequate for the control of processions and demonstrations.  PROTECTING PEOPLE FROM INDECENT DISPLAY The growing display of indecent material in public places gives offence to many people. Accordingly, we will reintroduce our Bill to prohibit this and to tighten up the law against sending through the post unsolicited matter of an indecent nature.  REDRESS AGAINST OFFICIALDOM In the complex and powerful modern State, control 0£ administrative decisions that can adversely affect the individual has become increasingly important. There have been some valuable recent developments in Britain such as the spread of the Ombudsman system. But we believe our legal structure still needs further reform in order to strengthen its power to defend the citizen aggrieved by the State. We will pursue reform of administrative law in the light of our experience of the extended Ombudsman system and of the forthcoming proposals of the Law Commission.  LAW REFORM The framework of freedom and civilised life is the law. All our daily activities are dependent on it. We propose to give a high priority to keeping the law clear and up to date. Law reform may seem a dull subject but it does affect the rights of all of us. Here are some examples of needed reforms.  NEEDED REFORMS Our extradition laws, based on a century-old statute, are cumbersome, out of date, and in some conditions unworkable. We also need to reform the licensing laws taking into account public reactions to the Erroll Report. The law on compensation for personal injury needs attention and is at the moment being studied by a Royal Commission. The law affecting 'squatters' has been shown to be inadequate. Finally the drafting of our laws frequently lacks clarity, and this means that they are inaccessible and are difficult to interpret. We propose to secure greater simplicity and clarity in statute law in the light of the forthcoming report of the Renton Committee on the Preparation of Legislation.  IMPROVING JUSTICE When in office we substantially improved the machinery of justice. We will continue to do so and will review the machinery and jurisdiction of Magistrates' Courts in the light of the forthcoming James Report. When the economic situation permits, we favour the phased extension of Legal Aid to proceedings before Tribunals on certain defined principles.  PRIVACY AND OFFICIAL SECRETS When in office we implemented some of the Younger Report's recommendations on privacy (for example, on the secrecy of people's credit ratings) and were working on further aspects of it. We were also working on the security implications of the Franks Report. When returned to office, we will take up the unfinished work and present the country with further firm proposals.  SPEAKER'S CONFERENCE ON ELECTORAL REFORM In a democracy, it is essential that Parliament and our parliamentary institutions should enjoy the confidence of the people. That is why, for example, we have brought forward plans for giving people in Scotland and Wales a greater say in running their own affairs.  But confidence in Parliament has been strained by two developments. First, there have been the attempts by industrial monopolies and others to do as they want, regardless of the democratically expressed will of the people, and of the actions of a democratically elected government. Second, there have been those who have questioned whether our electoral system ensures that Parliament and the legislation it passes reflect the wishes of the people. We will propose the establishment of a Speaker's Conference to examine our electoral system and to make recommendations. In addition to considering our present voting system and alternatives, we would like the Speaker's Conference to examine the question of representation in the European Parliament, which many people think should be decided by direct election.  The British people and the world  DEFENDING BRITAIN We live in dangerous times. As much as in the past Britain must be able to defend herself and her way of life. To us, aggressive war may be unthinkable. To some other countries, it is an acceptable way of gaining their ends. Now we face the ever increasing danger of both national and international terrorism. In these circumstances the national interest demands the maintenance of adequate defence forces. Moreover, we must take all necessary steps to protect our energy supplies in the North Sea.  THE NATO ALLIANCE Throughout the last few years the Soviet armed forces in the West have continued to grow and there has been a vast expansion of the Russian navy. Unquestionably the NATO alliance, which has provided peace in Europe for 25 years, remains crucial to our security, and so the Conservative Party believes that Britain should continue to play a leading role within the alliance. We shall see that Britain's nuclear deterrent remains effective.  EFFICIENCY AND MORALE The efficiency and high morale of the armed forces, which has been so outstandingly demonstrated in Northern Ireland is of paramount importance. We must improve conditions of service for those who make the defence of this country their career. We will take action to tackle the difficulties which have arisen in the provision of housing for servicemen at the completion of their regular service. We will maintain the efficiency and improve the equipment of the Reserve Forces which play a vital role in the preservation of Britain's security.  BRITAIN AND THE WORLD Conservative foreign policy has always had two main objectives: first, to maintain the security of Britain and the protection of British interests; and, secondly, playing our full part in the Commonwealth, to gain as many friends and allies in the international community as possible. Such a policy contributes to stability throughout the world. It also creates the necessary conditions for the expansion of our trade.  CONSERVATIVE ACHIEVEMENTS IN FOREIGN POLICY The last Conservative government helped to strengthen NATO, but we also promoted the process of détente. We played a leading part in the Conference of Security and Co-operation in Europe. We opened Ministerial talks with the Peoples' Republic of China. We greatly improved our relations with the countries of the Middle East and the Persian Gulf.  THE COMMON MARKET But by far the most historic achievement of the last Conservative government was to bring about British entry into the European Community. Membership of the EEC brings us great economic advantages, but the European Community is not a matter of accountancy. There are two basic ideas behind the formation of the Common Market; first, that having nearly destroyed themselves by two great European civil wars, the European nations should make a similar war impossible in future; and, secondly, that only through unity could the Western European nations recover control over their destiny - a control which they had lost after two wars, the division of Europe and the rise of the United States and the Soviet Union.  All recent governments of this country have concluded that membership of the community is essential for British interests. These decisions were not lightly taken. They were preceded by prolonged study of the facts. The terms secured by the last Conservative government were supported by those members of the previous Labour government most qualified to judge them. The country's long term interests should not now be sacrificed to short term party interests.  THE DANGERS OF WITHDRAWAL An overwhelming majority of British exporters and businessmen favour our membership of the Common Market. The Community provides an enormous home market for our industries and membership of the biggest trading bloc in the world. Just as we need military allies, so we need political and economic allies. British withdrawal would mean the abandonment of export opportunities, the decline of industrial development in this country and the loss of jobs. Withdrawal would give us less power and influence in the world not more. Withdrawal would confront us with the choice of almost total dependence on others or retreat into weak isolation. We reject such a bleak and impotent future for Britain.  NEGOTIATION Within the Community, there is a continuous process of negotiation in order to take account of the interests of Britain and to deal with the problems of the community as a whole. This process will go on: it ensures that no member state carries an unfair burden. We will present the results of negotiation to Parliament at every stage in accordance with Britain's constitutional practice.  Conservatives have been playing their full part in the European Parliament to protect British interests, improve Community policy and make Europe more democratic. A central part of future Conservative policy will be to work realistically for closer European unity in all the areas of Community policy which can be of benefit to Britain. In this way we can make our contribution to a peaceful, prosperous and democratic Europe.  Europe gives us the opportunity to reverse our political and economic decline. It may be our last. "
"Labour",197905,"'The Labour Way is the Better Way'  FOREWARD:  Now, more than ever, we need Labour's traditional values of cooperation, social justice, and fairness. This manifesto restates these Labour principles in an action programme with a strong sense of the future. They appeal to all our people - young and old.  The world is changing rapidly. New industrial nations are rising to challenge our key industries on which British jobs and living standards depend.  The Labour Government is taking firm action to equip Britain to adapt to these changes and to seize new opportunities. And we will take great care to protect working people and their families from the hardships of change.  But although the 1980s will present a tough challenge, this country will have many things in our favour. North Sea oil offers a golden prospect as do our reserves of natural gas and coal. We must use these resources wisely to plan our future to create new wealth, new jobs, and to look after the family, the elderly, and those in need.  Too much is at stake to let the Conservatives frustrate the hopes of the coming decade by turning back the clock to the policies that they tried in the early seventies and that failed so badly before.  The Government's industrial strategy is about how to create more wealth and more jobs through a constructive national partnership with unions and management. The Conservatives will not admit that nowadays governments must step in to help create employment, to limit prices rises, to assist industry to modernize itself. They are ready to gamble the people's future on a return to the nineteenth century free market' - despite its pitiless social consequences. They are as dangerously out of their time as a penny farthing on the motorway.  Together the people and the Labour Government, even without a parliamentary majority, have achieved much these past five years, as the manifesto shows. In an uncertain world suffering the worst economic trouble for 40 years we have pointed the way forward.  But nobody who cares about Britain can rest satisfied until far, far more has been accomplished. As long as there are men and women struggling with low pay, mothers stretching the household budget to make ends meet, youngsters in search of a job, children learning in out of date classrooms, patients queuing for a hospital bed or families without a decent home - then there is work for a Labour Government.  Our purpose is to overcome the evils of inequality, poverty, racial bigotry, and make Britain truly one nation.  For these we need a Labour majority in Parliament. This manifesto sets out our aims for the next five years. Here are five of our priorities.  1. We must keep a curb on inflation and prices. Inflation is our enemy because rising prices hit most hardly at the pensioner, the low paid and the housewife, and inflation causes loss of jobs. Labour has brought inflation down from the alarming level caused by the Conservatives' failure to control the supply of money.  Now we set ourselves the task of bringing inflation down to 5 per cent in three years. It is an ambitious target. We need the assistance of everyone. And everyone will be better off if we succeed.  2. We will carry forward the task of putting into practice the new framework to improve industrial relations that we have hammered out with the TUC. The first step has been the creation of a new standing pay commission which will prevent the disruption of services to the public in future.  Next, each year there will be three-way talks between ministers, management and unions to consider the best way forward for our country's economy. Germany's Social Democratic Government under Willy Brandt and Helmut Schmidt has proved that this is a good way to reach agreement on how to expand output, incomes and living standards.  I am realistic enough to know that there are bound to be set backs. But experience reinforces what all of us know in our hearts - there is no sound alternative to working together.  A Conservative free-for-all in pay and prices would mean endless pitched battles that would be fatal to the interests of all of us. The Labour way is the better way.  3. We give a high priority to working for a return to full employment. A good job is a basic human right. During the last five years we have responded to the worldwide unemployment crisis by helping more than one million people to take up new jobs or new training.  Now we will concentrate special attention on more jobs and training for the regions, the young and the long-term unemployed, and give them hope for the future.  4. We are deeply concerned to enlarge people's freedom. Our policy will be to tilt the balance of power back to the individual and the neighbourhood, and away from the bureaucrats of town hall, company board room, the health service and Whitehall.  Industrial democracy - giving working men and women a voice in the decisions which affect their jobs - is an idea whose time has come. Council tenants will have more freedom from bureaucratic control in their own homes. Parents and teachers will have a greater freedom to influence the running of their children's schools. Whitehall will devolve power, in an acceptable form to Scotland. Local services will be handed back to local authorities closer to the people. These are practical ways to set the people free.  5. We will use Britain's influence to strengthen world peace and defeat world poverty. Europe has been at peace for over 30 years but ours is still a dangerous world with more armaments than ever before. Labour will keep Britain strong but we will also work hard for disarmament. It cannot be right that 15 million children in poorer countries die before they are five - yet the world spends so much on the means of destruction. There is a compelling moral need to raise the standard of life of all the world's citizens - no matter where they live.  We are ready and willing to work with our European partners in closer unity. But we must record that in some aspects of its work the Common Market lacks common sense.  Above all the agricultural policy is wasteful and expensive. In standing squarely against the discredited aspects of the dear-food policy, we are in fact defending the interests of European families just as much as British families. A nonsense is a nonsense in any language.  The Labour Government will give a strong lead in the decade ahead. But no government can do it all. Our purpose is to deepen the sense of unity and kinship and community feeling that has always marked out our fellow countrymen and women. No nation can succeed by accepting benefits without responsibilities. I ask everybody who shares our ideals and our faith in Britain to join with us in securing the return of a government that dares to turn the dream of a caring society into practical action. And then work with us to complete the building of a Britain offering hope, social justice, and fairness to all.  _James Callaghan_  This election is about the Britain of tomorrow - the kind of country we want to live in, the kind of community we wish for our children. In choosing their government, the people will be deciding what values and ideals will guide the nation in the critical years ahead. In this manifesto, Labour puts forward its policies for the future. The Labour Party is a democratic socialist party and proud of it. Labour seeks to build a stronger and more prosperous Britain - and we are determined to see that all our people share fully in that prosperity. We want a Britain which is open and democratic and which puts fair earnings for working people and the needs of the under-privileged before the demands of private profit.  Over the past five years, the Labour Government have laid the foundations of a stronger economy.  When Labour came to govern, in March, 1974, Britain was facing the most dangerous crisis since the war. The Tory programme of confrontation and social injustice had brought the country almost to its knees. Unlit streets, unheated homes, shut-down factories - these were the fruits of the Tory three-day week. We were £1,000m in deficit in our national balance of payments, even before the rising oil prices. Prices were soaring month by month. Industry was enfeebled by years of under-investment. To top it all, Britain then had to contend with the four-fold rises in oil prices and the worldwide inflation and unemployment.  Our inheritance was a Britain in crisis. The new Labour Government sought cooperation in place of confrontation. Instead of division, we offered social justice. In place of compulsion, we worked to win consent for the tough economic measures we knew were needed. We forged a new partnership between the Labour Government and working people.  Our country has come a long way since then. The rate of inflation has been brought under control. It has become possible to improve living standards, to cut taxation and increase child benefit, pensions and benefits to the disabled to rates which more than overtake costs and inflation.  And over the past year, unemployment has at last begun to fall. Now we offer a programme to carry Britain through the 1980s.  THE FIGHT AGAINST RISING PRICES  Nothing so undermines a nation as inflation. Not only does it make the family's task of budgeting more difficult, it is a threat to jobs and a standing invitation to our overseas competitors to invade our markets.  Now, with the renewed cooperation of the trade union movement, Labour will continue the battle against rising prices. With the wholehearted backing of the TUC, we have set ourselves a new target, to get inflation down to 5 per cent by 1982.  Our approach will be threefold:  Firstly, Labour will strengthen the Price Commission, giving it greater powers to initiate investigations and reduce prices, in contrast to the Tories who threaten its abolition. We will expand its powers to combine its functions with those of the Monopolies and Mergers Commission to ensure that consumers are not exploited by monopoly producers or unfair practices. We will further strengthen and extend consumer protection, in both the public and private sectors.  Secondly, Labour will seek radical reform of the Common Market's common agricultural policy, and will oppose any further increases in common prices until food surpluses have disappeared.  Thirdly, in contrast to the Tories' savage free-for-all which leads to soaring inflation and industrial chaos, the Labour Government will work with the TUC to achieve our agreed inflation target of 5 per cent in 1982. The Labour Government and the TUC have jointly agreed to set up a standing commission on comparability which will ensure that public sector workers, including those who are low-paid, receive fair wages that are in line with those paid in the private sector.  For the private sector, we declare our aim to be a high wage, high productivity, low unit cost economy. To this end, we pledge ourselves to make a reality of fair deal collective bargaining, in keeping with the criteria set down in the joint statement.  This agreement is a far better way of achieving industrial peace, prosperity and more stable prices than confrontation with the trade union movement.  Here is an agreement which can deliver industrial peace, fair wages, and greater price stability.  JOBS AND PROSPERITY  In the major industrial nations of Europe and America, 17 million people are out of work. In Britain alone we have to find jobs for 170,000 new workers every year.  The Labour Government will pursue policies which give a high priority to the return to full employment. This must go hand-in-hand with keeping down inflation. We therefore aim at a rate of growth of 3 per cent or more.  Our North Sea oil gives us an advantage in securing full employment and a rise in living standards. The new technologies also hold out the prospect of faster growth and a better quality of life for all. This is particularly true of microtechnologies (the silicon chip) which will have a major impact on the lives of everybody. Only a Labour Government can ensure that our people as a whole derive the benefit.  In order to take full advantage of these opportunities, we must improve our industrial competitiveness at home and abroad - and that means making sure our industries adapt to new markets and technological changes. It also means easing the costs of rapid industrial change for working people. The use of crude market forces advocated by the Tories will not and cannot achieve these changes in a way that is acceptable to the British people. What we need is a firm industrial and employment strategy from a Labour Government aimed at increasing productivity, adding to investment, and creating new jobs.  We shall expand and improve programmes of training and retraining in skills.  We shall expand the work and finance of the National Enterprise Board, using public ownership to sustain and create new jobs, and ensure that we get an adequate return on our investment.  We shall continue our strong policy of regional incentives.  We shall expand the work of the Welsh and the Scottish Development Agencies. The Labour Government will create similar development agencies in the English regions suffering similar problems.  To ensure that private industry plays its full part in the drive for prosperity and full employment, we shall conclude planning agreements with the major industrial companies, with the necessary back-up statutory powers to do so. We shall establish within Government the necessary arrangements to make this effective.  We reaffirm the policy that we have pursued that wherever we give direct aid to a company OUT of public funds, we shall reserve the right to take a proportionate share of the ownership of the company; and wherever possible, this public support will be channelled through the planning agreement system.  Labour will continue with major aids to investment, including the selective investment scheme which has already supported projects in excess of £1,000m.  Labour will develop the work and funding of the Cooperative Development Agency in expanding cooperative enterprise.  This is a positive strategy for industry, based on cooperation between Government, trade unions, and management. The new agreement between the Government and the TUC, which includes provision for an agreed annual assessment of the nation's economic prospects, lays the foundation for working together in the 1980s.  Labour will work for an international agreement under which all countries are helped and encouraged to expand their economies to the limit of their productive capacity and so stimulate world trade. This will help British exports to increase still faster. But to do this, Britain needs a healthy and expanding economy.  We also need a programme to protect employment while the necessary changes and modernization of our industry takes place. We will not allow our industries to be wiped out by excessive imports before they have had a chance to recover their strength. The Labour Government will ensure that imports enter our market only within acceptable limits.  Under the Labour Government, we shall continue with programmes like the short-time working compensation scheme, the job release scheme, the small firms employment subsidy, and job creation programmes which have already created and saved over one million jobs.  We do not accept that individuals whose jobs have disappeared should remain unemployed for periods of time which demoralise them and impoverish their families. We pledge ourselves to the progressive introduction of a scheme which will ensure within the lifetime of the next Parliament that no one shall be unemployed for more than 12 months without receiving either the offer of a job or of retraining.  Labour will also promote an expansion in housing, the health service, education and other social services which have such a crucial part to play in providing jobs as well as in meeting vital social needs.  If full employment is to be achieved, longer holidays, time off for study, earlier voluntary retirement, and a progressive move to a 35-hour working week, must play an increasing role during the 1980s. But these changes in the pattern of employment are not only necessary to keep jobs, but also to improve the quality of living for working people, to give them more leisure and the means to enjoy it to which their work and modern technology entitles them.  Labour must ensure that the financial institutions of this country play their part in our programme for the revival of industry. We acknowledge the many successes of the financial sector, but we are also concerned that the lure of short-term profit can outweigh the social gains to be had from industrial investment.  The banking sector would benefit from increased competition. We therefore intend to bring about a major development in the Girobank so that it will compete on equal terms with the big four clearing banks and improve standards of service to small savers. The National Savings Bank has a valuable role to play in providing a unique service and in making a significant contribution to financing the Government's operations, thus reducing our reliance on the City. By developing the Girobank and the National Savings Bank to their full potential, a Labour Government will ensure for the country a vigorous public banking sector.  AGRICULTURE AND FISHING  Agriculture has always flourished best under Labour Governments. We have already taken many steps to encourage production, while giving consumers and workers in the industry the best possible deal. Agricultural workers in tied cottages have been given security of tenure in England and Wales; we intend to do the same for Scotland.  Elsewhere we give our proposals to reform the EEC's common agricultural policy. There must also be a vigorous expansion of agriculture at home. Labour will:  Develop measures of special assistance to farmers on hill and marginal land.  Consider in the light of the official enquiry we have set up into agricultural land, protection for farmers against the intrusion of financial institutions into this field. Continue to demand a common fisheries policy that gives preference in our own waters to a strong British fishing industry - betrayed by the last Tory Government - with a secure future. We will continue to take, and enforce, national measures to conserve stocks. We shall complete the process of decasualisation in the industry.  ENERGY  The world energy situation is deteriorating. Energy policy is vitally important to our survival. We shall strengthen the democratic planning of the long-term developments of Britain's own energy sources, backed by the necessary powers, under full parliamentary control.  Britain is almost alone among major industrial nations in achieving energy self-sufficiency; our resources have been developed, thanks to the skills of our scientists and of the workers. The Tories handed over our oil wealth to the multinationals. We changed that and will ensure that this energy wealth is developed wisely for industrial regeneration and public provision, and its fruits distributed fairly.  We will continue to support Plan for Coal' for the mining industry, which has a key role to play in our energy future.  In any programme for nuclear power, safety must continue to be the dominant factor. Any such development would have to take place within the public sector. We shall maintain strict safeguards over the disposal of nuclear waste. We have not decided whether to build a commercial fast breeder reactor. A major study and public inquiry would be held before any decision were to be taken.  We shall progressively increase the national stake in the North Sea, to safeguard the British people and regenerate British industry.  We have initiated and will continue a major programme of alternative energy, energy saving, through insulation grants, advice to industry, the 'Save-It' campaign, and an energy-saving approach to transport.  We shall continue to help people to afford adequate light, heat, and power in their homes.  A FAIRER BRITAIN  Economic success is not an end in itself. For the Labour Party, prosperity and fairness march hand in hand on the road to a better Britain. During the next Parliament, we intend to continue our fight against all forms of social injustice.  The tax system must be fair and seen to be so. We will mount an all-out attack on tax evasion. Everybody must make their fair contribution to the country's finances. In the next Parliament, we shall introduce an annual wealth tax on the small minority of rich people whose total net personal wealth exceeds £150,000.  Labour will continue to reduce the burden of income tax, and raise the tax threshold below which people pay no income tax.  Despite the difficulties of the economic situation, Labour has kept its pledge to look after the poor and vulnerable in our society - pensioners, the sick or disabled people, and the unemployed. Pensions are up by 20 per cent in real terms on the Tory level. Labour's new child benefit gives £4 a week per child for every mother. Disabled people have new benefits: a non-contributory invalidity pension, an invalid car allowance, and a mobility allowance for people who cannot walk.  The Labour Government will build on our record of achievement. Labour will:  As a next step towards a married couple pension of half gross average earnings and a single person's pension of one-third gross average earnings, increase pensions in November to around £35 for a married couple and £22 for a single person. Widows', invalidity and other long-term benefits will be increased in line.  As a step towards meeting our objective that families get as much help for their children when working as they do on short-term benefits, increase child benefit to _£4.50_ in November as a next step towards further help.  Give further cash and other help to one-parent families. Raise the burial grant to a more realistic level.  For disabled people, Labour will:  Work for the further implementation of Labour's Chronically Sick and Disabled Persons Act.  Increase the mobility allowance again next November and continue to pay the mobility allowance beyond pension age without an upper age limit.  Introduce a new disablement allowance to include the blind, varying according to the severity of disablement.  A HEALTHIER NATION  The nation's health must have priority. We reject Tory plans to create two health services: one for the rich, financed by private insurance with a second-class service for the rest of us. Labour reaffirms its belief in a comprehensive national health service for all our people. We oppose Tory proposals for higher prescription charges and charges for seeing a doctor or being in hospital. Our aim is to abolish all charges in the NHS.  For all the talk of cuts, the truth is that the Labour Government are spending over £600m a year more on health in real terms than the Tories. Labour will devote a higher proportion of the nation's wealth to the health service and the personal social services.  Labour's health priorities include a renewed shift from hospital treatment to care in the community through family doctors and health centres with supporting social services; a comprehensive family planning service within the NHS; more emphasis on the prevention of illness and handicap; a fairer share of health funds across the country; more help for the frail elderly, the mentally ill, and handicapped; better training and opportunities for nurses and all workers in the health services; a new career structure for hospital doctors; and a greater recognition and reward to those consultants whose only professional commitment is to the NHS.  We will streamline the bureaucratic and costly structure the Tories created and give a bigger say in running the NHS to the public and staff.  We are phasing-out the remaining private beds in NHS hospitals. We shall stop queue-jumping.  EDUCATION  The Labour Party believes in equality of opportunity. Universal comprehensive education, which is central to our policy, must be completed in the 1980s. Already class sizes are the lowest ever recorded. The ratio of pupils to teachers is now only 23.6 in primary schools and 16.9 in secondary schools. Labour will continue to give high priority to reducing class sizes further.  Independent schools still represent a major obstacle to equality of opportunity. Labour's aim is to end, as soon as possible, fee-paying in such schools, while safeguarding schools for the handicapped. Labour will end as soon as possible the remaining public subsidies and public support to independent schools.  THE UNDER-FIVES  Under this Labour Government, the proportion of 3- and 4-year-olds in nursery classes and schools has doubled. Local authorities will be encouraged to do much more. Our aim is to provide nursery education for 90 per cent of our 4-year-olds and half of our 3-year-olds by the early 1980s.  THE NEEDS OF YOUTH  We will provide a universal scheme of education and training for all 16-19 year olds, if necessary backed by statute. We will remove the financial barriers which prevent many young people from low income families from continuing their education after 16.  We will reintroduce legislation for income-related mandatory awards to all 16-18 year olds on all full-time courses.  FURTHER AND HIGHER EDUCATION  Further education places have increased by 25,000 under Labour. Labour will substantially increase the opportunities for people from working-class backgrounds -particularly adults - to enter further and higher education. We want to see more workers given time off work for study. To this end, the places at the Open University have increased from 42,000 in 1974 to 80,000 in 1978. We propose to extend the present mandatory grant system. Labour supported the adult literacy scheme, and will ensure its continuation.  YOUTH  Britain has the best youth programme in Europe. We have the youth opportunities programme, which guarantees every school-leaver either a job or a training place or employment experience. We are supporting a great range of opportunities for young people. Labour will see the youth service expanded to meet the social and recreational needs of young people.  SPORT  In a society where leisure is increasing year by year, Labour wants to make facilities for sport and leisure available to all. We will continue to put more money into these activities.  HOMES FOR ALL  Over _1.5_ million homes have been completed since Labour took office. A further one million sub-standard or near slum houses have been substantially improved with Government finance, under the 1974 Housing Act. The homeless have had a new deal. And yet too many of our people still live in unacceptable housing conditions. We will continue a substantial programme of housebuilding and home improvement.  Under our new system of housing investment programmes, local councils will continue to play a central part in meeting housing needs.  We reject the philosophy that tenants are second-class citizens. Labour has already published its new Housing Bill which will give a new deal to council tenants to give them security of tenure; the right to a written tenancy agreement; the right to improve the home; the right to take in lodgers; the right to be consulted on housing management decisions; easier residential qualifications; and a new national scheme to help tenants to move from one part of the country to another.  We will improve the quality of our less popular council estates, which will mean relaxing the rules under which improvements to estates less than 30 years old cannot attract Government subsidy.  Labour does not oppose the sale of council houses to sitting tenants of two years' standing who want to buy, so long as such sales are at a fair price and do not damage a local authority's ability to meet the demands for decent homes to rent. But Labour will continue to oppose the sales of council housing in areas of serious housing need.  Labour also seeks to widen choice, and we shall therefore continue to help those who wish to buy their own homes.  Labour will:  Carry through its new home loan plan to give saving bonuses and interest-free loans of up to £600 to first-time buyers.  Examine ways of expanding the scheme under which building societies lend to home-buyers nominated by local councils, particularly for older, cheaper properties.  Introduce new ways of lowering the cost and speeding the process of house purchase. Labour has set up the Royal Commission on Legal Services, which will be reporting on conveyancing. Labour policy is to end the monopoly on house conveyancing now enjoyed by solicitors, and improve leasehold enfranchisement. With the growth of home ownership and council housing, private renting has  entered an irreversible decline. We stand by the principles of security of tenure and rent regulations, and will legislate to close loopholes in the Rent Acts. We shall continue to encourage socially-accountable landlords - local authorities, housing associations and housing cooperatives - to take over privately rented property except where an owner-occupier lets part of his own home.  Labour will give private tenants access to improvement grants on the same basis as owners. We shall make it easier for a tenant to force a landlord to do necessary repairs. We will legislate to give further protection to those who live in mobile homes and to the owners of holiday caravans. We will set up a new housing tribunal to replace the present confusing jumble of courts, tribunals and committees dealing with rents, security of tenure, and other housing problems.  Labour will give new rights to everyone whose home is tied to their job.  BUILDING AND OUR FUTURE  A well-organized and efficient construction industry is essential to the achievement of many of our economic and social objectives. Labour will:  Plan and coordinate public sector demand on the industry, in order to help stabilize the industry's workload.  Press forward with plans for decasualization and job security in the industry, building on the work of the Construction Industry Manpower Board, and giving their proposed registration scheme statutory backing if necessary.  Encourage the development of building workers' cooperatives.  Expand local authority direct labour organizations, ensuring that they are efficiently run as separate municipal enterprises, publicly accountable for their performance.  Develop and strengthen existing building capacity in the public sector so as to establish pace-making public enterprise for large and medium sized construction projects.  LABOUR AND THE LAND  At the heart of all planning policy is the problem of the land. Labour's Community Land Act provides the means to tackle land speculation through public ownership. We shall seek to clarify and amend the regulations surrounding land valuation, not least to ensure that land is valued very much more closely to its present use value. We shall use it to ensure that social criteria rather than maximum profit decides how land is to be used. We intend to set up a publicly accessible register of all land.  We will authorize local authorities to charge rates on land which is left unused. We have simplified planning procedures. We intend that in future planning permissions not acted upon after five years will not be automatically renewed.  THE INNER CITY  Labour is committed to save our inner cities. With the inner city partnerships, the new  Urban Area Act, and the increased urban programme, Labour has begun to breathe  new life into our inner cities.  First, we must bring back more jobs to these areas. Our national industrial policy will be used to bring investment to the inner cities. We will mount a concerted effort to stimulate the development of small firms and worker cooperatives in these areas.  Secondly, we will bring about during the lifetime of the next Parliament a further increase in the expenditure earmarked for refurbishing our inner cities, for education, for housing, and for the social services.  RURAL AREAS  The Labour Government will take measures to arrest the decline in the quality of life in rural areas. We will increase the funds available to the Development Commission, and widen its scope. We will reestablish the Rural Development Boards in England and ensure that the Co-operative Development Agency, the NEB, the tourist boards and the Manpower Services Commission play an active role in rural job creation. We shall encourage new forms of agriculture - such as fish farming.  Recognizing the importance of an adequate integrated rural transport service, we will provide greater support for rural buses, encourage improvements in the frequency and timetabling of conventional services, and open freight rail lines to passenger services.  We will improve and increase public sector housing in rural areas and improve their educational facilities and personal social services.  OUR ENVIRONMENT  Labour is proud of its record on environmental matters. Our Standing Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution has set the pace for advance. For the future, however, we will have to give still higher priority to this important issue.  Labour will:  Develop policies for resource conservation.  Use our campaign for a better environment to provide the basis of secured employment, eg in pollution control and in waste recycling.  Further reduce the lead content in petrol.  Provide an annual State of the Environment' report to Parliament. Ensure that, before the inquiry stage of major development proposals - perhaps two or three a year - the environmental effects are subject to detailed analysis and the report published.  Introduce an extended clean-up campaign - 'Making Britain Clean and Green', and start a real drive by local authorities and voluntary groups to clear up derelict land, and use it to the benefit of the community.  TRANSPORT  The majority of our people still depend on public transport. Labour believes in maintaining and improving within an integrated transport system. We will encourage closer coordination at local level between road and rail.  RAILWAYS  Under Labour, there will never be another Beeching. We will maintain the present rail network and increase investment in the future. As much freight as possible must be carried by rail; and the scheme whereby companies receive grants for installing railway facilities will be extended.  Buses, especially in country areas, will continue to require a permanent and substantial amount of public support to meet social needs. In areas where free travel does not yet exist, Labour will bring in a nationwide, off-peak, half-fares scheme for OAPs, the blind and the disabled.  We will sort out the present confusion surrounding arrangements for children's fares, so that there are free fares up to the age of five, and reduced fares up to 16. Those benefiting from the present free travel to school schemes will not be affected.  For the motorist, we want to reduce bureaucracy and ensure fair treatment. The phased abolition of vehicle excise duty will remove one source of annoyance and irritation. Labour will press for major improvements for customers in motorway service areas and garage repairs generally.  Heavy lorries will be made to carry, through taxation, their full share of road costs, including environmental costs. We will take further measures to reduce noise and pollution. The National Freight Corporation must be enabled to provide the basis for expanding the public sector in the road haulage industry. The Labour Government will continue to oppose any proposals to increase the permitted maximum weight limit for heavy lorries, which are inconsistent with road safety and the needs of the environment.  The road building programme will remain at its present level - but we will adopt a more selective approach than in the past. More by-passes will be built. Highway inquiries will also be more open, wider in scope, and with inspectors clearly seen to be independent.  In the ports industry, we reaffirm our policy to bring commercial ports and cargo handling into public ownership.  A WIDER, MORE OPEN DEMOCRACY  A central theme of our programme for the eighties is the protection and enhancement of  our democracy.  DEMOCRACY AT WORK  The time has come to recognize the increasing desire of employees to have a larger say in the decisions which vitally affect their working lives and jobs. We also wish to harness their energies and experience in a positive partnership to improve our industrial relationships in a way which reduced conflict and increased cooperation. We therefore commit the Labour Government to a major extension of industrial democracy. Democratic practice and good industrial relations means single status in industry and a dignified respect for all workers, whatever their plant grading.  We recognize - as have other countries - that employees should be entitled to fall back on certain basic rights if agreement is not achieved. To this end, we will encourage recognized trade unions to establish joint representation committees in all companies employing more than 500 people, and place a legal obligation on employers to discuss company plans with these committees. We will establish an industrial democracy commission to stimulate and monitor schemes of industrial democracy in the private sector and nationalised industries.  DEVOLUTION  In our 1974 manifesto, we promised to create elected assembles in Scotland and Wales as part of our programme of decentralization and devolution of power. Following the result of the referendum in Wales, it is clear that the majority there does not want an assembly, and we accept their decision. In Scotland, however, a majority voted for devolution.  We reaffirm our commitment to devolution for Scotland. We are therefore ready to discuss constructively with all concerned any changes which would make the scheme in the present Act more widely acceptable, so that we can establish a Scottish Assembly.  LAW, RIGHTS AND THE COMMUNITY  The protection and enhancement of human rights and civil liberties is an indispensable part of a wider democracy. We will fight against crime and violence which affect all Western societies. We will continue to back the police with proper resources and manpower. The police are substantially better-paid and equipped today than they were under the Tories. At the same time, we shall attack the social deprivation which allows crime to flourish.  Our policies on fighting deprivation and social injustice, on arresting the decay of our inner cities, on youth employment and helping the family, will all contribute to a happier and more law-abiding society.  During the next Parliament, we will increase law centres providing legal help for the ordinary citizen; provide more resources for the prison and probation services; extend legal aid to certain tribunal hearings; bring together and coordinate the various offices of Ombudsmen; consider responsibility for the conduct of prosecutions in the light of the report of the Royal Commission on Criminal Procedures; and provide further help for the victims of crime.  DEMOCRACY AT WESTMINSTER  In central government, we will:  Make major improvements in the legislative process, including new methods of considering Bills in committee, and of scrutinizing the work of government through select committees.  Establish a more powerful and professional system of audit.  Introduce a Freedom of Information Bill to provide a system of open government, and enact the proposals made by the Government in its White Paper to reform Section Two of the Official Secrets Act.  Bring forward proposals to reform the machinery of government and the structure of public administration to bring them into line with modern conditions.  Reexamine the procedures for appointment to governmental and quasi-governmental bodies, and to the boards of public enterprises, and for recommendations for honours.  No one can defend on any democratic grounds the House of Lords and the power and influence it exercises in our constitution. We propose, therefore, in the next Parliament, to abolish the delaying power and legislative veto of the House of Lords.  LOCAL DEMOCRACY  Already, the central government pays 61 per cent of the cost of most local services. We shall continue through the rate support grant to provide national Exchequer assistance to ratepayers, particularly in areas of greatest need. We shall seek ways of making finance for local government fairer to ratepayers.  Labour will extend public involvement in local government, so damaged by the bureaucratic and costly local government system imposed by the Tories.  To this end, the Labour Government will:  Give back to large district councils in England responsibility for education, planning, social services, local libraries and other local services.  EQUALITY FOR WOMEN  Labour's Sex Discrimination Act, Equal Pay Act, the Employment Protection Act, and  Social Security Pensions Act have already created a new deal for women.  Disabled housewives, single mothers, women looking after a dependent relative -all have received help from this Labour Government.  We have made a start towards equal citizenship by giving to British women, married to foreign husbands, the same rights as British men with foreign wives. We have changed the regulations to make it possible for children born abroad to British mothers to acquire British nationality.  We shall progressively eliminate the inequalities that still exist in the social security and tax systems. We shall introduce further reforms proposed by the Finer Committee on One-Parent Families. We have already protected the anonymity of women victims of rape. We shall bring in a fairer system of family law with new family courts. Labour will abolish the contributory conditions for maternity grant and raise the level of the grant.  ONE COMMUNITY  Labour has already strengthened the legislation protecting minorities. The next Labour  Government will continue to protect the community against discrimination and  racialism. We will:  Give a strong lead, by promoting equality of opportunities at work throughout the public sector.  Help those whose first language is not English.  Monitor all Government and local authority services to ensure that minorities are receiving fair treatment.  Consider what measures may be necessary to clarify the role of the Public Order Act and to strengthen and widen the scope of the Race Relations Act.  Review the 1824 Vagrancy Act, with a view to the repeal of Section 4.  Large-scale migration to this country is ending, but we still have some major commitments to fulfil. Labour will honour these. A quota would merely cause even longer delays for dependants.  Our whole immigration and citizenship law needs revision. Progress has already been made on this with the publication of a Government Green Paper.  NORTHERN IRELAND  For over four years, Labour has governed Northern Ireland direct from Westminster. During this period, considerable progress has been made on the security front and on the efforts to bring peace and stability to the Province. Detention has been ended, a special independent Police Complaints Board has been set up, and the police themselves are now more widely accepted in the community.  Unfortunately, in spite of all the attempts by the Labour Government, it has not been possible to find common agreement between the political parties on the best form of government for Northern Ireland.  For the present, direct rule remains the only viable alternative. Any change can be made only with the consent of the people of Northern Ireland. We will work to make it more accountable and democratic.  In the field of security, there is an essential role for the army in protecting the people of Northern Ireland, but we will continue our policy of extending the role of the police so as to involve all sections of the community.  We accept the recommendations of the Bennett Committee, and we will see that they are carried out as quickly as possible to make ill-treatment impossible.  Labour has saved thousands of jobs in Northern Ireland and attracted much investment and industry to the most under-developed areas. But at about twice the United Kingdom average, unemployment continues at an intolerably high level. The industrial policies set out earlier will be applied with full force and vigour to Northern Ireland.  THE ARTS AND THE MEDIA  Both the arts and the media play an important role in enhancing the quality of our democracy.  Arts. Aid to the Arts Council is going up 25 per cent this year. We will ensure more money for the Arts in future. The Arts Council should include elected representatives.  A Labour Government will set up a British Film Authority, with a distribution arm to stimulate investment in British film productions.  The media. Our aim is to safeguard freedom of expression; to encourage diversity; and to guard both against the dangers of government and of commercial control.  On broadcasting, the Labour Government will implement the proposals in its White Paper, including instituting an Open Broadcasting Authority. We will phase out the television licence fee for old age pensioners during the lifetime of the next Parliament.  ANIMAL WELFARE  Under Labour's new council of animal welfare, we will have stronger control on the export of live animals for slaughter, and conditions of factory farming, and experiments on living animals.  Legislation to end cruelty to animals will include the banning of hare coursing, stag and deer hunting. Angling and shooting will in no way be affected by our proposals.  EUROPEAN COMMUNITY  At this election, Labour will, once again, be the only major political party to offer the British people the prospect of bringing about fundamental and much-needed reform to the EEC.  We are concerned to ensure that Greece, Portugal, and Spain receive an early welcome into the Community. This enlargement of the Community will provide an opportunity to create a wider and looser grouping of European states, thus reducing the dangers of an over-centralised and over-bureaucratic EEC.  We aim to develop a Europe which is democratic and socialist, and where the interests of the people are placed above the interests of national and multinational capitalist groups, but within which each country must be able to realize its own economic and social objectives, under the sovereignty of its own Parliament and people.  A Labour Government will oppose any move towards turning the Community into a federation.  TRADE AND INDUSTRY  Working with our socialist colleagues, we will defend the ability of each member state to determine its own industrial policies. Our policy is to encourage such measures as import ceilings and orderly marketing arrangements where they are necessary to protect vital national economic interests.  Member states must be able to control and plan their own energy policies while at the same time maximizing cooperation and seeking agreement on areas of mutual interest, such as research and development.  FOOD AND AGRICULTURE  Membership of the Community has compelled us to pay more for our food than otherwise would be the case. The CAP raises serious problems for British agriculture -distorting the balance of production; decreasing consumption through inflated prices in the shops; and stopping the industry from growing. That is why Labour seeks a fundamental reform of the CAP.  The Tories back a policy which would raise food prices by the equivalent of £90 a year on the average family budget.  Labour will seek to:  End the scandal of food surpluses - which cost £900m per year in storage alone.  Improve access for cheap food from countries outside the EEC.  Reduce EEC support prices; and press for more scope under the CAP for national  support arrangements, such as our beef premiums.  A change in emphasis from price support to structural reform.  The reforms we are calling for are in the interests of consumers throughout every country in the Community. We will do our utmost to gain the cooperation of our EEC partners. However, if these reforms are not speedily implemented, we shall protect our interests - if necessary vetoing any further increase in food prices until surpluses have been eliminated.  ECONOMY AND FINANCE  We will retain the freedom to determine our own budgetary policy and to control our own currency. A Labour Government will retain the power to impose controls on capital movements and will continue to resist any upward harmonisation of VAT or any reduction in the existing range of zero-rated VAT items in Britain. A Labour Government would not join an economic and monetary union.  THE COMMUNITY BUDGET  Major reforms are needed to the Community Budget. Britain is now providing a net subsidy to some of the other EEC countries amounting to £900m a year. No country whose national income falls below the average for the Community as a whole should be required to make a net contribution to the Budget.  We should reduce the proportion (75 per cent) of the Community Budget spent on agriculture, and the funds so released could be directed into social and regional development.  The Labour Government will ensure that the Community Budget should promote a fairer distribution of resources within the EEC, and the convergence of economic performance of member states, to achieve faster growth, higher employment and lower rates of inflation.  PARLIAMENTARY SOVEREIGNTY  The Labour Government will legislate to ensure that British ministers are accountable to the House of Commons before making any commitment in the Council of Ministers. Enlargement of the Community will provide the opportunity for seeking changes in the Treaty of Rome, which would enable the House of Commons to strengthen its powers to amend or repeal EEC legislation. This would involve consequential amendments to the 1972 European Communities Act.  THE THIRD WORLD  The Labour Government will press for improvements in the Lome Convention, for widening the scope of the EEC's aid to include the most needy areas of the world, and for the EEC to place emphasis on trade and the stabilization of the export prices of third world commodities.  FOREIGN POLICY  The Labour Party's priority is to build a democratic socialist society in Britain and to create the conditions necessary to free the world from poverty, inequality and war. We condemn violations of human rights wherever they occur and whatever the political complexion of the Government concerned, and will further human rights in all international organizations.  Crucial to our policy is the pursuit of peace, development and disarmament by strengthening the process of détente. We shall seek to improve relations with the USSR and the countries of Eastern Europe, as well as with China.  We shall continue to work for the peaceful and just settlement of disputes and the strengthening of international cooperation. The Labour Government will, therefore, continue its policy of strengthening international organizations, particularly the United Nations, and the Commonwealth.  We shall continue to work to bring about a just settlement of the problems of Cyprus.  We shall work for a negotiated settlement of the Israeli-Arab conflict which would ensure the right of all parties to achieve national self-determination and to live in a homeland within secure and recognized borders.  Labour is totally opposed to the system of apartheid, and will continue to support opponents of apartheid, giving humanitarian and other aid to liberation movements of southern Africa. Labour believes that it is not only wrong, but contrary to British long-term interests, to be closely tied economically to South Africa. We will take active steps to reduce our economic dependence on South Africa and discourage new investment in South Africa by British companies. Those already operating there will be expected to comply with a strengthened code of conduct governing conditions of employment.  We have refused to approve the Rhodesian internal settlement and we will continue to work for a settlement of the Rhodesia problem acceptable to the people of Rhodesia as a whole. Until such time as an agreement is arrived at, we will maintain and intensify sanctions against the illegal regime.  We will continue actively to support the United Nations settlement proposals for Namibia, including upholding the territorial integrity of the country.  In respect of those countries of Latin America with dictatorial regimes, particularly Chile and Argentina, the Labour Government will demand that these regimes pay promptly their due debts. The restoration of human and trade union rights will be a prior condition for the rescheduling of future debt payments.  We will continue to pursue our policy of aid to the poorest countries and the poorest people, with the emphasis on rural development. Under Labour, aid is increasing at 6 per cent a year.  We will seek to implement the United Nations target of 0.7 per cent of the gross national product for official aid as soon as economic circumstances permit.  Labour will take account of human rights considerations when giving aid.  Help will continue to be given to the victims of repressive regimes, including the provision of refugee programmes.  The Labour Government approach the North-South dialogue in a spirit of cooperation. It will actively participate in the UNCTAD 5 and other negotiations seeking to establish a more just world trading system which recognizes the needs of poorer countries.  DÉTENTE AND DEFENCE  While actively pursuing a policy of détente, the Labour Government will continue to press for the implementation of the human rights provisions of the Helsinki Final Act. The Labour Government will continue to work for the success of the Mutual Balanced Force Reduction Talks in Vienna, and will give full support to the work of the United Nations Committee on Disarmament. The Labour Government will work for the speedy conclusion of a Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. We shall also give every encouragement to our American allies to achieve a successful conclusion to the vital Strategic Arms Limitation Talks. The Labour Government will maintain its support for Nato as an instrument of détente no less than of defence. The ultimate objective of a satisfactory relationship in Europe is the mutual and concurrent phasing-out of both Nato and the Warsaw Pact.  We shall continue with our plans to reduce the proportion of the nation's resources devoted to defence, so that the burden we bear will be brought into line with that carried by our main allies. A Labour Government would plan to ensure that savings in military expenditure did not lead to unemployment for those working in the defence industries. We shall give material support and encouragement to plans for industrial conversion so that the valuable resources of the defence industries can be used for the production of socially-needed goods.  In 1974, we renounced any intention of moving towards the production of a new generation of nuclear weapons or a successor to the Polaris nuclear force; we reiterate our belief that this is the best course for Britain. But many great issues affecting our allies and the world are involved, and a new round of strategic arms limitation negotiations will soon begin. We think it is essential that there must be a full and informed debate about these issues in the country before the necessary decision is taken.  Labour will give every encouragement to those working for the cause of international peace. We will consider establishing a peace research institute. We shall negotiate with our friends and allies, to prevent the supply of arms to countries where any such supply would increase the chances of international conflict or internal repression.  INTO THE EIGHTIES  This election comes at a time of change. unparalleled since 1945. A generation has now grown up in a welfare state which remains the envy of the world in health care and education. We have demonstrated a capacity for skill and inventiveness which keeps us at the forefront of world technology. Those are no mean achievements.  A Tory Government would put all this at risk. At work, they would substitute confrontation for cooperation. The free market forces they support would mean soaring inflation, rising prices and growing unemployment. Their uncaring meanness would mean misery for millions of the most vulnerable in our community, for their policy of cutting public expenditure can only mean a drastic reduction in all our social services.  Against this reactionary prospect, Labour sets its vision for the future. We seek to bring about a fundamental change in the balance of power and wealth in favour of working people and their families. We reject the concept that there is a choice to be made between a prosperous and efficient Britain and a caring and compassionate society. As democratic socialists, we believe they complement each other.  That is the spirit of this manifesto. A strong, fair, and more just society is the prize within our grasp. It is the message of hope for the future, based on a record of promises kept, that Labour puts to the British people at this election. "
NA,197905,"'The Real Fight is for Britain'  INTRODUCTION  With your support this election could be about something more important than a change of government. It could be a chance to change a failed political system.  Britain is deadlocked and that deadlock has meant economic and social decline. There can be very few voters, even among the keenest adherents of the Conservative or Labour cause, who really believe that our problems can all be solved just by yet another change of government. Oppositions promise grandiosely to generate 'the white hot heat of technological revolution' or to 'roll back the frontiers of the state'. It takes at least a year or two of government for them to come to terms with reality and discard their doctrinaire programmes. Each time the country is weakened further.  We have tried confrontation politics for long enough. In 1964, in 1970, in 1974, incoming governments promised that they held the key to Britain's industrial and social problems, if only they could undo the achievements of their predecessors and push their own prescriptions through Parliament. The hopes they raised have all been cruelly disappointed. It is high time to try a different pattern of government, which is based upon the consent and support of the broad majority of the electorate. That alone can now provide the basis for the long term programme of reform which Britain so desperately needs.  The Liberal Party has taken the first step towards breaking the deadlock during the past Parliament, by proving that co-operation among different parties is possible, practical and good for Britain. Unavoidably in this first experiment in a new style of government, our achievements were relatively limited. Many of the reforms which we wish to see implemented have had to wait.  But during the 18 months of the Liberal Agreement with the Labour Government the stability and consistency provided by co-operation among parties which represented a clear majority of the electorate, and the requirement that the Labour Government respect the views of that majority, helped to bring down the annual rate of inflation to 8 per cent. The Tories had raised it from 5.9 per cent to 13.2 per cent. Labour raised it further to a peak of 26.9 per cent, now it is rising again. The Lib-Lab Agreement also reduced Interest Rates to 10 per cent (Minimum Lending Rate). The Tories left it at 12.5 per cent under Labour it reached a peak of 15 per cent in October 1976. It is now back up again.  Industrial confidence began to return during the agreement. The divisive policies promoted by Labour's lunatic left-wing were effectively held in check. On Liberal insistence the law was changed to encourage profit-sharing, to help bridge the gulf of mistrust between the two sides of industry - which has so far led 48 companies to adopt new profit-sharing schemes.  Sadly, much of what was achieved for Britain during those 18 months has been thrown away since last October, as Labour clung on to office without secure and agreed majority support. If either of the two establishment parties grabs an exclusive hold on office after this election, Britain will slip even deeper into industrial confrontation and economic decay. The truth is, the Labour and Conservatives parties share a vested interest in the preservation of Britain's divided society. The unrepresentative nature of our electoral system protects them from the full effects of public disillusionment. Continuing industrial and social confrontation reinforces their links with the opposing sides of industry. Britain's secretive and centralised structure of government protects them, turn and turn about, from Parliament and the public.  Many, on both front benches, would rather see Britain's economy drift further behind our continental neighbours, would rather accept another cycle of industrial conflict and popular discontent, than touch the pattern of adversary politics which supports their alternating hold on political power.  I appeal to you, as a voter concerned with what is best for Britain, to throw your support behind the fresh approach which the Liberal Party represents - and which we have now demonstrated can work for Britain. The effectiveness of whatever government emerges after this election, the whole style of British government, will depend less upon which big/dinosaur Party returns with the largest number of parliamentary seats than upon the size of the Liberal wedge in the House of Commons. A mass Liberal vote throughout the country and many more Liberal seats will call the final whistle on a discredited Tory/Labour game.  Part Two of this manifesto sets out the Liberal Party's detailed electoral programme. I want here to stress four underlying themes: our commitment to fundamental political and constitutional reform; our proposals for economic and industrial reform; our plans to change and to simplify our overburdened tax system and our concern to bring to bear an environmental perspective across the whole range of government policies.  Political reform is the starting point. Until we break the two-party stranglehold, until we get away from the adversary class politics which are embedded in our parliamentary structure, we cannot successfully tackle the problems of economic weakness and industrial mistrust, of misspent resources in housing, of uncertain management of the public sector and of mishandled relations with our neighbours abroad. Electoral reform is the key to the lock. A democratic electoral system would deprive the Conservative and Labour parties of their ability to maintain electoral support by frightening wavering voters with the spectre of a single, unacceptable alternative. It would force them to face up to their own internal contradictions: the unstable coalition within a weakened Labour Party between its nationalising left and its conservative centre; the tensions within the Conservative Party between moderate Tories and doctrinaire free-marketeers. A democratic electoral system is needed, too, to generate the popular consent which is essential to support a long-term programme of economic and social reform.  The reluctant and unsatisfactory compromises which recent governments have offered in response to demands for the reform of Parliament, for an end to official secrecy, above all for devolution and decentralisation, also demonstrate the need for more thorough-going change and the inability of the establishment front benches to meet that need. Privately, many MPs from both the Labour and Conservative parties accept the case for far-reaching changes, but they are unwilling publicly to challenge their own leadership. A powerful wedge of Liberal MPs in the next Parliament could start a chain reaction of political change.  Economic and industrial reform must accompany and follow from political reform. Hardly surprisingly, the owner party and the union party have resisted the extension of democracy to industry, seeing a transformation of the pattern of industrial relations as a threat to their entrenched interests. Labour's preferred approach would only strengthen the position of trade unions, which are already one of the most conservative forces in our society. They do not want to involve the workforce as a whole. The Conservative alternative of lightly-disguised confrontation is even more dangerous in 1979 than their Selsdon Park proposals were in 1970, and would no doubt lead again after a painful two years in office to another expensive U-turn.  We Liberals seek instead to alter fundamentally the framework within which economic policy is made, to bring the different sides of industry together to work constructively to increase the well being of Britain - not to battle destructively over each other's share of a dwindling national cake.  The two-party confrontation has also wrought havoc with our tax system. Successive governments have tacked on new additions to an already unwieldy structure. It is too complex for most taxpayers to understand or to be sure of their rights and obligations. Many changes have been rushed through Parliament without adequate debate or consideration of their implications, at the behest of some vested interest or in the service of some outdated ideology. As a result tax avoidance has become our fastest growing industry. Liberals are concerned to simplify the personal tax system and reduce its burden to create a tax structure which encourages initiative and promotes a wider distribution of wealth, and above all to establish principles for a stable tax system which can command the respect of the electorate as a whole: wealthy, poor and average earners.  Neither of the two established parties has paid any serious attention to the long-term conservation of Britain's environment and resources. The argument over North Sea oil has been conducted in terms of immediate benefits rather than long term needs. The necessity to grow more of our own food and the conservation of man's natural habitat, including its flora and fauna, have been wrongly regarded as low priorities in politics. The debate over Britain's future dependence on nuclear power has hardly touched Parliament, conducted instead by environmental groups through the limited forum of the Windscale inquiry. Yet conservation and recycling of our limited and often finite resources is a vital issue for Britain's future, and an issue which concerns a growing section of our electorate. We Liberals have used our influence to force Parliament to pay more attention to the ecological perspective.  But Parliament as at present constructed does not find it easy to focus on questions like this, which do not fall conveniently into the categories established by the conventions of two-Party politics or the Left/Right dog-fight. Here is a key issue for Britain as the new Parliament takes us into the 1980s, too complicated for the current ritual of debate but too important to ignore.  It may seem paradoxical that Liberals call at once for more stable government and for radical change. Our concern is for long-term change, as opposed to the twists and turns of short-term policies which have characterised British government since the end of the Second World War. Worthwhile reforms for Britain's economy, for its industrial relations, its tax structure, its social services, its political system itself, can only be achieved after thorough examination and open debate - and can only be made to last if they command the respect and acceptance of the majority of the electorate.  That is why we are prepared to co-operate with other parties, even as we insist on the need for a fundamental break in Britain's political habits. Of course we want in time to see Britain led by a Liberal Government, implementing a coherent radical programme with the support of a clear majority of voters. But meanwhile we are prepared to co-operate with whichever party will go with us some way along the same road. It would, after all, be a profound and radical change for Britain to benefit from stability in economic policy, to gain a new consensus in pay policy and industrial relations, to achieve a wider agreement on the structure of taxation, or to open up a searching debate on the best use of Britain's limited resources.  It would be a radical change in itself for the next government to have to base its policies upon the support of the representatives of a genuine majority of the electorate. With your support, and the support of millions of voters like you, we can ensure that those changes take place.  David Steel  Economic and industrial recovery can only follow from a radical programme of political and social reform. In a liberal society in Britain, power and wealth will be distributed more widely, and government subjected to open democratic control. Participation and self-management will be encouraged, in government and in industry; public and private power will be, where possible, dispersed: individual initiative and independence will be rewarded; and a sense of partnership and community strengthened. But UK action alone cannot provide the stimulus for these major political and social changes. Many of our problems have to be tackled at the European level; action is also needed in the regions and nations of the United Kingdom, and within local communities through the efforts of voluntary bodies and community groups. But in an over-centralised Britain the process of reform is most urgently needed at the centre, in Westminster and Whitehall.  POLITICAL REFORM  Britain has a grossly undemocratic voting system, over-centralised government and an ineffective Parliament. Piecemeal changes have failed to introduce the necessary constitutional reforms. Bureaucracy and powerful organisations triumph at the expense of individuals who feel powerless to influence decisions that affect them. Liberals believe:  1 That electoral reform is the essential first step to representative parliament and government. 2 In open government accountable to a reformed parliament. 3 That decisions must be taken at the most local level practicable. 4 People and their communities must take part in decisions that affect them.  REFORM OF THE VOTING SYSTEM  Our first priority is electoral reform, because Britain's voting system is a root cause of our troubles:  It damages living standards by preventing consistent economic and social policies.  It leads to governments claiming a false mandate in favour of policies which have been decisively rejected by a majority of the voters.  It encourages native voting, frustrates the intelligent elector and leads to increasing alienation from the whole political system.  It rewards parties based on class distinctions and reinforces class divisions. Without reform our whole democracy is at risk.  Liberals demand proportional representation at all levels of government:  At Westminster, to give us representative parliaments and genuine majority government.  For future elections to the European Parliament, to avoid the disgrace of being the only member of the EEC not to use a fair voting system.  In local government, where the present system can often produce one-party dominance with its dangers of corruption.  The system adopted must ensure that every vote is of equal value and affects the result. It must also ensure that parties win roughly the same proportion of seats as their proportion of votes, allow voters a choice between candidates in each party, and reflect minority interest and viewpoints. Liberals believe that of available PR systems, the single transferable vote (STV) best achieves these results.  The main opposition to the overwhelming popular demand for electoral reform comes from political machines exercising unjustified privilege, and from those MP's who fear that if voters had a real choice they would not be re-elected. Liberals support the people in their fight against electoral privilege, and will give first priority in the new Parliament to obtaining a cast-iron commitment to the early introduction of electoral reform.  REFORM OF PARLIAMENT AND GOVERNMENT  Parliament should take control of its own business out of the hands of Government, and set up powerful Select Committees, to assert vigorous democratic control over the Executive. Section 2 of the Official Secrets Act should be repealed. We would introduce a Freedom of Information Bill similar to that of the Liberal MP Clement Freud in the last Parliament. This would give a right of public access to all official information except for certain listed categories (e.g. defence, economic and commercially sensitive information, and individual records).  A National Efficiency Audit should be set up to scrutinise public expenditure plans and reduce waste.  We need fixed dates for parliamentary elections to avoid the uncertainty which Prime Ministerial privilege imposes on the country.  The House of Lords should be replaced by a new, democratically chosen, second chamber which includes representatives of the nations and regions of the United Kingdom, and UK members of the European Parliament.  REFORM OF THE CONSTITUTION - A FEDERAL SOLUTION  Liberals supported the Scotland and Wales Acts, for all their defects, because we believed they offered a step in the right direction. These deficiencies - the weakness of the proposed Welsh Assembly and the constitutional contradictions in the Scotland Act - were exposed in the referendum debates and contributed to the results. This experience has reinforced our belief that the massive decentralisation of power from Westminster and Whitehall to Scotland, Wales and the major regions of England - for which we have long called - must involve legislative, executive and fiscal powers taken together. It has also demonstrated the need for a federal approach, which will involve a written constitution and a Supreme Court, as the only approach which can achieve legislative devolution within a workable framework of government for the United Kingdom.  Whatever the outcome of the election, Liberals will press for the widest possible consultations among the parties on constitutional reform.  LOCAL GOVERNMENT  The Tory reorganisation of local government proved an expensive disaster. In due course, the district and county councils must be replaced by one tier of multi-purpose authorities, whose boundaries match local needs and circumstances.  We support the establishment of parish councils in urban areas and the extension of the powers of existing parish councils. These councils should have a statutory right 'to be consulted' by local government and other bodies and a duty to stimulate local democracy.  NORTHERN IRELAND  Progress towards peace ought to come from within the Province but if outside help is required Great Britain must be prepared to contribute.  As an interim measure we propose that a 15 to 20 member Advisory Council be elected by the people of Northern Ireland using PR(STV). Such a council would be large enough to let every significant viewpoint have a voice but small enough for all its members to have real discussion with each other as well as with the Secretary of State and other political representatives.  The Council would:  1 Represent the views of the people of Northern Ireland to the Secretary of State and advise him accordingly, and  2 discuss how a constitutional conference should be set up to consider the means by which a generally acceptable form of government for the Province should be developed.  There must be no capitulation to violence. Direct rule must continue for the time being. The civil power must be given military assistance for as long as required. Britain will not force Northern Ireland to unite with the Republic of Ireland. All elections, including those for Westminster, must be by PR(STV). Continuing emphasis must be placed on the achievement of full human rights.  REFORMS TO STRENGTHEN CITIZENS' RIGHTS  The liberty of the individual requires constant vigilance. Restrictions can only be  justified if they protect the freedom of others. Liberals emphasise:  1 Legislation to protect individual rights. 2 A clear definition of citizenship. 3 Equal opportunities for men and women in all spheres, especially equal pay for work of equal value. 4 Protection for minority groups.  INDIVIDUAL FREEDOM  We need a Bill of Rights - as a first step, Britain should incorporate the European  Convention of Human Rights into United Kingdom law. Individual rights protected by  law should include:  The right to see, correct and add comments to one's personal records held by public and private bodies.  The right of individual privacy.  The right of free association with others, including the right to be represented through a Trade Union.  The right to work without having to be a member of a Trade Union and the right to cross a picket line without intimidation.  The rights of those in police custody, by means of revised Judges' Rules.  REDUCTION OF CRIME  The steady increase in crime can only be checked in the short run by:  Recruiting many more police, by improving working conditions.  Strengthening the links between the police and the communities that they serve. Raving the greatest practicable number of policemen 'on the beat' by day and night.  Making more resources and facilities (including secure accommodation) available to magistrates and others concerned with juvenile offenders, to curb juvenile crime and rehabilitate juvenile offenders.  Prisons must be modernised and further experiments made with non-custodial treatment, except for those whose imprisonment is necessary for the protection of society.  At the same time, we must realise that the long term solution is to attack vigorously the social, environmental and economic seedbeds of crime such as broken homes, bad schools, drink and drugs, decaying cities, bad housing, unemployment, and the boredom of mass production society.  NATIONALITY AND ENTRY TO THE UK  There should be only one class of citizenship for citizens of the UK and colonies. We would abolish the discrimination against non-patrials which creates second-class citizens. Citizens of the UK and colonies, including residents of Commonwealth countries who accepted the offer of remaining UK citizens when independence was granted, should have a right of entry. Spouses, children and other dependents of UK residents should be allowed to join their families in Britain and all children who have been born abroad of British mothers must have automatic right of citizenship.  Liberals deplore the Tory policy of inflaming people's fears about unrestricted immigration when the numbers of immigrants are actually falling. We should, wherever practicable, accept bona fide refugees.  EQUAL OPPORTUNITIES FOR WOMEN AND MEN  In order to ensure equal opportunities and rewards for women and men, we propose:  Changes in the patterns of work to allow for greater flexibility, part-time and weekend work, so that men and women can better meet their social and family needs.  Legislation to ensure that job evaluation schemes give adequate weight to factors found predominantly in work customarily done by women.  Removal of anomalies in National Insurance benefits which are based on outdated assumptions about the roles of men and women in contributing to family income. Reshaping the Equal Opportunities Commission to create an effective instrument against discrimination.  MINORITY RIGHTS  Britain is a diverse and multicultural society and Liberals rejoice in its richness, which owes much to the peoples of many different ethnic origins and cultures who have chosen to live here. We defend their right to maintain and develop their own traditions. Minority groups must be allowed to practise and advocate their beliefs, provided this does not reduce the freedom of others. We will protect and defend the rights of minorities by:  A comprehensive law out-lawing discrimination on grounds of race, sex or political belief with enforcement through a single Anti-Discrimination Board.  Providing a legal right for nomadic people to live according to their life-style so long as this does not harm others.  Removing all legal discrimination based on sexual orientation.  ECONOMIC AND INDUSTRIAL REFORM  The failures of our political system are reflected in our economic and industrial system. Confrontation is used instead of co-operation, resistance to change obstructs innovation, and frequent changes of government policy weaken our economy still further. Inflation has started to rise again, unemployment is unacceptably high and we are becoming increasingly uncompetitive in world markets. We have an unjust industrial society in which most workers are pitted against management and are denied any share in decision-taking or in profits.  We need a radical long-term programme of reforms to restore Britain's economy and industrial prosperity.  Liberals believe in:  1 Controlled and steady economic growth (in co-operation with our European partners), with greater attention to conservation of scarce resources, especially energy and land. 2 Harnessing the potential of all at work to improve enterprise and productivity. 3 Providing opportunities of useful work for all. 4 Protecting the citizen from inflation by reconciling rises in incomes with the real rate of growth of the economy. 5 Ensuring that the primary aim of government intervention in industry should be the promotion of viable market enterprises.  We see a revolution in attitudes amongst all at work through the introduction of Democracy in Industry as the key to reversing Britain's economic decline. This means employees sharing control and profits with shareholders. We would achieve this by giving all employees (irrespective of trade union membership) legal rights as individual members of their company; a direct vote in electing the board of directors jointly with the shareholders; rights to information about its plans and prospects; to participate in decisions through elected works councils; and to share in the profits. Liberals would encourage producer co-operatives by establishing a Cooperative Development Bank.  Efficient use of resources means reducing Britain's consumption of non-renewable raw materials, through government support (including tax incentives and penalties) for conservation, energy saving and recycling schemes. Whilst public expenditure already takes too large a share of our present national income, our health services, the schools and other essential public services cry out for more resources and the armed services remain underpaid. Economic recovery is essential to provide in the long run extra funds needed to continue the fight against poverty and deprivation. But in the immediate future, they can be found only by a relentless war against bureaucratic waste in central and local government.  More jobs in new industries, as well as in agriculture and in the service sector, must be created to replace those being lost through international competition and technological change. Further positive discrimination in favour of small businesses and producer co-operatives, through changes in the tax system and in planning controls, will help to provide the catalyst for industrial renewal. This will build upon the success of the Liberals in getting the Government to appoint a senior Cabinet minister for the small business field, which has already led to major tax concessions and other reliefs.  Employers, unions and public authorities must not be allowed to obstruct retraining. Liberals also challenge the belief in bigness for its own sake and concentration of control at the centre in both the private and public sectors. We aim at decentralisation, with greater autonomy for individual working units to encourage initiative and participation.  We would introduce a sustained prices and incomes policy based on wide consultation and enforceable at law. Our incomes policy would be supported by tax measures and a national minimum income. It would reward increases in value-added. We support attempts to synchronise annual wage settlements.  Liberal proposals for reducing personal taxation, introducing industrial democracy and profit-sharing are essential elements of an incomes policy since they would transform the industrial climate, restore incentive and reduce inflationary expectations.  The role of government is to provide a stable political and economic framework, not to dominate the economy. But it is dangerous to pretend that government can be taken out of economic and industrial planning, given the unavoidable importance of public spending and the active involvement of governments of competitor countries in supporting their industries and promoting their own economic interests. There is no case for further large-scale nationalisation in Britain; but attempts to denationalise at present would further disrupt the industries affected. The National Enterprise Board provides a valuable mechanism for assisting new industries and for aiding companies temporarily in difficulty, but it should disengage from them when they regain commercial viability.  The framework of government economic and industrial policy should be made more open and more subject to parliamentary control, by including Opposition parties on the National Economic Development Council and by establishing a Select Committee for Economic Affairs to consider its reports. Economic recovery is too vital to be subjected to all the twists and turns of partisan tactics, with Opposition parties glorying in their ignorance of facts which face government, and promising to reverse central decisions. Consistent economic policy requires a transformation of the way in which policies are debated and decided.  REFORM OF THE TAX SYSTEM  The British tax system frustrates initiative, inhibits new enterprises and discourages the wider spread of wealth. Penal rates of taxation encourage successful avoidance and evasion; whilst the poor and disadvantaged face a bewildering array of means tests and often fail to receive an adequate income.  Liberals believe in:  1 Providing an adequate minimum income for all. 2 Treating men and woman as equals for tax purposes, whether married or single. 3 Providing greater incentives for earning, productivity and enterprise. 4 Encouraging employees to build up a stake in their enterprise. 5 Widening the distribution and individual ownership of wealth.  The central reform needed is the introduction of Credit Income Tax which should:  Abolish the means test.  Introduce cash credits in place of personal allowances, social security payments and  national insurance benefits.  Provide credits for students of all ages, for rate relief and housing.  We also need a major switch from taxes on income to taxes on wealth and expenditure and propose:  Income Tax starting at 20 per cent with a top rate of 50 per cent.  A substantial increase in the level of income at which people first pay income tax.  A gifts and legacies tax paid by the recipient in place of Capital Transfer Tax.  A wealth tax on very large capital accumulations in place of the Investment Income  Surcharge which would be repealed.  Tax incentives for profit-sharing and employee share ownership.  Self assessment of tax liability with spot-checks by the Inland Revenue.  The changeover would be introduced over several years and be matched by indexation of taxes on drinks and tobacco, a single rate of VAT and the replacement of the employer's National Insurance contribution with a regionally varied payroll tax.  In a Federal Britain, regional and local government would have powers to raise the revenue they need for the services they provide. Income tax would be the main source of revenue at regional level with a tax on all land values (except agricultural land which would be zero-rated) being the main source of revenue for local government, which would also have powers to levy its own taxes. These would replace domestic rates.  A CARING SOCIETY  Liberals laid the foundations of the modern welfare state, but the original vision has been lost in a jungle of complex rules, means tests and decisions taken by remote officials. Those most in need often fail to get help or are caught by the poverty trap, whilst others fall through the gaps.  Liberals believe in:  1 Recreating services which recognise and respond to human needs, without excessive bureaucracy. 2 Making a reality of democratic control. 3 Providing greater choice for the individual. 4 Renewing inner city life.  THE CHANGE TO CREDIT INCOME TAX  Tax credits would meet the needs of the unemployed, retired, disabled and disadvantaged, and provide for maternity, children and students of all ages. All income would be taxable and where tax liability exceeds cash credits, the difference would be paid as tax; where credits exceed tax, individuals would receive cash regularly.  It would take several years to introduce a full tax credit scheme and in the meantime, we would give priority to:  Further increases in child benefit and the progressive conversion of other allowances against income tax into positive cash credits.  The introduction of a supplementary pension for all pensioners not qualifying for a full earnings-related pension under the new state pension scheme, reducing the number of pensioners needing to apply for supplementary benefit.  The introduction of a disablement allowance to help offset the additional expenditure caused by disablement.  The early introduction of housing credits based on average local rents. An increase in the mobility allowance and its extension to those over retirement age.  The implementation of the Finer' recommendations for one-parent families. The removal of the anomalies affecting widows and others through the application of the rule about overlapping benefits.  CARE IN THE COMMUNITY  Liberals seek to make the welfare state more effective and democratic. Providers and receivers of care should participate in running the services. The elderly (especially the over 75s), single-parent families, the disabled, the mentally handicapped and the mentally ill should have priority for additional resources.  We propose to tackle the mushrooming bureaucracy created by the Tories reorganisation of the health service by abolishing the area health authorities and bringing power back to the level of the local health district, and by placing the regional health authorities under the control of elected Scottish, Welsh and Regional assemblies.  We would give a greater role for voluntary organisations in partnership with official services. We oppose widespread closure of cottage hospitals and encourage the retention of local pharmacies.  HOUSING  Housing policy should retain existing communities and help build new ones. Priority must be given to improvement of existing houses instead of wholesale clearance and rebuilding. Everyone must have access to adequate housing with a wide choice of tenure and type of home - within the price they can afford. Private and council tenants should have reasonable security of tenure, and help control the management of housing and its immediate environment. We would introduce an Occupiers' and Owners' Charter which safeguards the rights of both tenants and owners of rented housing.  Housing co-operatives and smaller locally-based housing associations, which should be run democratically, should be encouraged. Councils should be required to build more homes for sale, and adequate resources should be provided for the full implementation of the Housing (Homeless Persons) Act, a measure introduced by Liberals.  Liberals would concentrate resources on inner cities by positive planning for community based jobs, schools, housing and entertainment.  EDUCATION AND TRAINING  We see education and training as a lifelong process that must be as widely available as possible to people of all ages. Secondary education must be non-selective with schools and colleges matched to local needs and working together to give maximum choice to students. Post-school education must be integrated with closer links between universities, polytechnics and further education.  We want to see:  Nursery education for all children whose parents want it.  The immediate right of rising-fives to enter primary school.  Use of successfully qualified teachers now unemployed to reduce class sizes and improve literacy and numeracy.  The involvement of all staff, parents and pupils in the running of schools through elected governing boards, and elected schools councils for secondary schools.  Improved links between schools and industry to ensure preparation for the world. Expansion of adult education and a major expansion of training and retraining facilities in which Britain still lags far behind its industrial competitors.  Education for retirement from employment.  CONSERVATION OF RESOURCES AND ENVIRONMENT  The industrial world consumes far too much of the world's non-renewable resources and is becoming increasingly dependent on imports of energy. Many of man's activities threaten the natural environment. Few recognise that after the year 2,000, shortages of food, raw materials and energy will mean drastic changes to our lifestyles. The bonanza of North Sea oil must not blind us to the dangers facing us when the oil runs out We must start to change our attitudes now. Liberals believe in:  1 Conservation and wiser use of scarce resources, especially land and energy. 2 War on waste and pollution. 3 The need to preserve the natural environment for future generations. 4 A re-ordering of our economic and social priorities to put them on a sound basis.  ENERGY AND NORTH SEA OIL  Liberals have repeatedly expressed doubts about a massive commitment to nuclear power and questioned the decision to expand the Windscale reprocessing plant. We must spread the extraction of North Sea oil over a longer period and use the revenues for long term investment with high priority for widespread energy conservation and developing alternative energy sources. We must:  Substantially increase research and development on fusion, wave, solar and other sustainable sources of energy.  Make greater use of combined heat and power systems which use waste heat.  Promote maximum efficiency in the production and use of coal and the use of primary fuels.  Set up a permanent Energy Commission to discuss in public future energy options. Not build any more nuclear power stations, at least until the problems of safe and permanent disposal of radioactive waste have been solved.  TRANSPORT  We would legislate to improve the standards of public transport in both towns and rural areas by making it more responsive to local needs and subject to democratic control. We would:  Encourage self-help and other schemes which improve freight and personal mobility in rural areas.  Amend the licensing laws governing stage carriage services to encourage local operators.  Plan jobs and homes closer together, discourage the private motor-car in city centres and provide better facilities for pedestrians and cyclists.  Limit expenditure on new road-building to socially desirable projects. Increase emphasis on road safety and therefore support the early introduction of tachographs in lorries.  Oppose further nationalisation of the ports and reject implementation of the Dock Work Regulations Scheme.  Retain the British Waters Board and increase expenditure on canal maintenance. Retain the British Rail network - and, where necessary, treat it as a social service. Support a rail-only Channel Tunnel financed with the aid of EEC finances. Improve the international communications of the regions by dispersing more international air traffic outside London.  FOOD AND AGRICULTURE  Liberal policy aims at providing a fair return for the farmer and reasonably priced food for the consumer. We also need a co-ordinated approach to the needs of food production and conservation of natural wild life which recognises their interdependence. We therefore propose:  Fundamental reform of the Common Agricultural Policy to produce competitive prices, avoid structural food surpluses and encourage efficient farming; the creation of a Land Bank to help new entrants to farming, and the expansion of co-operatives.  More land for small-holdings.  To raise the guaranteed minimum earnings for farmworkers.  Radical reform of the Common Fisheries Policy, conservation of fish stocks and a fifty mile exclusive limit for each member state within the EEC.  Increase the number of abattoirs to EEC standards to discourage the export of live animals.  SAFEGUARDING THE ENVIRONMENT  Land is a finite resource and we need careful planning to ensure an adequate supply of land for housing without using valuable farm land. Resources should be concentrated on inner city renewal and rural regeneration so that all parts of Britain are fit to live in. We have a duty to preserve in trust for future generations that which we inherit from the past. We would:  Make polluters pay the cost of their pollution. Drastically amend the Community Land Act.  Introduce taxation of the unimproved value of land, in its optimum permitted use (agricultural land to be zero-rated).  Introduced fiscal incentives for conservation, reclamation of industrial wasteland and recycling.  Encourage rurally based crafts and appropriate industries in rural areas. Support the demand of the General Election Co-ordinating Committee for Animal Protection for a Royal Commission on Animal Welfare.  Ban the importation and manufacture of any product derived from any species whose survival is threatened, and work for a total ban on commercial whaling. Expedite the work of the Commons Commissioners and legislate to implement the recommendations of the Royal Commission on Common Land with regard to access and management.  Preserve moors, scrub woodland, wetlands and other wildlife 'reservoirs'.  EUROPE AND THE WORLD  Liberals believe in:  1 Opposing all forms of aggression and imperialism. 2 Emphasising the protection of political and human rights as a basis for foreign policy. 3 Fostering closer co-operation within the European Community as the most constructive means of promoting Britain's best interests. 4 Supporting closer integration of defence, security and weapons procurement policies within the Atlantic Alliance as the most effective way of utilizing scarce resources. 5 Working for a more equitable distribution of power and wealth throughout the world. Liberals support positive co-operation with the developing countries.  Economic weakness and political failure have reduced Britain's standing and influence in the world and strained the friendship of our partners in Western Europe and beyond.  In Europe, we support a stronger and more democratic Community. Our long-term aim is a federal Europe based upon democratic institutions and an equitable sharing of economic and social burdens. This involves working towards economic and monetary union and more effective regional and social policies to overcome unemployment and deprivation. It also means commitment to the strengthening of the European Parliament. Only such a Parliament, elected by Proportional Representation, can provide democratic political solutions to Europe's problems and make nationalist solutions as irrelevant as they are dangerous.  Both Labour and Conservative Governments have been short-sighted and inward-looking in their attitudes to Europe. The Labour Government's nationalistic stance has harmed Britain's interests by blocking avenues for wider agreement. Britain's foreign policy should become increasingly concerted with our European partners, and our aim must therefore be the evolution of common European policies, not to pursue the nostalgic illusion of independent power.  Europe's foreign policies must include continued close relations with the United States. We firmly support a peaceful settlement of the Middle East conflict within the framework of the relevant United Nations Resolutions. In Southern Africa, Britain has a special historic responsibility, and we must continue to work with our allies and with the United Nations to promote peaceful change. We support the Anglo-American efforts being made to end bloodshed and to establish an independent Zimbabwe with a Government elected under international supervision. We believe that sanctions should not be lifted nor recognition accorded until such a government is established.  Europe's defence must be a common defence, based on integrated forces and an integrated command within the Atlantic Alliance. Co-operation in armaments should be accompanied by ending British arms sales except in the context of a treaty of mutual defence. The fundamental solution to the problem depends on the establishment of a credible system of international controls of arms sales under the aegis of the United Nations. Arms control negotiations with the Soviet Union and its allies should be vigorously pursued to promote a basis for the mutual and balanced reduction of forces and armaments.  It is one of the most important duties of Europe to help those peoples of the Third World who still lack effective influence in the international economy. In this context, Britain, because of our links with the Commonwealth, has a distinctive contribution to make. Liberals want to see reductions in the barriers to world trade, and support current negotiations to give the developing countries stable prices for their raw materials UK official aid should be increased to achieve the targets agreed by the United Nations.  The work of the UN specialised agencies and of voluntary organisations should be generously supported. Aid should be directed wherever possible through multi-lateral channels, but there is no justice in assisting governments which systematically deny basic human rights to their own citizens.  CONCLUSION  The Liberal programme offers a coherent framework for a series of reforms which will need years of intensive effort. This requires for its success the support of an informed public, co-operation in industry, and a new spirit of mutual understanding among the democratic political parties. The vital choice at this election is whether Britain will start along this new path, or continue to shuffle down the slope of economic and political decline. The contents of the first Queen's Speech are less important than the membership, composition and spirit of the new Parliament. A stronger Liberal presence, backed by a powerful Liberal vote throughout the country, will ensure that the door is opened to fundamental change, not slammed shut again by the negative reactions of the old two-party game which has failed the nation."
"Conservatives",197905,"FOREWORD  FOR ME, THE HEART OF POLITICS is not political theory, it is people and how they want to live their lives.  No one who has lived in this country during the last five years can fail to be aware of how the balance of our society has been increasingly tilted in favour of the State at the expense of individual freedom.  This election may be the last chance we have to reverse that process, to restore the balance of power in favour of the people. It is therefore the most crucial election since the war.  Together with the threat to freedom there has been a feeling of helplessness, that we are a once great nation that has somehow fallen behind and that it is too late now to turn things round.  I don't accept that. 1 believe we not only can, we must. This manifesto points the way.  It contains no magic formula or lavish promises. It is not a recipe for an easy or a perfect life. But it sets out a broad framework for the recovery of our country, based not on dogma, but On reason, on common sense, above all on the liberty of the people under the law.  The things we have in common as a nation far outnumber those that set us apart.  It is in that spirit that I commend to you this manifesto.  Margaret Thatcher  I. OUR FIVE TASKS  THIS ELECTION is about the future of Britain - a great country which seems to have lost its way. It is a country rich in natural resources, in coal, oil, gas and fertile farmlands. It is rich, too, in human resources, with professional and managerial skills of the highest calibre, with great industries and firms whose workers can be the equal of any in the world We are the inheritors of a long tradition of parliamentary democracy and the rule of law.  Yet today, this country is faced with its most serious problems since the Second World War. What has happened to our country, to the values we used to share, to the success and prosperity we once took for granted?  During the industrial strife of last winter, confidence, self-respect, common sense, and even our sense of common humanity were shaken. At times this society seemed on the brink of disintegration.  Some of the reasons for our difficulties today are complex and go back many years. Others are more simple and more recent. We do not lay all the blame on the Labour Party: but Labour have been in power for most of the last fifteen years and cannot escape the major responsibility.  They have made things worse in three ways. First, by practising the politics of envy and by actively discouraging the creation of wealth, they have set one group against another in an often bitter struggle to gain a larger share of a weak economy.  Second, by enlarging the role of the State and diminishing the role of the individual, they have crippled the enterprise and effort on which a prosperous country with improving social services depends.  Third, by heaping privilege without responsibility on the trade unions, Labour have given a minority of extremists the power to abuse individual liberties and to thwart Britain's chances of success. One result is that the trade union movement, which sprang from a deep and genuine fellow-feeling for the brotherhood of man, is today more distrusted and feared than ever before.  It is not just that Labour have governed Britain badly. They have reached a dead-end. The very nature of their Party now  prevents them from governing successfully in a free society and mixed economy.  Divided against themselves; devoid of any policies except those which have led to and would worsen our present troubles; bound inescapably by ties of history, political dogma and financial dependence to a single powerful interest group, Labour have demonstrated yet again that they cannot speak and dare not act for the nation as a whole.  Our country's relative decline is not inevitable. We in the Conservative Party think we can reverse it, not because we think we have all the answers but because we think we have the one answer that matters most. We want to work with the grain of human nature, helping people to help themselves - and others. This is the way to restore that self-reliance and self-confidence which are the basis of personal responsibility and national success.  Attempting to do too much, politicians have failed to do those things which should be done. This has damaged the country and the authority of government. We must concentrate on what should be the priorities for any government. They are set out in this manifesto.  Those who look in these pages for lavish promises or detailed commitments on every subject will look in vain. We may be able to do more in the next five years than we indicate here. We believe we can. But the Conservative government's first job will be to rebuild our economy and reunite a divided and disillusioned people.  Our five tasks are:  (i) To restore the health of our economic and social life, by controlling inflation and striking a fair balance between the rights and duties of the trade union movement.  (2) To restore incentives so that hard work pays, success is rewarded and genuine new jobs are created in an expanding economy.  (3) To uphold Parliament and the rule of law.  (4) To support family life, by helping people to become home-owners, raising the standards of their children's education, and concentrating welfare services on the effective support of the old, the sick, the disabled and those who are in real need.  (5) To strengthen Britain's defences and work with our allies to protect our interests in an increasingly threatening world.  This is the strategy of the next Conservative government.  2. RESTORING THE BALANCE  SOUND MONEY and a fair balance between the rights and obligations of unions, management and the community in which they work are essential to economic recovery. They should provide the stable conditions in which pay bargaining can take place as responsibly in Britain as it does in other countries.  THE CONTROL OF INFLATION  Under Labour prices have risen faster than at any peacetime period in the three centuries in which records have been kept, and inflation is now accelerating again. The pound today is worth less than half its '974 value. On present form it would be halved in value yet again within eight years. Inflation on this scale has come near to destroying our political and social stability.  To master inflation, proper monetary discipline is essential, with publicly stated targets for the rate of growth of the money supply. At the same time, a gradual reduction in the size of the Government's borrowing requirement is also vital. This Government's price controls have done nothing to prevent inflation, as is proved by the doubling of prices since they came to power. All the controls have achieved is a loss of jobs and a reduction in consumer choice.  The State takes too much of the nation's income; its share must be steadily reduced. When it spends and borrows too much, taxes, interest rates, prices and unemployment rise so that in the long run there is less wealth with which to improve Our standard of living and our social services.  BETTER VALUE FOR MONEY  Any future government which sets out honestly to reduce inflation and taxation will have to make substantial economies, and there should be no doubt about our intention to do so. We do not pretend that every saving can be made without change or complaint; but if the Government does not economise the sacrifices required of ordinary people will be all the greater.  Important savings can be made in several ways. We will scrap expensive Socialist programmes, such as the nationalisation of building land. We shall reduce government intervention in industry and particularly that of the National Enterprise Board, whose borrowing powers are planned to reach £4.5 billion. We shall ensure that selective assistance to industry is not wasted, as it was in the case of Labour's assistance to certain oil platform yards, on which over £20 million of public money was spent but no orders received.  The reduction of waste, bureaucracy and over-government will also yield substantial savings. For example, we shall look for economies in the cost (about £1.2 billion) of running our tax and social security systems. By comparison with private industry, local direct labour schemes waste an estimated £400 million a year. Other examples of waste abound, such as the plan to spend £50 million to build another town hall in Southwark.  TRADE UNION REFORM  Free trade unions can only flourish in a free society. A strong and responsible trade union movement could play a big part in our economic recovery. We cannot go on, year after year, tearing ourselves apart in increasingly bitter and calamitous industrial disputes. In bringing about economic recovery, we should all be on the same side. Government and public, management and unions, employers and employees, all have a common interest in raising productivity and profits, thus increasing investment and employment, and improving real living standards for everyone in a high-productivity, high-wage, low-tax economy. Yet at the moment we have the reverse an economy in which the Government has to hold wages down to try to make us competitive with other countries where higher real wages are paid for by higher output.  The crippling industrial disruption which hit Britain last winter had several causes: years with no growth in production; rigid pay control; high marginal rates of taxation; and the extension of trade union power and privileges. Between 1974 and 1976, Labour enacted a 'militants' charter' of trade union legislation. It tilted the balance of power in bargaining throughout industry away from responsible management and towards unions, and sometimes towards unofficial groups of workers acting in defiance of their official union leadership.  We propose three changes which must be made at once. Although the Government refused our offer of support to carry them through the House of Commons last January, our proposals command general assent inside and outside the trade union movement.  I. PICKETING  Workers involved in a dispute have a right to try peacefully to persuade others to support them by picketing, but we believe that right should be limited to those in dispute picketing at their own place of work. In the last few years some of the picketing we have witnessed has gone much too far. Violence, intimidation and obstruction cannot be tolerated. We shall ensure that the protection of the law is available to those not concerned in the dispute but who at present can suffer severely from secondary action (picketing, blacking and blockading). This means an immediate review of the existing law on immunities in the light of recent decisions, followed by such amendment as may be appropriate of the 1976 legislation in this field. We shall also make any further changes that are necessary so that a citizen's right to work and go about his or her lawful business free from intimidation or obstruction is guaranteed.  2. THE CLOSED SHOP  Labour's strengthening of the closed shop has made picketing a more objectionable weapon. In some disputes, pickets have threatened other workers with the withdrawal of their union cards if they refuse to co-operate. No union card can mean no job. So the law must be changed. People arbitrarily excluded or expelled from any union must be given the right of appeal to a court of law. Existing employees and those with personal conviction must be adequately protected, and if they lose their jobs as a result of a closed shop they must be entitled to ample compensation.  In addition, all agreements for a closed shop must be drawn up in line with the best practice followed at present and only if an overwhelming majority of the workers involved vote for it by secret ballot. We shall therefore propose a statutory code under Section 6 of the 1975 Employment Protection Act. We will not permit a closed shop in the non-industrial civil service and will resist further moves towards it in the newspaper industry. We are also committed to an enquiry into the activities of the SLADE union, which have done so much to bring trade unionism into disrepute.  3. WIDER PARTICIPATION  Too often trade unions are dominated by a handful of extremists who do not reflect the common-sense views of most union members.  Wider use of secret ballots for decision-making throughout the trade union movement should be given every encouragement. We will therefore provide public funds for postal ballots for union elections and other important issues. Every trade unionist should be free to record his decisions as every voter has done for a hundred years in parliamentary elections, without others watching and taking note.  We welcome closer involvement of workers, whether trade unionists or not, in the decisions that affect them at their place of work. It would be wrong to impose by law a system of participation in every company. It would be equally wrong to use the pretext of encouraging genuine worker involvement in order simply to increase union power or facilitate union control of pension funds.  TOO MANY STRIKES  Further changes may be needed to encourage people to behave responsibly and keep the bargains they make at work. Many deficiencies of British industrial relations are without foreign parallel. Strikes are too often a weapon of first rather than last resort. One cause is the financial treatment of strikers and their families. In reviewing the position, therefore, we shall ensure that unions bear their fair share of the cost of supporting those of their members who are on strike.  Labour claim that industrial relations in Britain cannot be improved by changing the law. We disagree. If the law can be used to confer privileges, it can and should also be used to establish obligations. We cannot allow a repetition of the behaviour that we saw outside too many of our factories and hospitals last winter.  RESPONSIBLE PAY BARGAINING  Labour's approach to industrial relations and their disastrous economic policies have made realistic and responsible pay bargaining almost impossible. After encouraging the 'social contract' chaos of 1974-5, they tried to impose responsibility by the prolonged and rigid control of incomes. This policy collapsed last winter as we warned that it would. The Labour government then came full circle with the announcement of yet another 'social contract' with the unions. For five years now, the road to ruin has been paved with such exchanges of promises between the Labour government and the unions.  To restore responsible pay bargaining, we must all start by recognising that Britain is a low-paid country because we have steadily become less efficient, less productive, less reliable and less competitive. Under this Government, we have more than doubled our pay but actually produced less in manufacturing industry. It will do yet further harm to go on printing money to pay ourselves more without first earning more. That would lead to even higher prices, fewer jobs and falling living standards.  The return to responsibility will not be easy. It requires that people keep more of what they earn; that effort and skill earn larger rewards; and that the State leaves more resources for industry. There should also be more open and informed discussion of the Government's economic objectives (as happens, for example, in Germany and other countries) so that there is wider understanding of the consequences of unrealistic bargaining and industrial action.  Pay bargaining in the private sector should be left to the companies and workers concerned. At the end of the day, no one should or can protect them from the results of the agreements they make.  Different considerations apply to some extent to the public sector, of whose seven million workers the Government directly employs only a minority. In the great public corporations, pay bargaining should be governed, as in private ones, by what each can afford. There can be no question of subsidising excessive pay deals.  Pay bargaining in central and local government, and other services such as health and education, must take place within the limits of what the taxpayer and ratepayer can afford. It is conducted under a variety of arrangements, some of long standing, such as pay research. In consultation with the unions, we will reconcile these with the cash limits used to control public spending, and seek to conclude no-strike agreements in a few essential services. Bargaining must also be put on a sounder economic footing, so that public sector wage settlements take full account of supply and demand md diflerences between regions, manning levels, job security and pension arrangements.  3. A MORE PROSPEROUS COUNTRY  LABOUR HAVE GONE to great lengths to try to conceal the damage they have done to the economy and to our prospects of economic expansion. Even in the depression of the 19305 the British economy progressed more than it has under this Labour government. Their favourite but totally false excuse is that their appalling record is all due to the oil crisis and the world-wide economic depression. Yet since the oil crisis, despite our coal, and gas and oil from the North Sea, prices and unemployment in Britain have risen by more than in almost any other major industrial country. And output has risen by less. With much poorer energy supplies than Britain, the others have nonetheless done much better because they have not had a Labour government or suffered from Labour's mistakes.  To become more prosperous, Britain must become more productive and the British people must be given more incentive.  CUTTING INCOME TAX  We shall cut income tax at all levels to reward hard work, responsibility and success; tackle the poverty trap; encourage saving and the wider ownership of property; simplify taxes - like VAT; and reduce tax bureaucracy.  It is especially important to cut the absurdly high marginal rates of tax both at the bottom and top of the income scale. It must pay a man or woman significantly more to be in, rather than out of; work. Raising tax thresholds will let the low-paid out of the tax net altogether, and unemployment and short-term sickness benefit must be brought into the computation of annual income.  The top rate of income tax should be cut to the European average and the higher tax bands widened. To encourage saving we will reduce the burden of the investment income surcharge. This will greatly help those pensioners who pay this additional tax on the income from their life-time savings, and who suffer so badly by comparison with members of occupational or inflation-proofed pension schemes.  Growing North Sea oil revenues and reductions in Labour s public spending plans Will not be enough to pay for the income tax cuts the country needs. We must therefore be prepared to switch to some extent from taxes on earnings to taxes on spending. Value Added Tax does not apply, and will not be extended, to necessities like food, fuel, housing and transport. Moreover the levels of State pensions and other benefits take price rises into account.  Labour's extravagance and incompetence have once again imposed a heavy burden on ratepayers this year. But cutting income tax must take priority for the time being over abolition of the domestic rating system.  A PROPERTY-OWNING DEMOCRACY  Unlike Labour, we want more people to have the security and satisfaction of owning property Our proposals for encouraging home ownership are contained in Chapter 5.  We reject Labour's plan for a Wealth Tax. We shall deal with the most damaging features of the Capital Transfer and Capital Gains Taxes, and propose a simpler and less oppressive system of capital taxation in the longer term. We will expand and build on existing schemes for encouraging employee share-ownership and our tax policies generally will provide incentive to save and build up capital.  INDUSTRY, COMMERCE AND JOBS  Lower taxes on earnings and savings will encourage economic growth. But on their own they will not be enough to secure it.  Profits are the foundation of a free enterprise economy. In Britain profits are still dangerously low. Price controls can prevent them from reaching a level adequate for the investment we need. In order to ensure effective competition and fair pricing policies, we will review the working of the Monopolies Commission, the Office of Fair Trading and the Price Commission, with the legislation which governs their activities.  Too much emphasis has been placed on attempts to preserve existing jobs. We need to concentrate more on the creation of conditions in which new, more modern, more secure, better paid jobs come into existence. This is the best way of helping the unemployed and those threatened with the loss of their jobs in the future.  Government strategies and plans cannot produce revival, nor can subsidies. Where it is in the national interest to help a firm in difficulties, such help must be temporary and tapered.  We all hope that those firms which are at present being helped by the taxpayer will soon be able to succeed by themselves; but success or failure lies in their own hands.  Of course, government can help to ease industrial change in those regions dependent on older, declining industries. We do not propose sudden, sharp changes in the measures now in force. However, there is a strong case for relating government assistance to projects more closely to the number of jobs they create.  NATIONALISATION  The British people strongly oppose Labour's plans to nationalise yet more firms and industries such as building, banking, insurance, pharmaceuticals and road haulage. More nationalisation would further impoverish us and further undermine our freedom. We will offer to sell back to private ownership the recently nationalised aerospace and shipbuilding concerns, giving their employees the opportunity to purchase shares.  We aim to sell shares in the National Freight Corporation to the general public in order to achieve substantial private investment in it. We will also relax the Traffic Commissioner licensing regulations to enable new bus and other services to develop-particularly in rural areas-and we will encourage new private operators.  Even where Labour have not nationalised they interfere too much. We shall therefore amend the '975 Industry Act and restrict the powers of the National Enterprise Board solely to the administration of the Government's temporary shareholdings, to be sold off as circumstances permit. We want to see those industries that remain nationalised running more successfully and we will therefore interfere less with their management and set them a clearer financial discipline in which to work.  High productivity is the key to the future of industries like British Rail, where improvements would benefit both the work-force and passengers who have faced unprecedented fare increases over the last five years.  FAIR TRADE  Just as we reject nationalisation, so we are opposed to the other Socialist panacea-import controls. They would restrict consumer choice, raise prices and invite damaging retaliation against British goods overseas. We will vigorously oppose all kinds of dumping and other unfair foreign trade practices that undermine jobs at home.  We fully support the renegotiated Multi-fibre Arrangement for textiles and will insist that it is monitored effectively and speedily. We also believe in a revised 'safeguard' clause under GATT, to give us a better defence against sudden and massive surges of imports that destroy jobs.  SMALL BUSINESSES  The creation of new jobs depends to a great extent on the success of smaller businesses. They have been especially hard hit under Labour. Our cuts in direct and capital taxation, the simplification of VAT and our general economic and industrial relations policies are the key to their future. We shall make planning restraints less rigid; reduce the number of official forms and make them simpler; provide safeguards against unfair competition from direct labour; review the new 714 Certificate system for subcontractors and review with representatives of the self-employed their National Insurance and pension position. We shall amend laws such as the Employment Protection Act where they damage smaller businesses-and larger ones too-and actually prevent the creation of jobs.  We shall also undertake a thorough review of the enforcement procedures of Customs and Excise and the Inland Revenue, and introduce an easier regime for small firms in respect of company law and the disclosure of their affairs.  ENERGY  The development of our energy resources provides a challenge for both our nationalised industries and the private sector. Nowhere has private enterprise been more successful in creating jobs and wealth for the nation than in bringing North Sea oil and gas ashore. These benefits will be short-lived unless we pursue a vigorous policy for energy saving. Labour's interference has discouraged investment and could cost Britain billions of pounds in lost revenue. We shall undertake a complete review of all the activities of the British National Oil Corporation as soon as we take office. We shall ensure that our oil tax and licensing policies encourage new production.  We believe that a competitive and efficient coal industry has an important role in meeting energy demand, together with a proper contribution from nuclear power. All energy developments raise important environmental issues, and we shall ensure the fullest public participation in major new decisions.  AGRICULTURE  Our agricultural and food industries are as important and as efficient as any that we have. They make an immense contribution to our balance of payments; they provide jobs for millions of people and they sustain the economy of the countryside. Labour have seriously undermined the profitability of these industries, without protecting consumers against rising food prices which have more than doubled during their term of office. We must ensure that these industries have the means to keep abreast of those in other countries.  We believe that radical changes in the operation of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) are necessary. We would, in particular, aim to devalue the Green Pound within the normal lifetime of a Parliament to a point which would enable our producers to compete on level terms with those in the rest of the Community. We will insist on a freeze in CAP prices for products in structural surplus. This should be maintained until the surpluses are eliminated. We could not entertain discriminatory proposals such as those which the Commission recently put forward for milk production.  The Uplands are an important part of our agriculture. Those who live and work there should enjoy a reasonable standard of life.  FISHING  The Government's failure to negotiate with our Community partners proper arrangements for fishing has left the industry in a state of uncertainty. The general adoption of 200-mile limits has fundamentally altered the situation which existed when the Treaty of Accession was negotiated. We would work for an agreement which recognised: first, that United Kingdom waters contained more fish than those of the rest of the Community countries put together; secondly, the loss of fishing opportunities experienced by our fishermen; thirdly, the rights of inshore fishermen; last, and perhaps most important of all, the need for effective measures to conserve fish stocks which would be policed by individual coastal states. In the absence of agreement, we would not hesitate to take the necessary measures on our own, but of course on a non-discriminatory basis.  ANIMAL WELFARE  The welfare of animals is an issue that concerns us all. There are problems in certain areas and we will act immediately where it is necessary. More specifically, we will give full support to the EEC proposals on the transportation of animals. We shall update the Brambell Report, the codes of welfare for farm animals, and the legislation on experiments on live animals. We shall also re-examine the rules and enforcement applying to the export of live animals and shall halt the export of cows and ewes recently calved and lambed.  4. THE RULE OF LAW  THE MOST DISTURBING THREAT to our freedom and security is the growing disrespect for the rule of law. In government as in opposition, Labour have undermined it. Yet respect for the rule of law is the basis of a free and civilised life. We will restore it, re-establishing the supremacy of Parliament and giving the right priority to the fight against crime.  THE FIGHT AGAINST CRIME  The number of crimes in England and Wales is nearly half as much again as it was in 1973. The next Conservative government will spend more on fighting crime even while we economise elsewhere.  Britain needs strong, efficient police forces with high morale. Improved pay and conditions will help Chief Constables to recruit up to necessary establishment levels. We will therefore implement in full the recommendations of the Edmund Davies Committee. The police need more time to detect crime. So we will ease the weight of traffic supervision duties and review cumbersome court procedures which waste police time. We will also review the traffic laws, including the totting-up procedure.  DETERRING THE CRIMINAL  Surer detection means surer deterrence. We also need better crime prevention measures and more flexible, more effective sentencing. For violent criminals and thugs really tough sentences are essential. But in other cases long prison terms are not always the best deterrent. So we want to see a wider variety of sentences available to the courts. We will therefore amend the 1961 Criminal Justice Act which limits prison sentences on young adult offenders, and revise the Children and Young Persons Act 1969 to give magistrates the power to make residential and secure care orders on juveniles.  We need more compulsory attendance centres for hooligans at junior and senior levels. In certain detention centres we will experiment with a tougher regime as a short, sharp shock for young criminals. For certain types of offenders, we also support the greater use of community service orders, intermediate treatment and attendance centres. Unpaid fines and compensation orders are ineffective. Fines should be assessed to punish the offender within his means and then be backed by effective sanctions for non-payment.  Many people advocate capital punishment for murder. This must remain a matter of conscience for Members of Parliament. But we will give the new House of Commons an early opportunity for a free vote on this issue.  IMMIGRATION AND RACE RELATIONS  The rights of all British citizens legally settled here are equal before the law whatever their race, colour or creed. And their opportunities ought to be equal too. The ethnic minorities have already made a valuable contribution to the life of our nation. But firm immigration control for the future is essential if we are to achieve good community relations. It will end persistent fears about levels of immigration and will remove from those settled, and in many cases born here, the label of 'immigrant'.  (i) We shall introduce a new British Nationality Act to define entitlement to British citizenship and to the right of abode in this country. It will not adversely affect the right of anyone now permanently settled here.  (ii) We shall end the practice of allowing permanent settlement for those who come here for a temporary stay.  (iii) We shall limit entry of parents, grandparents and children over 18 to a small number of urgent compassionate cases.  (iv) We shall end the concession introduced by the Labour government in 1974 to husbands and male fiancés.  (v) We shall severely restrict the issue of work permits.  (vi) We shall introduce a Register of those Commonwealth wives and children entitled to entry for settlement under the 1971 Immigration Act.  (vii) We shall then introduce a quota system, covering everyone outside the European Community, to control all entry for settlement.  (viii) We shall take firm action against illegal immigrants and overstayers and help those immigrants who genuinely wish to leave this country-but there can be no question of compulsory repatriation.  We will encourage the improvement of language training in schools and factories and of training facilities for the young unemployed in the ethnic communities. But these measures will achieve little without the effective control of immigration. That is essential for racial harmony in Britain today.  THE SUPREMACY OF PARLIAMENT  In recent years, Parliament has been weakened in two ways. First, outside groups have been allowed to usurp some of its democratic functions. Last winter, the Government permitted strike committees and pickets to take on powers and responsibilities which should have been discharged by Parliament and the police. Second, the traditional role of our legislature has suffered badly from the growth of government over the last quarter of a century.  We will see that Parliament and no other body stands at the centre of the nation's life and decisions, and we will seek to make it effective in its job of controlling the Executive.  We sympathise with the approach of the all-party parliamentary committees which put forward proposals last year for improving the way the House of Commons legislates and scrutinises public spending and the work of government departments. We will give the new House of Commons an early chance of coming to a decision on these proposals.  The public has rightly grown anxious about many constitutional matters in the last few years - partly because our opponents have proposed major constitutional changes for party political advantage. Now Labour want not merely to abolish the House of' Lords but to put nothing in its place. This would be a most dangerous step. A strong Second Chamber is necessary not only to revise legislation but also to guarantee our constitution and liberties.  It is not only the future of the Second Chamber which is at issue. We are committed to discussions about the future government of Scotland, and have put forward proposals for improved parliamentary control of administration in Wales. There are other important matters, such as a possible Bill of Rights, the use of referendums, and the relationship between Members of the European Parliament and Westminster, which we shall wish to discuss with all parties.  NORTHERN IRELAND  We shall maintain the Union of Great Britain and Northern Ireland in accordance with the wish of the majority in the Province. Its future still depends on the defeat of terrorism and the restoration of law and order. We shall continue with the help of the courage, resolution and restraint of the Security Forces-to give it the highest priority. There will be no amnesty for convicted terrorists.  In the absence of devolved government, we will seek to establish one or more elected regional councils with a wide range of powers over local services. We recognise that Northern Ireland's industry will continue to require government support.  5. HELPING THE FAMILY  HOMES OF OUR OWN  To most people ownership means first and foremost a home of their own.  Many find it difficult today to raise the deposit for a mortgage. Our tax cuts will help them. We shall encourage shared purchase schemes which will enable people to buy a house or fiat on mortgage, on the basis initially of a part-payment which they complete later when their incomes are high enough. We should like in time to improve on existing legislation with a realistic grants scheme to assist first-time buyers of cheaper homes. As it costs about three times as much to subsidise a new council house as it does to give tax relief to a home buyer, there could well be a substantial saving to the tax and ratepayer.  The prospect of very high mortgage interest rates deters some people from buying their homes and the reality can cause acute difficulties to those who have done so. Mortgage rates have risen steeply because of the Government's financial mismanagement. Our plans for cutting government spending and borrowing will lower them.  THE SALE OF COUNCIL HOUSES  Many families who live on council estates and in new towns would like to buy their own homes but either cannot afford to or are prevented by the local authority or the Labour government. The time has come to end these restrictions. In the first session of the next Parliament we shall therefore give council and new town tenants the legal right to buy their homes, while recognising the special circumstances of rural areas and sheltered housing for the elderly. Subject to safeguards over resale, the terms we propose would allow a discount on market values reflecting the fact that council tenants effectively have security of tenure. Our discounts will range from 33 per cent after three years, rising with length of tenancy to a maximum of 50 per cent after twenty years. We shall also ensure that 100 per cent mortgages are available for the purchase of council and new town houses. We shall introduce a right for these tenants to obtain limited term options on their homes so that they know in advance the price at which they can buy, while they save the money to do so.  As far as possible, we will extend these rights to housing association tenants. At the very least, we shall give these associations the power to sell to their tenants.  Those council house tenants who do not wish to buy their homes will be given new rights and responsibilities under our Tenants' Charter.  REVIVING THE PRIVATE RENTED SECTOR  As well as giving new impetus to the movement towards home ownership, we must make better use of our existing stock of houses. Between 1973 and 1977 no fewer than 400,000 dwellings were withdrawn from private rental. There are now hundreds of thousands of empty properties in Britain which are not let because the owners are deterred by legislation. We intend to introduce a new system of shorthold tenure which will allow short fixed-term lettings of these properties free of the most discouraging conditions of the present law. This provision will not, of course, affect the position of existing tenants. There should also be more flexible arrangements covering accommodation for students. At the same time, we must try to achieve a greater take-up in rent allowances for poorer tenants.  PROTECTING THE ENVIRONMENT  The quality of our environment is a vital concern to all of us. The last Conservative government had a proud record of achievement in reducing pollution, and protecting our heritage and countryside. We shall continue to give these issues a proper priority. Subject to the availability of resources we shall pay particular attention to the improvement and restoration of derelict land, the disposal and recycling of dangerous and other wastes, and reducing pollution of our rivers and canals.  We attach particular importance to measures to reduce fuel consumption by improving insulation.  STANDARDS IN EDUCATION  The Labour Party is still obsessed with the structure of the schools system, paying too little regard to the quality of education. As a result we have a system which in the view of many of our parents and teachers all too often fails - at a cost of over £8 billion a year  - even to provide pupils with the means of communication and understanding. We must restore to every child, regardless of background, the chance to progress as far as his or her abilities allow.  We will halt the Labour government's policies which have led to the destruction of good schools; keep those of proven worth; and repeal those sections of the 1976 Education Act which compel local authorities to reorganise along comprehensive lines and restrict their freedom to take up places at independent schools.  We shall promote higher standards of achievement in basic skills. The Government's Assessment of Performance Unit will set national standards in reading, writing and arithmetic, monitored by tests worked out with teachers and others and applied locally by education authorities. The Inspectorate will be strengthened. In teacher training there must be more emphasis on practical skills and on maintaining discipline.  Much of our higher education in Britain has a world-wide reputation for its quality. We shall seek to ensure that this excellence is maintained. We are aware of the special problems associated with the need to increase the number of high-quality entrants to the engineering professions. We shall review the relationship between school, further education and training to see how better use can be made of existing resources.  We recognise the valuable work done by the Youth Service and will continue to give help to those voluntary bodies which make such a considerable contribution in this field.  PARENTS' RIGHTS AND RESPONSIBILITIES  Extending parents' rights and responsibilities, including their right of choice, will also help raise standards by giving them greater influence over education. Our Parents' Charter will place a clear duty on government and local authorities to take account of parents' wishes when allocating children to schools, with a local appeals system for those dissatisfied. Schools will be required to publish prospectuses giving details of their examination and other results.  The Direct Grant schools, abolished by Labour, gave wider opportunities for bright children from modest backgrounds. The Direct Grant principle will therefore be restored with an Assisted Places Scheme. Less well-off parents will be able to claim part or all of the fees at certain schools from a special government fund.  THE ARTS  Economic failure and Socialist policies have placed the arts under threat. Lightening the burden of tax should in time enable the private sponsor to flourish again and the reform of capital taxation will lessen the threat to our heritage. We will strengthen the existing provision whereby relief from CTT is available on assets placed in a maintenance fund for the support of heritage property. We favour the establishment of a National Heritage Fund to help preserve historic buildings and artistic treasures for the nation. We will continue to give as generous support to Britain's cultural and artistic life as the country can afford.  Sport and recreation have also been hit by inflation and high taxation. We will continue to support the Sports Councils in the encouragement of recreation and international sporting achievement.  HEALTH AND WELFARE  The welfare of the old, the sick, the handicapped and the deprived has also suffered under Labour. The lack of money to improve our social services and assist those in need can only be overcome by restoring the nation's prosperity. But some improvements can be made now by spending what we do have more sensibly.  In our National Health Service standards are falling; there is a crisis of morale; too often patients' needs do not come first. It is not our intention to reduce spending on the Health Service indeed, we intend to make better use of what resources are available. So we will simplify and decentralise the service and cut back bureaucracy.  When resources are so tightly stretched it is folly to turn good money away from the NHS and to discourage people from doing more for themselves. We shall therefore allow pay-beds to be provided where there is a demand for them; end Labour's vendetta against the private health sector; and restore tax relief on employer-employee medical insurance schemes. The Royal Commission on the Health Service is studying the financing of health care, and any examination of possible longer term changes - for example greater reliance for NHS funding on the insurance pnnciple - must await their report.  In the community, we must do more to help people to help themselves, and families to look after their own. We must also encourage the voluntary movement and self-help groups working in partnership with the statutory services.  MAKING SENSE OF SOCIAL SECURITY  Our social security system is now so complicated that even some Ministry officials do not understand it. Income tax starts at such a low level that many poor people are being taxed to pay for their own benefits. All too often they are little or no better off at work than they are on social security.  This was one of our principal reasons for proposing a tax credit scheme. Child benefits are a step in the right direction. Further progress will be very difficult in the next few years, both for reasons of cost and because of technical problems involved in the switch to computers. We shall wish to move towards the fulfilment of our original tax credit objectives as and when resources become available. Meanwhile we shall do all we can to find other ways to simplify the system, restore the incentive to work, reduce the poverty trap and bring more effective help to those in greatest need.  Restoring the will to work means, above all, cutting income tax. It also involves bringing unemployment and short-term sickness benefit within the tax system an objective fully shared by Labour Ministers. The rules about the unemployed accepting available jobs will be reinforced and we shall act more vigorously against fraud and abuse.  We welcomed the new Child Benefit as the first stage of our tax credit scheme. One-parent families face much hardship so we will maintain the special addition for them.  THE ELDERLY AND THE DISABLED  We will honour the increases in retirement pensions which were promised just before the election.  However, like others, pensioners have suffered from the high taxes and catastrophic inflation of Labour's years.  It is wrong to discourage people who wish to work after retirement age, and we will phase out the 'earnings rule' during the next Parliament. The Christmas Bonus, which the last Conservative government started in 1972, will continue. We will exempt war widows' pensions from tax and provide a pension for pre-1950 widows of 'other ranks' who do not receive one at present.  Much has been done in recent years to help the disabled, but there is still a long way to go. Our aim is to provide a coherent system of cash benefits to meet the costs of disability, so that more disabled people can support themselves and live normal lives. We shall work towards this as swiftly as the strength of the economy allows.  6. A STRONG BRITAIN IN A FREE WORLD  IMPROVING OUR DEFENCES  During the past five years the military threat to the West has grown steadily as the Communist bloc has established virtual parity in strategic nuclear weapons and a substantial superiority in conventional weapons. Yet Labour have cut down our forces, weakened our defences and reduced our contribution to NATO. And the Left are pressing for still more reductions.  We shall only be able to decide on the proper level of defence spending after consultation in government with the Chiefs of Staff and our allies. But it is already obvious that significant increases will be necessary. The SALT discussions increase the importance of ensuring the continuing effectiveness of Britain's nuclear deterrent.  In recent times our armed forces have had to deal with a wide variety of national emergencies. They have responded magnificently despite government neglect and a severe shortage of manpower and equipment. We will give our servicemen decent living conditions, bring their pay up to full comparability with their civilian counterparts immediately and keep it there. In addition, we must maintain the efficiency of our reserve forces. We will improve their equipment, too, and hope to increase their strength.  THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITY  If we wish to play our full part in shaping world events over the next few critical years, we must also work honestly and genuinely with our partners in the European Community. There is much that we can achieve together, much more than we can achieve alone.  There are some Community policies which need to be changed since they do not suit Britain's - or Europe's - best interests. But it is wrong to argue, as Labour do, that Europe has failed us. What has happened is that under Labour our country has been prevented from taking advantage of the opportunities which membership offers.  Labour's economic policies have blunted our competitive edge and made it more difficult for our companies to sell in our partners' markets. What is more, the frequently obstructive and malevolent attitude of Labour Ministers has weakened the Community as a whole and Britain's bargaining power within it.  By forfeiting the trust of our partners, Labour have made it much more difficult to persuade them to agree to the changes that are necessary in such important areas as the Common Agricultural Policy, the Community budget, and the proposed Common Fisheries Policy.  The next Conservative government will restore Britain's influence by convincing our partners of our commitment to the Community's success. This will enable us to protect British interests and to play a leading and constructive role in the Community's efforts to tackle the many problems which it faces.  We shall work for a common-sense Community which resists excessive bureaucracy and unnecessary harmonisation proposals, holding to the principles of free enterprise which inspired its original founders.  Our policies for the reform of the CAP (see Chapter 3) would reduce the burden which the Community budget places upon the British taxpayer. We shall also strive to cut out waste in other Community spending programmes.  National payments into the budget should be more closely related to ability to pay. Spending from the budget should be concentrated more strictly on policies and projects on which it makes sense for the Community rather than nation states to take the lead.  We attach particular importance to the co-ordination of Member States' foreign policies. In a world dominated by the super-powers, Britain and her partners are best able to protect their international interests and to contribute to world peace and stability when they speak with a single voice.  AFRICA AND THE MIDDLE EAST  In Africa and the Middle East, there is an increasing threat from the Soviet Union and its Cuban allies. That threat must be countered, not only through collaboration with our European and American allies but also by the people and governments in Africa and the Middle East whose independence is threatened.  We shall do all we can to build on the Egyptian/Israeli peace treaty, to seek a comprehensive settlement which will bring peace to the whole region.  RHODESIA  The Conservative Party will aim to achieve a lasting settlement to the Rhodesia problem based on the democratic wishes of the people of that country. If the Six Principles, which all British governments have supported for the last fifteen years, are fully satisfied following the present Rhodesian Election, the next government will have the duty to return Rhodesia to a state of legality, move to lift sanctions, and do its utmost to ensure that the new independent state gains international recognition.  TRADE, AID AND THE COMMONWEALTH  Like other industrial countries, Britain has a vital interest in bringing prosperity to poorer nations which provide us with a growing market and supply many of the raw materials upon which we depend. The next Conservative government will help them through national and international programmes of aid and technical co-operation and by the encouragement of voluntary work. But we also attach particular importance to the development of trade and private investment through such instruments as the European Community's Lomé Convention. In particular, we will foster all our Commonwealth links and seek to harness to greater cifret the collective influence of the Commonwealth in world affairs.  7. A NEW BEGINNING  IN THIS MANIFESTO we have not sought to understate the difficulties which face us-the economic and social problems at home, the threats to the freedom of the West abroad. Yet success and security are attainable if we have the courage and confidence to seize the opportunities which are open to us.  We make no lavish promises. The repeated disappointment of rising expectations has led to a marked loss of faith in politicians' promises. Too much has gone wrong in Britain for us to hope to put it all right in a year or so. Many things will simply have to wait until the economy has been revived and we are once again creating the wealth on which so much else depends.  Most people, in their hearts, know that Britain has to come to terms with reality. They no longer have any time for politicians who try to gloss over the harsh facts of life. Most people want to be told the truth, and to be given a clear lead towards the action needed for recovery.  The years of make-believe and false optimism are over. It is time for a new beginning."

DEFENCE POLICY THE COMMONWEALTH AND THE DEVELOPING WORLD THE LAW OF THE SEA NEAR AND MIDDLE EAST AFRICA LATIN AMERICA FALKLAND ISLANDS ASIA HUMAN RIGHTS  Foreword  Here you can read Labour's plan to do the things crying out to be done in our country today.  To get Britain back to work. To rebuild our shattered industries. To get rid of the ever-growing dole queues. To protect and enlarge our National Health Service and our other great social services. To help stop the nuclear arms race. Here you can see what Labour is determined to do, and how we shall set about it.  But at once the objection is raised: Can we afford it? Where will the money come from? Are we not just making promises which cannot be fulfilled?  You will find the detailed answers here. But let us emphasise a few of them at once.  The first short, sharp answer is that what Britain cannot afford is the present policy of accepting mass unemployment.  Mass unemployment on the scale Mrs. Thatcher and her government have been prepared to tolerate - worse than we have ever known before and worse than any other industrial country has experienced - imposes a crushing burden on the whole community.  Of course it hits hardest the young denied work altogether, and their mothers and fathers thrown out of their jobs with little chance of getting another.  But it also hits the whole country.  Mass unemployment costs the country &pound;15 billion, &pound;16 billion, &pound;17 billion a year, astronomic figures never conceived possible before, and they move higher still every month.  Mass unemployment is the main reason why most families in Britain, all but the very rich, are paying more in taxes today than they did four years ago when the Conservatives promised to cut them for everybody.  Mass unemployment is the main reason why we are wasting our precious North Sea oil riches. Since 1979 Mrs. Thatcher's government has had the benefit of &pound;20 billion in tax revenues from the North Sea. It has all been swallowed by the huge, mounting cost of mass unemployment. And the oil won't last for ever, although, according to Mrs. Thatcher's economics, the unemployment will.  Our country, no civilised country, can afford the human waste, the industrial and economic waste, involved in these policies. We in the Labour Party reject them absolutely, and we describe in this Manifesto the real constructive alternative, and how we shall pay for it.  See, first, our Emergency Programme of Action to be started immediately we are given the power. Most of these measures are designed to start the drive for expansion, and the cost of them has been added up. How fast can the country escape for the present stagnant rut?  That is the real question.  Just a week before Sir Geoffrey Howe, the Tory Chancellor, produced his last Budget to keep us in the rut, Peter Shore, Labour's Shadow Chancellor, produced his budget for expansion.  The costs he set out - an &pound;11 billion expansion - would cover, as they were designed to cover, the items we have listed in the Emergency Programme, the promises we have tabulated.  So little is it true that Labour has not counted the cost. No party in opposition has ever stated its intentions so clearly and comprehensively.  Then what happens? What happens after the first expansion is launched? Here in these pages we describe the conditions for success, the pace we can move forward, how that will depend on the response we can secure from all sections of the community, on the partnership we have established with the trade unions. Without that continuing partnership to rebuild our country, all else will fail. True enough; but Labour is the only party which has worked for this partnership and pledges it for the future.  And where will the money come from? Some of it will come from those oil revenues now pouring down the drain. Some of it will come from the billions we waste on the dole queues. Some of it will come from the billions now being allowed to be exported in investment abroad.  Yes, and some of it will be borrowed, Mrs. Thatcher's dirty word.  But borrowing in that sense is what every intelligent government since the war in Britain has done - including even Conservative governments. Borrowing in that sense is what has been done by other governments in this world slump who have kept their unemployment much lower than ours - and their inflation rates low too.  Of course the slump can be beaten, if we have the will and the right policies. The European governments which have survived it best have been mostly socialist governments rejecting Thatcherite nostrums. And the whole wider experience of the Western world since 1945 proves what can be done when governments set before them full employment as a target. Is it truly realistic and practical to cast all that knowledge aside?  It is just not true that mass unemployment must be accepted.  Rather, if nothing can be done about unemployment, nothing truly enduring can be done about anything else. Allow it to persist and it will corrode the rest of our society. It will make more deeply endemic than ever the injustices, the bitter hardships, which afflict so many of our people.  So let's put a stop to defeatism, and put a stop too to all those sermons about Victorian values. The labour movement - the Labour Party and the trade unions acting together - came into being, as one of our poets, Idris Davies, said, to end ""the long Victorian night"". It was a fight to introduce civilised standards into the world of ruthless, devil-take-the-hindmost individualism.  Particularly after our 1945 victory, when Labour had a majority, we set to work creating a real community in which the strong would come to the aid of the weak, in which the profit test would have to make way for the human test.  It was the Labour Party which created - to take just one example - the National Health Service, in the teeth of bitter Tory opposition. Labour will come to the rescue of that service and make it worthy of those who founded it, those who serve it, and the patients who need it most of all. It is a commonsense example of democratic socialism in action.  Of course, we know that the full work of rebuilding will not be easy. Of course we know that, thanks to world conditions and the Conservative years of destruction and decay, our task is made much harder.  But the programme of socialist reconstruction outlined in these pages, can be carried through if a Labour government commands the support of the other great democratic institutions in the land - in particular the local authorities and the trade unions.  Labour is the only party which desires and can secure the working partnership between the government and the trade unions essential to national recovery.  Above all, the new Labour government will play a much more ambitious part in helping to guide the nation towards peace, and, as an essential part of the process, in establishing a sensible defence policy for our country.  One bunch of smears and scares with which Tory propagandists have already disfigured this election campaign suggests that the Labour Party proposes to throw away our defences, to abandon our alliances.  It is just not true. And it should not be forgotten that one of the last acts of Mrs. Thatcher's government was to stop the debate in the House of Commons when these slanders could have been nailed.  What we do propose to do is to get rid of the nuclear boomerangs which offer no genuine protection to our people but, first and foremost, to help stop the nuclear arms race which is the most dangerous threat to us all.  One of the most wretched features of the present government's record has been the low interest they have devoted to the work of securing international disarmament. No British initiative of any significance in this field has been taken.  Instead, the programme for establishing American-controlled Cruise missiles on our soil has been accepted without question, and the Trident programme for the expansion of the British-controlled nuclear forces has been accepted without reference to the possibilities of disarmament.  Indeed, the logic of the case for the nuclear deterrent, presented by British Conservative Ministers, is that all peace-loving countries should equip themselves with the same protection. It is a logic which would intensify the race and destroy the universe.  The first task of a new Labour government will be to restore a sense of sanity in dealing with these supreme questions. We offer a combined programme of action by this country and of action in association with other countries.  We are the only party that offers such a programme to meet the scale of the challenge. We are the only party that offers a non-nuclear defence policy.  But we are not alone in our plans and our aspirations. Multitudes of people in many other lands, on both sides of the Atlantic, in Asia and Africa and Europe too, are ready to join us in the campaign for a nuclear freeze, for fresh exertions to stop the proliferation of these weapons, to stop the whole monstrous nuclear race to destruction.  MICHAEL FOOT  In this campaign document we set out Labour's alternative to mass unemployment. We explain how a Labour government will help to stop the nuclear arms race. We provide a radical programme of action, for a full, five-year parliament, to save British industry and rebuild the welfare state.  The years of Tory failure  When the Tories took office in May 1979, unemployment was falling and the economy growing. Living standards had gone up by a sixth in two years, and North Sea oil held out the prospect of economic growth, high levels of employment and better social services.  All this was thrown away by the Tories. Nearly three and a quarter million men and women are now out of work, even on the official count. Plant after plant forced to close. Manufacturing production down by a fifth. Investment cut by a third. Our domestic markets captured by imports of manufactured goods.  After four years of Mrs. Thatcher, Britain is a poorer country. We have fared far worse than any other major industrial country. The unprecedented advantage of North Sea oil and gas - worth, in tax revenues alone, 8p in the pound on income tax - has been squandered, with nothing whatsoever to show for it.  What have all these sacrifices achieved? Our economy today is weaker, not stronger, than in 1979. There is no prospect of real economic growth. Indeed, the Tories no longer dare to predict when unemployment will begin to fall. True enough, inflation, after being forced to record levels by the Tories, has been brought down. But look at the cost in jobs, in poorer housing, in living standards, and in lost opportunities for our youth. And now inflation is set to increase again, with interest rates and mortgage rates likely to rise too.  The legacy of four Tory years goes beyond unemployment and industrial decline; beyond the damage done to our social services; beyond even the dangerous commitment to new nuclear weapons. It is expressed in the deep sense of bitterness, distrust and despair now felt among so many sections of the community. Our task will be to heal these wounds and rekindle among the British people a new sense of unity and common purpose.  Emergency programme of action  Within days of taking office, Labour will begin to implement an emergency programme of action, to bring about a complete change of direction for Britain. Our priority will be to create jobs and give a new urgency to the struggle for peace. In many cases we will be able to act immediately. In others, which involve legislation, they will take longer to bring into effect. But in all cases we shall act swiftly and with determination.  This is what we plan to do. We will:  - LAUNCH A MASSIVE PROGRAMME FOR EXPANSION. We will:  - Provide a major increase in public investment, including transport, housing and energy conservation.  - Begin a huge programme of construction, so that we can start to build our way out of the slump.  - Halt the destruction of our social services and begin to rebuild them, by providing a substantial increase in resources.  - Increase investment in industry, especially in new technology - with public enterprise taking the lead. And we will steer new industry and jobs to the regions and the inner cities.  - Ensure that the pound is competitive; and hold back prices through action on VAT, rents, rates and fares.  - Introduce a crash programme of employment and training, with new job subsidies and allowances.  - BEGIN TO REBUILD BRITISH INDUSTRY, working within a new framework for planning and industrial democracy. We will:  - Agree a new national economic assessment, setting out the prospects for growth in the economy.  - Prepare a five-year national plan, in consultation with unions and employers. Back up these steps with a new National Investment Bank, new industrial powers, and a new Department for Economic and Industrial Planning.  - Repeal Tory legislation on industrial relations and make provision for introducing industrial democracy.  - Begin the return to public ownership of those public industries sold off by the Tories.  - START TO CREATE A FAIRER BRITAIN, with decent social services for all. We will:  - Raise child benefits by &pound;2 a week, and give special help to one-parent families and families with disabled dependants.  - Uprate the pension in November 1983 by the full amount needed to protect against inflation; and increase pensions by &pound;1.45 a week for a single person and &pound;2.25 for a married couple.  - Provide more resources for the health service with an increase of at least 3 per cent a year in real terms.  - Improve the personal social services, such as meals on wheels and home helps, with an increase of at least 4 per cent a year in real terms.  - Spend more on education, including on essential books and equipment; end the assisted places scheme; and stop selection in secondary schools.  - Begin to develop comprehensive care for the under-fives.  - Begin to develop a strategy to eliminate low pay.  - INTRODUCE POSITIVE ACTION PROGRAMMES TO PROMOTE WOMEN'S RIGHTS AND OPPORTUNITIES, and appoint a cabinet minister to promote equality between the sexes. We will:  - Strengthen the Equal Pay Act and the Sex Discrimination Act.  - Improve child care and other social services.  - Take steps to end discrimination in education and training.  - Reverse Tory cuts in maternity rights.  - Increase the maternity grant.  - Encourage and assist local authorities to begin a massive programme of HOUSE-BUILDING AND IMPROVEMENT, through an immediate 50 per cent increase in their housing investment programmes. Priority will go to the urgent repair and replacement of run-down estates. We will freeze all rents for the first full year.  - Begin a major programme to stop the waste of ENERGY. We will stop Sizewell and abandon the Tory PWR programme; and open urgent discussions, with the unions and management in the coal industry, on a new Plan for Coal.  - GIVE MORE HELP TO PUBLIC TRANSPORT, with funds to improve services, keep down fares, and increase investment - especially in rail electrification and better freight facilities. Councils will be given new powers to support local services.  - Act to IMPROVE THE ENVIRONMENT AND DEAL WITH POLLUTION - including a ban on lead in petrol. An urgent start will be made on improving our inner cities, including action on derelict land and buildings.  - Introduce a positive action programme for the ETHNIC MINORITIES. We will also introduce citizenship and immigration laws which do not discriminate against either women or black and Asian Britons.  - Give a new priority to OPEN GOVERNMENT at local and national levels, and give local communities greater freedom to manage their own affairs. We will also introduce an early Bill to abolish the legislative powers of the House of Lords.  - In INTERNATIONAL POLICY, we shall take new initiatives to promote peace and development. We will:  - Cancel the Trident programme, refuse to deploy Cruise missiles and begin discussions for the removal of nuclear bases from Britain, which is to be completed within the lifetime of the Labour government.  - Ban arms sales to repressive regimes.  - Increase aid to developing countries towards the UN target of 0.7 per cent.  - Re-establish a separate Ministry of Overseas Development.  - Take action to protect the status of refugees in Britain.  - We will also open immediate negotiations with our EEC partners, and introduce the necessary legislation, to prepare for BRITAIN'S WITHDRAWAL FROM THE EEC, to be completed well within the lifetime of the Labour government.  A FIVE-YEAR PROGRAMME  Labour's emergency programme of action will get Britain on the road to recovery. But on its own it will not be enough to establish a fairer, more prosperous, more caring Britain.  The programme we set out in the pages which follow is, therefore, for a full, five-year term of office. Clearly, we cannot do everything at once. The economy has been dangerously weakened by the Tories, and Britain is considerably poorer than when we were last in government. The world recession could hamper our plans for economic revival.  Moreover, our proposals add up to a considerable increase in public spending. Our programme is thus heavily dependent upon the achievement of our basic objectives: namely, a large and sustained increase in the nation's output and income and a matching decline in the numbers out of work. It is this that will make the resources available for higher public spending programmes and cut the enormous cost of unemployment. Even so, some of our commitments will be phased in over a number of years. At each stage, clearly, we shall have to choose carefully our priorities.  ENDING MASS UNEMPLOYMENT  The present hideous level of unemployment is not an accident It is the direct result of the policies of this government. The Tories have cut public investment and services, and increased taxes, taking spending power out of the economy and destroying jobs in both public and private sectors alike. They have forced up interest rates and kept the pound too high - a combination that has crippled British industry, and helped lose us markets at home and abroad.  Our approach is different. We will expand the economy, by providing a strong and measured increase in spending. Spending money creates jobs. Money spent on railway electrification means jobs, not only in construction, but also in the industries that supply the equipment - as well as faster and better trains. If we increase pensions and child benefits, it means more spending power for the elderly and for parents, more bought in shops, more orders for goods, and more jobs in the factories. More spending means that the economy will begin to expand: and growth will provide the new wealth for higher wages and better living standards, the right climate for industry to invest, and more resources for the public services.  Our central aim will be to reduce unemployment to below a million within five years of taking office. We recognise the enormous scale of this task. When we set this as our target, unemployment was 2.8 million, according to the official figures. On this basis it is now at least 3.2 million. Our target will thus be all the more difficult to achieve. It remains, however, the central objective of our economic policy.  To achieve it we will need five years of economic growth, with a Labour government carrying through all of the industrial, financial and economic policies outlined here. But we will also work with other governments - especially socialist governments - to bring about a co-ordinated expansion of our economies.  Economic expansion will make it possible to end the waste of mass unemployment. But it will also reduce the HUMAN costs of unemployment - the poverty, the broken homes, the increase in illness and suicides. And it will provide the resources we need to increase social spending, as we MUST, at least in line with the growth of the economy.  HOW WILL WE PAY FOR IT?  Given our commitment to increase public spending, it is right that people should ask: how will we pay for it?  It would be wrong to finance the INITIAL boost to spending by increasing taxation. Only if ours was a fully employed economy would this be the right way of doing it. But our economy today is chronically under-employed. We have people out of work, idle plant, and unused savings. To finance expansion by increasing taxation in these circumstances would be wrong. For the increased spending in one part of the economy would be cancelled out by decreased expenditure elsewhere. Of course, once the economy gets much nearer to full employment, some taxes WILL have to be increased, both to shift the tax balance towards those who can best afford to pay, and to help finance our social programme.  Like any other expanding industrial enterprise, we shall borrow to finance our programme of investment. This is better than borrowing, as the Tories are doing, in order to pay for the dole queue or to provide finance for the Argentine government to buy arms.  There is no shortage of savings in the country available for borrowing today. Indeed, vast amounts of British money - more than the government's total borrowing requirement last year - are flowing into overseas investment. For with our present slump, there is not the demand for investment here.  But the scale of borrowing will not be nearly as great as the increase in spending. Spending generates new income and new savings. As the economy recovers we shall be able to spend less on keeping people unemployed. And when people get jobs they will also pay income tax and spend more on goods which are taxed. Last year benefit payments, and tax revenues foregone - because of unemployment - cost the nation some &pound;17,000 million. There are also important savings to be made by cancelling the present government 5 massive expenditure programmes on Trident and on PWR nuclear reactors.  WORKING TOGETHER  At the heart of our programme is Labour's new partnership with the trade unions. Our policies have been worked out with them. The Tories take pride in rejecting any chance of constructive co-operation with the trade unions. But it is the nation that has paid the price - the economy in ruins, and industrial relations a battlefield. We believe that there is a better way: to harness the goodwill and co-operation of working people and to work together to create a better life for all.  Our starting point in government will be to discuss and agree with the trade unions a NATIONAL ECONOMIC ASSESSMENT, as described in our joint statement with the TUC, Partners in Rebuilding Britain. This will set out the likely growth in the national output and how it could be shared. It will cover the allocation of resources, and the distribution of income between profits, earnings from employment, rents, social benefits and other incomes. It will also take into account our policies on the redistribution of income and wealth, not least through the reform of taxation. It will take a view on what changes in costs and prices would be compatible with our economic and social objectives, and help to ensure that our plan for expansion is not undermined by inflation. We will not, however, return to the old policies of government-imposed wage restraint. The assessment will thus play a crucial part in our national plan.  The assessment will also play an important role in Labour's plans for the redistribution of wealth and power in our society. For, as we emphasise in Labour's Programme, our aim is nothing less than to bring about 'A FUNDAMENTAL AND IRREVERSIBLE SHIFT IN THE BALANCE OF POWER AND WEALTH IN FAVOUR OF WORKING PEOPLE AND THEIR FAMILIES'.  AN OFFENSIVE AGAINST LOW PAY  The next Labour government will launch an offensive against low pay as part of our strategy for equality. The problem of low pay remains acute both in relative and absolute terms. If low pay at present is defined as less than two-thirds of average male manual earnings, there were 3 million full-time low-paid workers in 1982, of whom over 2 million were women workers. Adding to these figures young workers, part-time workers and homeworkers produces a total in the region of almost 6 million - a great majority of whom are women.  We will work together with the unions to tackle low pay and extend the concept of fair wages and arbitration. We will strengthen the Equal Pay Act. We strongly emphasise the principles of fairness and proper comparability, and will ensure machinery is available for the trade unions to establish these principles. We will also discuss with the TUC the possibility of introducing a minimum wage.  INDUSTRIAL DEMOCRACY  Industrial democracy is vital to the success of the national plan. We believe that working people must have clear and definite rights to a say in running their firms - and to an influence in economic planning. We will give new statutory rights to workers - through their trade unions - on information, consultation and representation within their companies. These are described in our joint statement with the TUC, Economic Planning and Industrial Democracy. But we will work out with the unions concerned what this means for the individual industries and firms.  We will repeal the divisive Tory 'employment' laws and provide new statutory support for collective bargaining. We will also give proper employment protection to women and to homeworkers, part-time workers and temporary workers.  The Tories' cut-backs in the work of the Health and Safety Commission will be reversed. Labour will actively support the commission and the role of joint safety committees in the work place.  SAFEGUARDS FOR EXPANSION  Increased spending will not be enough to ensure sustained economic growth. Spending will not create jobs if it is soaked up by imports. We must not allow firms to use a return to growth as an excuse to put up prices. It will, in addition, be essential to co-ordinate expansion so proper investment is made for the future.  First, we will see that our financial and monetary policies support expansion. We will make sure that public borrowing is financed, through the financial institutions and national savings, without disruptive or damaging changes in interest rates.  Second, exchange controls - maintained by successive British governments since 1939; and so foolishly scrapped by the Tories in 1979 - will be re-introduced. This will help to counter currency speculation and to make available - to industry and government in Britain - the large capital resources that are now flowing overseas.  Third, we must ensure that our trade and balance of payments contribute to our expansion. This means maintaining the pound at a realistic and competitive rate. Tory monetary policies have kept interest rates far too high, pushing the pound beyond its competitive value. An overpriced pound taxes exports and subsidises imports. Our balance of trade, other than North Sea oil, has been seriously damaged as a result. A competitive exchange rate will assist British exports abroad and make British goods more competitive at home.  A POLICY FOR IMPORTS  But we must also plan ahead so that, as the economy expands, we keep our exports and imports in balance. We must therefore be ready to act on imports DIRECTLY: first, in order to safeguard key industries that have been seriously put at risk by Tory policy; and second, so as to check the growth of imports should they threaten to outstrip our exports and thus our plan for expansion. We will:  - Use agreed development plans, which we shall negotiate with the large companies that dominate our economy, so as to influence their purchasing and development policies. Our aim will be to prevent excessive import penetration and promote our own exports.  - Use public purchasing policy to help support our strategy.  - Introduce back-up import controls, using tariffs and quotas, if these prove necessary, to achieve our objective of trade balance - upon which sustained expansion depends.  Our purpose in trade policy is NOT to reduce trade but to make possible an orderly expansion of imports, paid for by our growing export trade. We will thus be able to replace the present policies of deflation, which RESTRICT world trade, by policies of expansion, which INCREASE world trade. We will also encourage international action for expansion and increased world trade.  Within the framework of an orderly expansion of trade, we will also seek to give real preferences to imports from developing countries, particularly from the poorest countries, except where this will create acute problems for particular industries in this country.  PRICES - CONTROLLING INFLATION  The Tories have used mass unemployment to control inflation. We completely reject this approach. We believe it is madness to keep people out of work deliberately. OUR priority will be to expand the economy and create jobs. But we are also determined to prevent soaring prices. Expansion will in itself help cut the costs of production and therefore hold back prices. But we will use other measures to help restrain inflation. We will:  - USE DIRECT MEASURES OF PRICE RESTRAINT, such as cutting VAT, and subsidies on basic products, to cut into inflation as and when necessary.  - STOP USING PUBLIC SECTOR CHARGES, such as gas prices - up by 116 per cent since 1979 - as a back-door way of raising taxes, as the Tories have done.  - BUY OUR FOOD WHERE IT IS CHEAPER, on world markets, following Britain's withdrawal from the EEC.  - GIVE POWERS TO A NEW PRICE COMMISSION to investigate companies, monitor price increases and order price freezes and reductions. These controls will be closely linked to our industrial planning, through agreed development plans with the leading, price-setting firms.  - Take full account of these measures in the NATIONAL ECONOMIC ASSESSMENT, to be agreed each year with the trade unions. The assessment will also take account of the impact of cost increases on the future rate of inflation.  VALUE FOR MONEY  The Tories say that 'competition' ensures that shoppers get a fair deal. The customers know better. Stronger legal safeguards are essential to protect customers - not least from shoddy goods. And shoppers must KNOW their rights and be able to enforce them. We will undertake an urgent and comprehensive review of consumer law and reform it. We will also bring in new safeguards on advertising. We will:  - Establish a major public service facility - a Product Research Unit - to test products and manufacturers' claims about them, and to publicise the results widely.  - Set up consumer advice centres in all main shopping centres, with mobile units for rural areas.  - Provide simple court procedures for small claims, stronger trade codes of practice placed on to a statutory basis, and adequate penalties for trading offences.  - See that all public enterprises give a high priority to dealing with consumer complaints and needs - and back them with stronger consumer councils.  - Introduce a code of advertising practice, on a statutory basis, to be administered by the office of Fair Trading; and provide powers to order advertisements to be substantiated, withdrawn, or corrected with equal prominence.  REBUILDING OUR INDUSTRY  The Tories have been a disaster for British industry. Plants and companies have closed, skilled workers have been laid off, markets at home and abroad have been lost to our competitors. Industry has not invested enough, and it has failed to develop and exploit the new technologies as successfully as other industrial countries.  We must rebuild our industrial strength - and we can do so under a Labour Government working together with unions and managers, to plan Britain's industrial development. Our aim is not just to save companies and factories from closing down. We intend to create NEW companies and NEW science-based industries - using new public enterprise to lead the way, and supported by the development of industrial democracy.  In our joint statement with the TUC, Economic Planning and Industrial Democracy, and in Labour's Programme 1982, we show how it can be done. We will:  - Develop a new five-year national plan to coordinate expansion and public spending with plans for individual industries and regions. We will create a powerful new Department of Economic and Industrial Planning.  - Involve the trade unions and management in planning at every level with a new, tripartite National Planning Council.  - Link planning at all levels firmly to a radical extension of industrial democracy. New statutory rights will enable workers to draw up plans for their own enterprises and sectors of industry, which we will seek to incorporate into our strategy.  - Make our planning flexible, so that it is able to respond quickly to changing circumstances and take full account of changing needs and preferences. We are opposed to any kind of rigid planning from the centre. But we WILL seek to develop a firm sense of strategic direction.  - Negotiate agreed development plans with all leading companies - national and multinational, public and private - so that such companies play a constructive role in supporting the national plan and our plans for individual regions and sectors.  - Support these agreed development plans with new industrial powers, including discretionary price controls, financial support and access to credit; and take powers to invest in individual companies, to purchase them outright or to assume temporary control.  - Monitor closely the activities of multinational companies, through a Foreign Investment Unit. All UK-based multinationals will have to operate within clearly laid-down guidelines.  - Develop regional development plans, with plans also being drawn up at local level by local authorities. Regional development agencies will be established, extending our present commitment to a Northern Development Agency to other English regions in need of them. These agencies will have similar powers and resources to those in Scotland and Wales. We will also consider using new regional job subsidies.  - Strengthen the NEB, the Scottish and Welsh Development Agencies, and the Industrial Development Board in Northern Ireland. We will give them, and the NEW development agencies, adequate resources for investment and acquisition.  PUBLIC AND CO-OPERATIVE ENTERPRISE  We will use public and co-operative enterprise to support our planning and as a major source of technical innovation. We will:  - Encourage and help EXISTING public enterprises to expand and diversify. They will be given far more freedom to raise funds on capital markets.  - Return to public ownership the public assets and rights hived off by the Tories, with compensation of no more than that received when the assets were denationalised. We will establish a significant public stake in electronics, pharmaceuticals, health equipment and building materials; and also in other important sectors, as required in the national interest.  - Give generous encouragement and help to worker co-operatives and local enterprise boards. We will establish a Co-operative Investment Bank. The development agencies and local authorities will be empowered to support and to help establish co operatives and local enterprise boards. We will give new rights to workers to convert their firms into co-operatives.  Labour will also support key industries in the public sector. We will:  - Prevent the further decline of both public and private sectors of the STEEL INDUSTRY so that the industry can, through planned investment, meet the rising demand from economic expansion. We will retain the five major BSC plants and see that a larger share of the home market is met from UK production. A major public presence will also be established in the steel stock-holding industry.  - Develop our AEROSPACE INDUSTRIES. We will ensure that proper levels of research, development and investment take place, and that the industries have the capacity and skills needed to compete as equals in the world market. The British Aerospace Corporation will be re-established as a major public enterprise.  - Support the SHIPBUILDING INDUSTRY, which is vital for a maritime nation such as Britain, with interests in merchant shipping, the Navy, offshore oil and gas resources and fishing. Labour will establish a maritime strategy embracing both shipbuilding and shipping interests. We will re establish the British Shipbuilding Corporation as a public sector company with a new financial basis and adequate resources for investment.  TELECOMMUNICATIONS  A national cable system will make possible a wide range of new telecommunications services, greater variety in the provision of television, and a major stimulus to British technology and industry. But it must be under firm public control. A publicly-owned British Telecommunications will thus be given the sole responsibility to create a national, broadband network (including Mercury, the new privately-owned telecommunications system for business), which integrates telecommunications and broadcasting.  SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY  Science and technology are essential to Britain's economic and social regeneration. The Tories have undermined research and development in the science-based research industries of the future. Cuts in higher education threaten our fundamental research. Industry devotes less to research and development than any other of our major industrial competitors. Defence accounts for over 80 per cent of government research funds in industry.  The fall in output, together with the lack of planning and retraining, has meant that new technology has brought major job losses in some sectors. Only Labour can plan new technology to meet our commitment to full employment. We will:  - Guarantee adequate funding for higher education, the research councils and government research establishments.  - Use the National Investment Bank to channel funds from the financial institutions into long-term investment in new technology.  - Work together with trade unions to plan an expansion of new technology, in particular using it to aid a product-based recovery of the economy. New technology agreements, for proper safeguards and retraining for the work-force, will be extended.  - Strengthen the links between research by higher education and industry to help greater industrial innovation.  - Increase technological literacy in schools and give boys and girls equal opportunities to study science and technology.  - Promote the supply of engineers and technicians, including women, to meet the needs of industry and the community.  - Ensure that research and development are directed towards society's needs, with a reduction in the present high proportion of defence research.  - Promote the development and use of new information and communication services to support a wider democracy.  FINANCE FOR INDUSTRY  It is essential that industry has the finance it needs to support our plans for increased investment. Our proposals are set out in full in our Conference statement, The Financial Institutions. We will:  - Establish a National Investment Bank to put new resources from private institutions and from the government - including North Sea oil revenues - on a large scale into our industrial priorities. The bank will attract and channel savings, by agreement, in a way that guarantees these savings and improves the quality of investment in the UK.  - Exercise, through the Bank of England, much closer direct control over bank lending. Agreed development plans will be concluded with the banks and other financial institutions.  - Create a public bank operating through post offices, by merging the National Girobank, National Savings Bank and the Paymaster General's Office.  - Set up a Securities Commission to regulate the institutions and markets of the City, including Lloyds, within a clear statutory framework.  - Introduce a new Pension Schemes Act to strengthen members' rights in occupational pension schemes, clarify the role of trustees, and give members a right to equal representation, through their trade unions, on controlling bodies of the schemes.  - Set up a tripartite investment monitoring agency to advise trustees and encourage improvements in investment practices and strategies.  We expect the major clearing banks to co operate with us fully on these reforms, in the national interest. However, should they fail to do so, we shall stand ready to take one or more of them into public ownership. This will not in any way affect the integrity of customers' deposits.  EMPLOYMENT AND TRAINING  The long-term unemployed - the men and women who have suffered most from the Tory onslaught - will benefit directly from economic expansion and our policies on regional development. But special measures are also needed. By the end of our first five years, our aim is that no-one will be out of work for more than a year without receiving an offer of a job or training place.  We will act quickly to save jobs and stop the further destruction of industry. We will expand the schemes for compensating firms that avoid redundancy and provide temporary jobs for the long-term unemployed. We will widen the Job Release Scheme and offer employment subsidies to firms, linked to agreements with them to preserve and create jobs. We will also provide major increases in youth and adult training, with special provision for women, ethnic minorities and the disabled; and integrate a reformed Youth Training Scheme into our scheme for a two-year student-traineeship.  Industry has been badly hit by the collapse of training under the Tories. Expansion must not be held back by shortages of skilled labour; and people without work must have the skills needed to take up the available jobs. We will:  - Introduce a new statutory framework, linking adult training with initial training. This will also place a statutory duty on employers to carry out training and establish joint workplace training committees. Adequate funds will be provided jointly by industry and government.  - Give the Manpower Services Commission the authority and resources it needs to do the job. The commission will develop its regional and local structures, advise companies on their plans for manpower, and get advance notice of redundancies.  - Ensure that the MSC develops a national job centre network and reverses the cutbacks in occupational guidance and help for disadvantaged job seekers. We will take urgent steps to abolish private employment agencies.  Working time in Britain, over the life time of individual workers, is among the highest in industrial countries. We will work through collective bargaining to reduce working time; and this will include more flexible working arrangements, more time off for study, longer holidays, earlier voluntary retirement with adequate pensions - with progress towards our aim of a common pension age of 60 - and a 35 hour week.  EQUAL RIGHTS AT WORK  Labour's aim is to create equal rights at work for women and to overcome the effects of past discrimination. We will:  - Expand Positive Action Programmes to eliminate discrimination, change employment practices and introduce special training schemes to equip women to enter non-traditional areas of work.  - Carry out these programmes throughout the public sector, ensure that public-sector contracts include a commitment to positive action, and press employers and unions to negotiate these programmes through joint equal opportunities committees at the workplace. These proposals will be backed, if necessary, by a statutory duty on employers.  - Strengthen the Sex Discrimination and Equal Pay Acts to make them more effective. We will shift the burden of proof from the complainant to the alleged discriminator, incorporate the concept of indirect discrimination and introduce the principle of equal pay for work of equal value.  - End the distinction between part-time and full-time workers in terms of rights, hourly pay-rates and conditions, and extend greater employment protection to homeworkers and women on maternity leave.  We also aim to create equality of opportunity and treatment for black workers, and similar positive action programmes will be carried through on their behalf.  ENERGY  Energy is vital to our future as an industrial nation. We will plan its supply and demand more carefully and save more of the energy we use. As outlined in Labour's Programme 1982, we will:  - Ensure that everyone can afford adequate heat and light at home.  - Give priority to the coal industry and the use of coal as a fuel. We will seek to re-establish the tripartite machinery set up under Labour and prepare a new Plan for Coal. We will also replace old plant with coal-fired stations.  - Assist major towns and cities to set up combined heat and power schemes.  - Begin a massive CONSERVATION programme, led by insulation for council housing, and giving incentives to industry on agreed plans to save energy. The programme will be managed by a new Energy Conservation Agency.  - Greatly increase spending on the development of renewable sources.  - Stop Sizewell and scrap the Tory PWR programme. The need for a continuing nuclear programme based on the British AGR will be reassessed when we come to office.  - Re-establish the Energy Commission to advise on the preparation and annual review of a comprehensive energy plan.  - Transfer the whole of the National Nuclear Corporation to the public sector.  Energy costs now represent a major part of family budgets. We will aim to reduce these costs, both by conservation and by introducing new fuel allowances.  We will bring Britoil back into public ownership and combine it with BNOC to create a powerful national oil corporation with full powers to engage in all aspects of oil-related activities. We will restore to the new corporation a minimum 50 per cent stake in all fields discovered since 1975; and, in line with our objective to bring North Sea oil into public ownership and control, the public sector will have the dominant role in all future oil and gas exploration and development in the North Sea. We reaffirm our commitment to achieving full public control and ownership of British Petroleum, in order to make it an effective agent of a nationally directed oil policy.  FOOD, FISHING AND AGRICULTURE  Britain needs a food and agriculture policy much more in line with our needs - and this is one of the prime reasons for leaving the EEC. Instead of the inflated prices of the EEC's Common Agricultural Policy, we will support our agriculture through deficiency payments - coupled, where necessary, with limited intervention buying and direct income support.  As we describe in Labour's Programme 1982, we will conduct an 'annual assessment' of the industry, after consultation with all those concerned. This will set the level of support given to the industry. Labour will also negotiate long-term supply agreements with agricultural producing nations; establish commodity agencies and support marketing co-operatives; and, where helpful, extend marketing boards to other sectors.  Together with the trade unions we will work to close the gap between agricultural and industrial earnings, and replace the Agricultural Wages Board with a statutory joint industrial council. We will also act to improve farm safety, provide statutory support for workers' safety representatives, and end pay discrimination against women workers.  We will give a new deal to the FISHING INDUSTRY. We will draw up a National Fisheries Plan so as to take full advantage of our withdrawal from the EEC. We will also provide public investment for the industry and improved conditions of employment - including safety conditions - and introduce a licensing system for registered fishing vessels and fishermen.  We will end the de-rating of agricultural land. We will also defend the AGRICULTURAL ENVIRONMENT by giving a new priority to the effect on the environment of our agricultural policies. We will make all agricultural aid subject to environmental criteria and extend development controls to agriculture.  We shall take tougher measures to control the use of pesticides and herbicides. We shall establish a body with statutory powers to supervise their use, and in particular we shall ban the use of 245-T. We shall strengthen controls on the use of additives in feedstuffs, and in food, and ensure better labelling. Our aim is to make it easier for new entrants, such as young farmers, to come into the industry and obtain a tenancy. We will do this with the help of a new Rural Land Authority, which will administer rural land already publicly-owned and begin to extend public ownership to TENANTED land.  For the FORESTRY INDUSTRY, we intend to reconstitute the Forestry Commission, as described in Labour's Programme 1982, so that it operates as an expanding public enterprise. The commission would cease to act as a spokesman for the private sector; and it will be expected to extend its activities to include the processing side of the industry. We will also seek to increase tree plantings.  A BETTER DEAL FOR WOMEN  Labour's objective is to achieve equality between women and men. Over half the population are women; yet in our society, paid employment is seen as important while domestic skills - involving caring for children - do not enjoy their proper status. Women should have a genuine choice between staying at home to look after the family or going to work. Men and women should be able to share the rights and responsibilities of paid employment and domestic activities, so that job segregation within and outside the home is broken down.  Tory attacks on women's rights and opportunities have more than doubled the numbers of unemployed women and destroyed services which women in particular depend upon. Labour will do more than reverse these policies. We will:  - Expand current positive action programmes as well as introduce wide-ranging new schemes in order to encourage women to train and apply for new job opportunities, particularly in the area of new technology.  - Provide equal pay for work of equal value by amending the Equal Pay Act; and take action, together with the trade unions, against low pay.  - Strengthen the Sex Discrimination Act to include direct and indirect discrimination on the grounds of family status, and shift the burden of proof from the complainant to the alleged discriminator.  - Strengthen and expand the role of the Equal Opportunities Commission.  - Restore and extend women's employment rights to include part-time and home workers.  - Reverse the Tory attack on employment, social services and maternity rights.  - Improve the level of financial support to families with children and disabled dependants. The household duties test will be abolished. Extra help will be given to one-parent families.  - Establish an integrated system of child care with priority for children in the most deprived areas. Our aim will be to introduce, as soon as possible, a statutory duty on local authorities to provide nursery education for all pre school children whose parents wish it.  - Take steps to end discrimination in education and training, as set out in Labour's Programme 1982.  - Provide the resources to make a major improvement in the personal social services for the care of elderly, sick and disabled people.  - Within the NHS, improve community services, extend preventive measures including screening, and develop child health services.  - Increase the maternity grant to at least &pound;100.  - Provide fair treatment for widows.  - Increase the death grant to at least &pound;200.  - Work to establish equal treatment in tax and social security.  - End VAT on sanitary protection.  - Appoint a cabinet minister to promote equality between the sexes.  - Review the whole question of divorce and maintenance.  - Establish a fairer system of family law, and introduce Family Courts.  - Give more support for victims of rape; and provide an urgent review of police and court procedures in cases of rape and violence against women.  - Improve ante-natal and maternity services, and respect the wishes of women in childbirth.  - Support the provision of family crisis centres and more refuges for battered women.  While continuing to defend and respect the absolute right of individual conscience, we will improve NHS facilities for family planning and abortion, including counselling and day-care; and we will remove barriers to the implementation of the existing right of choice for women in the termination of a pregnancy.  FAIR SHARES  Our plan for expansion must be supported by measures to create a fairer Britain. We shall reform taxation so that the rich pay their full share and the tax burden on the lower paid is reduced. By progressively increasing the real value of the personal allowance, we will help the lower paid and those on average earnings. We intend also to bring down the starting point of the highest rates of tax, and to remove the present ceiling on earnings-related National Insurance contributions.  In Labour's Programme 1982, we explain how we will reduce tax avoidance. This will include action on family trusts and investment income. We also intend to limit the open-ended availability to higher-rate tax payers of various tax reliefs. A determined attack will be mounted on illegal tax evasion.  We shall also reform indirect taxation. We will extend zero-rating under VAT, with different rates for essentials and non-essentials.  Capital taxes will be used to reduce the huge inequalities in inherited wealth. We shall reverse most of the Tories' concessions on capital transfer tax and introduce a new annual tax on net personal wealth, along the lines set out in Labour's Programme 1982. This will ensure that the richest 100,000 of the population make a fair and proper contribution to tax revenue.  HELPING FAMILIES  Labour will give families a better deal. Our first priority will be to help families with children in order to support them in the task of parenthood. The Tories refuse to accept the wide variety in the type and size of families. Their policies restrict choice for members of families - in particular they reduce the freedom of men and women to choose whether to work or to stay at home and look after their families. At the same time, Tory policy has trapped more and more families in poverty through a combination of means-tested benefits and a tax system which bites hardest on the lowest paid.  We aim to recast the tax and benefit system, so as to redistribute resources to families with children. Our priority is child benefit. We will increase it by &pound;2.00 a week, make it index-linked, and subsequently improve it in real terms, as resources allow. In the longer term, we shall aim to raise child benefit to the level of child support given to those on long-term benefits. We shall also restore the rights to weekly payment of child benefit; increase the maternity grant to &pound;100; and give extra help to one-parent families.  We shall continue to help family budgets throughout the parliament:  - By increasing personal tax allowances - thus taking the poorest families out of the tax net;  - By making further increases in child benefit;  - By extending and improving the Invalid Care Allowance for those who care for disabled people.  To help pay for these improvements we shall, over the lifetime of the parliament, phase out the married man's additional tax allowance for those under the age of retirement. Married couples with dependants will clearly benefit considerably from these changes - whilst the overall change for those WITHOUT dependants, given the increases in personal allowance, will be small in any one year. However, we recognise that the loss of the allowance could cause financial difficulty for those couples where one of the spouses is not in work. We shall therefore consider how best to give support to these married couples where there are no dependants. Our aim is to end sex discrimination in taxation. We favour the principle of separate taxation and are examining how best to implement this.  A NEW DEAL FOR PENSIONERS  We believe that elderly people, both today's pensioners as well as those who will benefit in future from Labour's pension scheme, should share as of right in our future prosperity. We shall:  - Uprate the pension in November 1983 by the full amount necessary to protect its real value against the rise in inflation to that date.  - Increase pensions, as soon as practicable, by &pound;1.45 for a single person and &pound;2.25 for a married couple. This is the amount pensioners have lost through the Tories breaking the link between pensions and earnings.  - Link pensions and average earnings, when these are rising faster than prices, and extend this to all benefits.  - Make progress towards our aim of a common pension age of 60.  - Double the Christmas bonus to &pound;20.  - Phase out the TV licence for pensioners, during the lifetime of the Labour government.  - Give women the additional tax allowance for the elderly - the age allowance - at 60 instead of 65.  - Increase the Death Grant to &pound;200 and extend it to cover all deaths.  - Introduce a Pension Schemes Act that will more adequately protect occupational pensions from the effects of inflation than they are at present; protect the position of early leavers; and extend to members of schemes, rights to participation and to greater information.  - Introduce, in areas where more favourable concessionary travel on local transport does not exist, a nationwide, off-peak, half-fares scheme for pensioners.  - Reform the harsh supplementary benefit rules introduced by the Tories.  - Reduce energy costs, for pensioners, both through support for conservation and by introducing new fuel allowances.  HELP FOR THE UNEMPLOYED  Working people are entitled to a decent income when they lose their job through circumstances beyond their control. An improved earnings-related supplement will once again be paid during the first months of unemployment. We shall end the discrimination whereby the unemployed are not entitled to the long-term rate of supplementary benefit after a year. We shall also consider how best to improve unemployment benefit for the longer-term unemployed so that large-scale supplementation is not required.  HELP FOR PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES  The last Labour government established, for the first time, the basis for eliminating poverty among disabled people. We intend to build on this. We will:  - Introduce a &pound;10 a week blindness allowance, as a first step towards the introduction of a new cash benefit for disabled people, which will vary according to the degree of disability.  - Bring up the non-contributory invalidity pension to the level of the flat-rate contributory invalidity benefit, and restore the 5 per cent cut in invalidity benefit.  - Help the many disabled people who are capable of working part-time or for limited periods, but discouraged by present benefit regulations. We shall amend these to take account of their needs.  - Abolish the household duties test for housewives' non-contributory invalidity pension and extend invalid care allowance to all those women presently excluded.  - Continue to pay mobility allowance to existing recipients as they reach the age of 75.  - Ensure the full implementation of the Chronically Sick and Disabled Persons Act.  - For those who require long-term care - elderly, mentally handicapped, mentally ill and disabled people - develop services within both the health service and the local authority services, based on support for them and their families within the community.  - Make proper provision for the 20 per cent of children requiring various forms of special education. We will promote and provide the resources for the integration within mainstream schooling of those children whose needs are best met by ordinary schools.  Labour will also aim to overcome discrimination against the disabled at work. We will reverse the Tory cuts, which have caused unnecessary suffering for people with disabilities. We shall increase the number of disablement resettlement officers; extend capital grants to adapt employer's premises; strengthen existing schemes - especially rehabilitation - to help disabled people back to work; and introduce new legislation, including quotas, to secure employment opportunities and job protection for disabled people.  A FAIRER BENEFIT SYSTEM  The new supplementary benefit scheme introduced by the Tories is harsh and unfair. We shall reform it. The families of those involved in industrial disputes will be entitled to full benefits - less any strike pay actually paid. We shall return to a sliding scale for assessing capital and the surrender value of insurance policies will be excluded. The anomaly which prevents some widows from claiming long-term supplementary benefit will be removed. We shall give extra help to families with children.  We shall improve staffing levels and physical conditions in social security offices so as to provide a more humane and responsive service for claimants. Many people fail to claim benefit to which they are entitled. We shall aim to increase take-up by improvements in publicity and the provision of advice.  All the social security changes made by the Tories, including the new sick pay and housing benefit schemes, will be reviewed. If they do not treat working people and their families fairly, we will replace them.  Forty years have elapsed since the Beveridge Report which led to the setting up of the National Insurance scheme by the post war Labour government. We shall conduct a thorough review of the scheme in the light of today's circumstances.  THE RIGHT TO HEALTH CARE  The creation of the National Health Service is one of the greatest achievements of the Labour Party. It now faces a double threat from the Tories: a lack of resources for decent health care; and the active encouragement of private practice. Labour will act to defend the basic principles of the service. We will ensure that it is free at the point of use and funded out of taxation, and that priority depends on medical need not ability to pay.  To meet rising costs due to improved medical technology and the age composition of the population, and to allow for a general expansion of our under-funded health services, we shall increase health service expenditure by 3 per cent per annum in real terms. We will also seek a fairer distribution of these resources at both regional and district level. Since the election, prescription charges have increased from 20p to &pound;1.40 per item. Labour will phase out health charges. We shall also ensure that NHS staff receive a fair reward for their work and dedication; and we will discuss with the TUC new arrangements for pay determination and the resolution of disputes.  Our overriding aim will be to reduce inequalities in standards of health care for all who need it. We will:  - Give greater emphasis to prevention, both within the health and personal social services. We will come forward with proposals to help prevent accidents and disease, including action on advertising.  - Give priority to improving our primary health care services, especially in the inner cities.  - Continue to improve the ante-natal and maternity services and develop our child health services; and we will respect the wishes of women in child birth.  - Introduce an independent complaints system in both hospital and family practitioner services.  - Recognise the importance of community health councils and ensure that they have the power and facilities to represent fully the consumer point of view.  - Abolish the special charges for overseas visitors, and end passport checks.  - Take a major public stake in the pharmaceutical industry - and ensure that the drugs available are safe, effective and economic.  The present expansion in private medicine is a serious threat to our priorities in health care. We will not allow the development of a two-tier health service, where the rich can jump the queue. We shall remove private practice from the NHS and take into the NHS those parts of the profit-making private sector which can be put to good use. We shall also stop public subsidies to the private sector and prevent it expanding further. We will give proper recognition to those consultants who make a full-time commitment to the NHS; and we will provide incentives to those choosing to work in under-doctored areas and specialities.  While continuing to defend and respect the absolute right of individual conscience, we will improve NHS facilities for family planning and abortion, including counselling and day-care; and we will remove barriers to the implementation of the existing right of choice for women in the termination of a pregnancy.  PERSONAL SOCIAL SERVICES  Personal social services - such as childcare, home helps, meals on wheels and residential and day care for the elderly and handicapped, are a vital part of our welfare state. And it is those who are most vulnerable in our society who depend most upon them.  The Tory cuts in the social services have hit women hardest. They have meant lost jobs for many women and a loss of support for the elderly and disabled, thus forcing women to stay at home as unpaid carers. A major improvement in personal social services will be necessary, not only to raise the standard of living of those who depend upon them, but also to give women an equal right to work. Labour will reverse the Tory cuts, improve and expand services so that they can complement the much better community health services we shall provide. This will involve increasing spending by at least 4 per cent a year in real terms. We will:  - Increase joint finance and extend it to cover other agencies.  - Require social services departments to plan and develop services for children jointly with education and health authorities.  - Strengthen the Chronically Sick and Disabled Persons Act so that it provides a Charter of Rights for disabled people everywhere.  - Require local authorities to develop preventive services for children at risk.  - Give greater attention to the needs of ethnic minorities.  - Encourage the growth of local, independent advice and advocacy services.  EDUCATION FOR THE FUTURE  If individuals are to achieve their full creative potential, and our society is to advance, we must substantially improve educational provision and opportunity. The Tories' cuts have shown that they have no commitment to a free and fair education system. The fact is, however, that economic and social progress will depend on our success in making use of the abilities of the whole of our population.  For the under-fives, our goal is to achieve comprehensive provision, with priorities for children in the most deprived areas. We will unify education and care services for the under-fives, both nationally and locally. Our aim will be to introduce a statutory duty on local authorities to provide nursery education, as soon as possible, for all pre-school children whose parents wish it.  SCHOOLS IN THE COMMUNITY  Primary education is fundamental to all educational and social development, as any parent knows. We will restore funds to local education authorities to reduce class sizes; and improve learning materials and facilities in primary schools so that our children receive the best possible start in their schooling.  Secondary education is a period during which all young people must prepare themselves as the workers and citizens of the future. We shall encourage a higher standard of achievement among all pupils in the variety of academic and other activities which are essential parts of fully comprehensive education. We will:  - Repeal the Education Act 1979 and prohibit all forms of academic selection, such as the eleven plus, as a condition of admission to secondary schools.  - Require local education authorities to maintain a broad, balanced and comprehensive curriculum, providing genuinely equal opportunities for boys and girls, and for the ethnic minorities to meet the needs of our multi-cultural society.  - Establish a common system of assessment for all 16 year olds which will encourage effort and accurately record achievement at school.  Throughout the whole of schooling, we will:  - Determine a supply of appropriately qualified teachers to reduce class sizes. No class size should be over 30. The quality and frequency of teacher in-service training must be improved so that teachers receive no less than one school term of training in every five years of service.  - Discuss with the local authorities ways of developing a reformed system for funding education. Whilst safeguarding local democracy in education, this must secure and maintain improved national standards of provision in essential areas.  - Abolish corporal punishment; and help local authorities and schools to develop other methods, already successfully practised in many schools, for dealing with bad behaviour.  - Positively encourage parental understanding and participation in the education of their children by increasing parental representation on school governing bodies and increasing the links between home and school.  - Re-establish the school meals and milk services, cut back by the Tories. This will help to offset the inequalities, for example in nutrition, highlighted by the Black Report.  Private schools are a major obstacle to a free and fair education system, able to serve the needs of the whole community. We will abolish the Assisted Places Scheme and local authority place buying; and we will phase out, as quickly as possible, boarding allowances paid to government personnel for their children to attend private schools, whilst ensuring secure accommodation for children needing residential education.  We shall also withdraw charitable status from private schools and all their other public subsidies and tax privileges. We will also charge VAT on the fees paid to such schools; phase out fee charging; and integrate private schools within the local authority sector where necessary. Special schools for handicapped pupils will retain all current support and tax advantages.  POST 16 EDUCATION  For 16 and 17 year olds, we will introduce a two years' student-traineeship within a third or 'tertiary', stage of education, as described in the section on young people. A 'tertiary awards council' will be established to develop and validate a proper system of educational assessment for the whole of the age group. Our aim is to replace the rigid 'A' level system with a broader programme of study within the student-traineeship, thus preventing over specialisation and promoting flexibility and breadth in learning.  Our policy for education after eighteen is expansion with change. We will reverse the Tory cuts and restore the right for all qualified young people seeking higher education to secure places. We will also substantially expand opportunities for adults in both further and higher education.  We reject the Tory proposals for student loans; and we will ensure students are given adequate financial support. We will also provide proper financial support for those on non-advanced, part-time advanced, and Open University courses.  ADULT EDUCATION  We are determined to give priority to adults who have been denied educational opportunity on leaving school. We will:  - Give statutory backing to paid educational leave for workers.  - Phase in a new, adult educational entitlement that will provide one year of education, backed by financial support for adults who have never received education after eighteen.  - Require educational institutions to be more flexible in their admissions procedures and methods of study.  - Establish a proper legal basis for adult education; and create a development council to promote adult and continuing education.  - Establish machinery to plan and co ordinate all post 18-education together and ensure that the bodies funding universities, and planning local authority further, higher and continuing education, are more accountable and representative.  A NEW DEAL FOR YOUNG PEOPLE  Labour will end the scourge of youth unemployment and prepare young people to take up the jobs that we will create. We will also encourage all young people in employment to join a trade union. Our radical new scheme for young people will establish a new, two year student-traineeship for all 16 and 17 year olds. It will bring together, for the first time, the first years of apprenticeships, other training schemes for young workers and the young unemployed and courses in full-time education in schools and colleges. We will:  - Give to young people who are at work the right to be released to college or school, on full pay. Employers will be given a statutory duty to provide opportunities for their young employees to receive systematic education and training and to release student-trainees at their request. Premiums will be paid to them to recruit young people and provide them with such opportunities.  - Abolish the so-called Young Workers' Scheme, set up by the Tories to reduce youth wages. Labour rejects completely the Tory argument that young people have priced themselves out of jobs.  - Offer all young people without work a place on new youth training schemes, with proper education and training opportunities - which can best be guaranteed by active monitoring by the trade unions; and give them an allowance of at least &pound;30 per week - the level of which will be agreed annually with the TUC - with trade unions being free to negotiate better terms.  - Provide student-trainees, in full-time education, with an educational maintenance allowance of &pound;25 a week, at 1983 prices, covering 52 weeks in a year.  Labour will establish new rights and provide more resources for youth. We will:  - Expand and improve the youth service so that it meets the social, cultural and recreational needs of young people - especially the unemployed, young women, the ethnic minorities and the young disabled.  - Established a 'youth initiatives fund' to give greater recognition and support to organisations which represent young people's interest.  - Encourage local authorities to support representative local youth councils as one of the means of enabling young people to influence public affairs as young adults.  - Expand funding and staffing for the provision of social studies and education for citizenship in youth clubs and schools with the aim of informing young people of their civil, political and trade union rights and responsibilities as citizens. Accredited trade union representatives should be involved with secondary school students in the context of such education, with full facilities for such representatives at all career days.  HOMES FOR EVERYONE  Britain faces a major housing crisis. The Tories have slashed public spending on housing by half and house building is at its lowest since the 1920's. Houses are falling into disrepair faster than they can be repaired, while homelessness and waiting lists continue to grow. Labour will reverse this decline. Our aim is a decent home for all with real freedom of choice between renting and owning, on terms people can afford.  Labour governments have done more than any others to assist owner occupiers; and we will extend this by giving special assistance to first-time buyers and council tenants.  Labour will immediately increase by half the total housing investment programmes for local authorities. This will be a first step in increasing resources for council housing repairs and improvements and for new public sector house building. We will also give a new priority to getting empty council owned housing back into use. We will overhaul and extend the renovation grant and area improvement programme to tackle properly the decay of our older houses. New and better housing and environmental standards will be developed and greater provision will be made for hitherto neglected groups, such as single people.  COUNCIL HOUSING  The Tories have forced council rents to more than double. The number of council homes for rent is falling because of the rundown of new building and enforced sales. Thousands have to cope with leaking roofs and damp, inadequate heating, broken down lifts, noise, lack of security, increasing disrepair and neglect.  Labour will give council tenants a new deal. In addition to a freeze on rents for a full year, and the restoration of subsidies, Labour will:  - fund a national action programme to repair and improve or replace run-down estates, especially the system-built developments in which so many defects have been revealed.  - Strengthen tenants' rights on security, repairs and improvements, access to files, exchanges, transfers, moves between local authority areas, and rehousing rights on breakdown of relationship;  - Encourage more responsive and decentralised housing management and maintenance, and promote tenant participation and democracy, including housing co-operatives;  - End all residential and other qualifications, which unfairly exclude people from council housing in the area where they live, extend the 'priority' groups under the Housing (Homeless Persons) Act and strengthen the rights of homeless people;  - End enforced council house sales, empower public landlords to repurchase homes sold under the Tories on first resale and provide that future voluntary agreed sales will be at market value.  HOME OWNERSHIP  Labour believes in real home ownership at prices people can afford. Under the Tories the mortgage rate reached its highest ever level at 15 per cent and is still at 10 per cent. They have done little to help low income groups become owners.  We support financial assistance for owner-occupation and will maintain mortgage tax relief for existing house purchasers at the current rate. The unfairness of mortgage tax relief above the basic rate, which gives most benefit to the highest incomes, will be phased out. We will also examine the possibility of a new and substantial form of financial help for first time buyers, with special consideration for council and new town tenants, aimed at easing the heavy initial burdens of house purchase.  Labour will act to help home-owners. We will:  - Simplify and reduce the cost of house purchase, ending the solicitors' conveyancing monopoly, and require full disclosure of mortgage lending terms and practices;  - Make it easier for lower income groups to borrow funds on secure terms by greatly expanding council mortgage lending and providing the funds needed. This will be financed primarily by on-lending from the building societies, at least 10 per cent of whose funds should be made available in this way;  - Allow and encourage councils to provide a unified house-purchase service, including estate agency, surveying, conveyancing and mortgage lending;  - End the leasehold system for houses, strengthen the rights of leaseholders of flats and increase protection to mobile home residents.  PRIVATELY RENTED HOUSING  The worst housing conditions are in privately rented housing. The Tories have loosened the controls on rents and security of tenure and pushed up rents. If they get the chance, they would abolish ALL controls.  Labour will ensure that tenants are fully protected. We will:  - Actively encourage the transfer of all property owned by absentee private landlords to the public or owner-occupied sectors, with local authorities setting the pace. This will not apply to owner-occupiers letting all or part of their home.  - Repeal the Tories' shorthold scheme and close other loopholes in security of tenure; and strengthen tenants' rights on deposits and harassment.  - Strengthen councils' powers to enforce repairs and improvements and the standards of management, particularly in multi-occupied properties; and launch a programme of action against property held empty without justification.  - Bring forward measures to strengthen tied tenants' rights and improve their access to secure housing when they leave their job.  - Bring service charges for private tenants and leaseholders within the fair rents scheme.  HELP FOR ALL TENANTS  Tenants in both the public and private sectors are plagued with difficulties caused by all-too frequent failure of landlords to carry out repairs satisfactorily and speedily. Tenants recognise that major structural repairs, for example to blocks of flats or maisonettes, can only be dealt with by large-scale improvement projects. But they rightly see no reason why routine repairs should be neglected. Labour will launch a new initiative aimed at tackling this troublesome problem.  We will introduce a right to repair for all tenants - council, new town, housing associations and private landlord. This will give tenants the right to force landlords, including councils, to get routine repairs done, with landlords footing the cost. Where there are council direct labour organisations, these will be responsible for doing this work. Major structural work will not be included, but the Labour government will assist councils to carry out such work through much larger capital investment allocations and reinstatement of an adequate housing subsidy system.  We also intend to reform the system of housing benefits for low income groups. A new Housing Tribunal will be established to replace the present confusing jumble of courts, tribunals and committees, as an accessible means of resolving landlord-tenant disputes.  CONSTRUCTION  The Tory recession has seriously damaged the construction industry. Company after company has gone bankrupt. Nearly 400,000 construction workers are on the dole. Labour's plan for expansion will help the industry back to its feet. But we will also introduce changes to the industry, as described in Labour's Programme, 1982 - not least to help stabilise the industry's workload. We will also provide greater job security for employees; and we will work out, with the agreement of the trade unions, a system of decasualisation.  We also believe that a major new role should be played in the industry by public and co-operative enterprise - to provide a new source of enterprise, initiative and innovation. We will establish a new, publicly-owned company, as a major pace-making public enterprise, for large and medium-sized construction projects. In addition, to help protect the public interest, we will extend public ownership into the building materials industry, in which a small number of large companies now enjoy near monopoly conditions.  We will also give generous and active support to the development of workers' co operatives, especially at the jobbing' end of the industry. We will reverse Tory policies towards local authority direct labour organisations. We will give them more scope by allowing them to compete for other work in their locality, while ensuring that they are efficiently run as municipal enterprises. We will oppose the contracting out of government services to privately-owned companies.  PLANNING FOR PEOPLE  The way we plan the use of our land affects every one of us. It determines where we build our housing, the kind of shopping centres which are available, and where new jobs and factories are sited. We are determined to strengthen local planning and ensure greater participation by ordinary people over the decisions which affect their lives.  The Tories have always put the interests of property developers before the needs of local people. Labour will change this. We will ensure that local authorities are able to decide on the positive use of land in their areas instead of having to respond to the initiatives of developers. And we shall take explicit powers to link land-use planning firmly with the economic and social planning of local authorities.  A key issue in planning at local level is the ownership and use of land. We are determined to stop land speculation and make sensible and comprehensive planning possible. We will establish new land authorities, similar to the successful Land Authority of Wales, with the powers and funds needed to acquire development land - at its CURRENT USE VALUE - so that local plans can be fulfilled. Our proposals do NOT APPLY to owner-occupiers, whose homes and gardens will be safeguarded.  We intend also to widen democratic participation in the planning system by:  - Codifying and extending public rights of consultation, and of appeal against planning decisions;  - Improving access to public planning inquiries and broadening their terms of reference;  - Ensuring that, before the inquiry stage of certain major development proposals, the environmental effects are subject to detailed analysis and the report is published;  - Creating a new fund to help objectors at major public inquiries, with an independent board to decide who should be helped and by how much.  THE INNER CITIES  The decay, squalor and level of unemployment in our inner cities are a national disgrace. Labour is determined to reverse their decline. We will provide more resources, more investment and more jobs. We will act to ensure, through the policies set out in this campaign document, that people living in the inner cities have access to decent homes, health and education - and that there is proper accountability for the police.  In addition to providing a major increase of funds for the Urban Programme, we will:  - Use agreed development plans, negotiated at national level with major firms - public and private - to locate investment and jobs in the inner cities.  - Use regional development agencies to prepare sites, encourage municipal and co-operative enterprise, and help improve transport and other facilities.  - Get local authorities to prepare local economic and social plans. We will also support the development of well-financed local enterprise boards in areas which need them - and enable local authorities to conclude agreed development plans with small and medium-sized local firms.  THE ENVIRONMENT  Labour believes that the countryside should be preserved and enhanced as a source of recreation for town and country dwellers alike and as a habitat for wild creatures and plants. Everyone has a right to a decent living and working environment.  We intend to monitor closely - and publicly - the nation's progress in improving the environment. We shall therefore present to parliament each year a major report on the 'State of the Environment'. We will also safeguard our heritage by:  - Supporting rights of access to common land. We will stop landed interests from preventing access for anglers;  - Strengthening the planning laws to ensure that the countryside is protected from damaging development;  - Strengthening the legislation which protects endangered species;  - Providing increased resources so that the Nature Conservancy Council and Countryside Commission can function effectively;  - Enacting a new Wildlife and Countryside Act and providing proper protection for sites of special scientific interests.  We will also act to curb pollution. We will:  - Proceed with the implementation of the 1974 Control of Pollution Act.  - Undertake a comprehensive review of the effectiveness of the present machinery and powers on pollution control.  - Eliminate lead in petrol by setting a date after which all new cars will be required to use only lead-free petrol. The interests of motorists will be safeguarded.  - Restore those environmental agencies abolished by the Tories with a responsibility for monitoring air and noise pollution.  - Develop a programme for eliminating toxic substances from our living and working environments.  We will reform the water industry by repealing the Tories' Water Act and restoring democratic accountability in the industry. We will re-establish a national authority charged with responsibility for the strategic planning and use of all water resources. The canal system will be brought under a new national authority, so that it can be developed and maintained as an essential water resource. We will also consider how best to provide help, for those on low incomes, with paying their water rates.  RURAL AREAS  Tory policies have seriously harmed the rural areas. Bus services have disappeared. Rail links are under threat. Jobs have been axed. Houses are not being built. Village halls and sub-post offices have been closed. Labour will act to improve the quality of life in the rural areas; and we have outlined our plans in Labour's Programme 1982 and in our statement Out of Town, Out of Mind. We will give greater priority to rural problems. And ministers will be expected to bring about greater co-ordination in promoting our policies. We will:  - Ensure that the Development Commission, and its counterparts in Scotland and Wales, become actively involved in implementing our policies for rural regeneration.  - Take measures to increase employment by encouraging the expansion of light industry and tourism in the rural areas, while safeguarding the rural nature of the countryside.  - Improve the rural public transport network by a major injection of public funds and a better use of existing resources.  - Wherever possible retain village schools and generally improve educational provision for all age groups; and introduce mobile health clinics and mobile 'all purpose' community services offices.  - Take extensive measures to expand the provision of all types of housing in the rural areas, which will also help to deal with the 'Second Home' problem.  TRANSPORT  Four years of Tory government has meant serious damage to Britain's transport system. Profitable elements have been sold off. Important but unprofitable sections left in public hands are being starved of investment. The quality of public transport services has fallen disastrously.  Another Tory government would mean even poorer services, higher fares and lower safety standards. Labour repudiates this whole approach. We believe that the improvement of public transport must be a major social priority, which can only be achieved by a sensibly integrated transport system. We describe our proposals in Labour's Programme 1982.  We will maintain and improve the rail network, invest in the electrification of the main lines and replace worn-out railway stock. We will encourage the use of the railways for freight traffic by extending grants for rail freight facilities and encouraging the development of trans-shipment depots.  Heavy lorries will be made to bear their full share of road costs, including environment costs. We will cut to a minimum noise and pollution from goods vehicles and introduce national routeings and restrictions to take lorries away from people. Vehicle Excise Duty for private cars will be abolished and the revenue secured by a higher tax on petrol.  Labour believes that, together with a properly enforced licensing system, a publicly-owned share of the road haulage industry is essential. It would clearly be sensible for the National Freight Company to form part of this sector; and we are examining how best to bring this about.  We will ensure that local authorities are able to give proper support to public transport. In areas where more favourable concessionary travel on local transport does not exist, we shall bring in a nationwide, off-peak half-fares scheme for pensioners. A proper licensing system, to safeguard the network of bus services, will be reintroduced. We shall also ensure that a basic minimum level of service is provided throughout the country.  In addition, we will:  - Encourage the development of effective traffic management schemes to alleviate the problems of traffic congestion.  - Improve facilities and safety standards for cyclists and increase financial incentives to local authorities to assist these improvements.  - Give a high priority to building by passes.  - Establish a national shipping organisation able to acquire and operate shipping services; and protect our shipping and jobs from unfair foreign competition.  - Invest in inland waterways, and encourage the greater use of them - and of coastal shipping - in the interests of taking freight off our roads.  - Establish a new National Ports Authority to take ports into public ownership and to develop a new overall strategy for these.  - Create a National Transport Authority to develop transport policy and good practice, secure integration and facilitate comprehensive planning.  LAW, ORDER AND JUSTICE  Labour's aim is to ensure that all sections of the community are safe on the street and at home, free from the fear that crime generates. We believe that the police should have the support of the community, have their rights safeguarded, and be fairly paid. But we also believe that it is as much in the interests of the police, as of their local communities, that they are properly accountable and fully subject to the law. We will ensure that, throughout the country, the police are encouraged to return to the beat and therefore closer to the communities they serve. That is the best way of preventing and detecting crime.  We intend to protect the rights of individual suspects, while providing the police with sufficient powers to do their job effectively whilst not infringing the civil rights of individual suspects. We aim to create elected police authorities in all parts of the country, including London, with statutory responsibility for the determination of police policy within their areas. We will also:  - Launch a major initiative to help victims, including extending and simplifying the present Criminal Injuries Compensation Scheme.  - Give priority to crime prevention as part of our action programme for run down estates.  - Bring about better co-ordination in the technical, support and information services of the police.  - Replace the present police complaints procedure with an independent system accountable to local communities, with minority police representation.  - Create community police councils to provide an opportunity for open discussion between police and the community as to the quality and manner of police provision.  - Introduce strict limits on searches of people in the street, searches of premises, the use of the power of arrest, and on the time a prisoner can be held in custody before being charged.  - Protect the rights of those in police custody, by giving revised Judges Rules, which safeguard those under arrest or interrogation, the force of law and, in England and Wales, take the role of prosecutor away from the police by implementing a public prosecutor system, on the Procurator Fiscal model.  - Repeal the Police and Criminal Evidence Bill, because it infringes the rights and freedoms of individuals.  - Disband the London Special Patrol Groups and local SPGs, which have increasingly been deployed in aggressive public order roles.  ACCESS TO LEGAL SERVICES  We will not allow people's legal rights to go by default. Accessible level services are essential to protect human rights. As described in Labour's Programme 1982, we will increase central government spending to set up new law centres and help existing ones, and to improve the legal aid scheme by widening its provisions. We will also introduce a system of appeals against the refusal of legal aid in criminal cases.  We will speed the extension of duty solicitor schemes to all magistrate courts and police stations in England and Wales. We will also introduce measures to help citizens to secure their legal rights in the areas of tribunal and welfare rights law.  We will co-ordinate the responsibility for advice and legal services so that ministerial responsibility is clearer and more direct. We will also establish a new Legal Services Commission to be responsible for the provision and financing of public legal services. Our aim is to ensure that the expertise and training of the legal profession should be geared far more than at present to those legal problems affecting ordinary people.  THE PENAL SYSTEM  No one concerned for human dignity and civil rights can find our prison system acceptable. We are determined to improve conditions. We do not accept that wives and children should be punished together with the prisoners. We will:  - Reduce the prison population by cutting many maximum sentence lengths for non-violent offenders. We will stop putting petty offenders into prison. We will expand non-custodial alternatives, and examine new penalties involving reparation and restitution to the victim. We will also introduce a maximum period of custody for those on remand, along the lines of the provisions in Scotland.  - Treat prisoners as human beings by providing reasonable conditions in our prisons. We will incorporate, in new, legally enforceable prison rules, minimum standards on such matters as cell space. And we will reduce unnecessary restrictions - for example on prisoners' correspondence.  - Refurbish urban prisons.  - Hand over all specialist services in prisons, such as medical care, to the normal community agencies.  - Establish a genuinely independent complaints and disciplinary procedure to replace the current board of visitors system; and provide better aftercare for those leaving prison, to help them resettle in the community.  - Improve the training, working conditions and job opportunities of prison officers.  - Examine the additional problems faced by women prisoners, especially those with young children.  EQUAL RIGHTS  The next Labour government will lead a political offensive against racial disadvantage, discrimination and harassment; and we have set out our proposals in Labour's Programme 1982. To encourage equality and reduce discrimination, we will greatly expand funding to ethnic minority projects. We will also encourage local authorities, in selecting projects under the Urban Programme, to provide for greater ethnic minority participation. We will also:  - Stimulate a wide range of positive action programmes to ensure that ethnic minorities receive a fair deal - in employment, education, housing and social services: and encourage the keeping of ethnic records, in order to assess the needs of ethnic minorities and take steps to meet them.  - Launch a major public education initiative aimed at eliminating prejudice.  - Strengthen the existing Race Relations Act - in particular, to enable us to deal more effectively with racialist literature, speeches and marches; and to remove the exception for seamen recruited abroad.  - Appoint a senior minister to lead the offensive against racial inequality.  We are concerned that homosexuals are unfairly treated. We will take steps to ensure that they are not unfairly discriminated against - especially in employment and in the definition of privacy contained in the 1967 Act - along the lines set out in Labour's Programme, 1982.  NATIONALITY AND IMMIGRATION  Through their immigration and nationality laws, the Tories have divided families and caused immense suffering in the immigrant communities. We accept the need for immigration controls. But we will repeal the 1971 Immigration Act and the 1981 British Nationality Act and replace them with a citizenship law that does not discriminate against either women or black and Asian Britons.  Under our NATIONALITY ACT, we will restore rights removed by the Tories, such as the right to automatic citizenship if born in Britain. The Act will enable other Commonwealth and foreign nationals to acquire citizenship if they qualify by objective tests, and provide a right of appeal against the refusal of an application for citizenship. We will also ensure that the cost of acquiring citizenship will no longer be an obstacle to those who wish to apply.  Under our new IMMIGRATION ACT we will liberalise the age limit criteria for children and the criteria for elderly parents and other relatives. We will simplify the procedures and commit the resources necessary for all applications to be processed promptly; and allow medical examinations, including x-rays, only for medical, not administrative purposes. The race and sex discrimination in the husbands and fiances' rules will be ended: we will restore the entitlement to admission to join a woman settled here irrespective of her citizenship, birthplace or ancestry. We will also ensure that immigration officials fully respect the human rights of those seeking entry. We will also:  - Consult Commonwealth governments so as to resolve the question of the other British nationals from independent countries who possess no other citizenship.  - Provide a right of appeal for those who the Home Secretary proposes to deport or exclude on security grounds.  - Establish a more independent and balanced panel of adjudicators for immigration appeals.  A WIDER DEMOCRACY  Labour will take action to enhance democratic rights and ensure greater openness and accountability in the institutions of government. We have set out our policies in Labour's Programme, 1982. We shall:  - Introduce a Freedom of Information Bill, providing for a genuine system of open government and placing the onus on the authorities to justify withholding information.  - Bring in data protection legislation to prevent the abuse of confidential information held on personal files; and, subject to certain exceptions, allow individuals access to their personal records.  - Reform the administration of government and the civil service machine so that it meets modern needs and is properly accountable to elected representatives. We recognise the damage done to the morale and efficiency of the civil service by this government. We will work to repair this damage, together with the unions, and to give proper recognition to the importance of the work of the service.  - Take action to abolish the undemocratic House of Lords as quickly as possible and, as an interim measure, introduce a Bill in the first session of parliament to remove its legislative powers - with the exception of those which relate to the life of a parliament.  - Make improvements in the legislative process and procedures in the House of Commons.  - Reform the procedures for appointments to public bodies to ensure they are more open and genuinely representative of the community.  - Overhaul the outdated honours system.  - Give a new priority to making our public services more responsive to the needs and wishes of those who use them. Wherever possible we will decentralise services to make them as close as possible to those who use them. We will also provide more effective procedures for complaints - with clear rights for users - and ensure better training and status for those in contact with the public.  Labour believes that state aid for political parties is now essential for the working of our parliamentary democracy. We will introduce such aid, along the lines set out in the Houghton Report, with the funds available adjusted to today's prices and index linked.  THE SECURITY SERVICES  There is now widespread concern about our security services. We intend that they should become properly accountable institutions - and that the civil rights of individuals are fully protected. We outline in Labour's Programme, 1982 our proposals for a new Security Act, to define the powers and responsibilities of the services, including those concerned with the interception of communications. We will also extend parliamentary accountability - including over the accounts of the services - which will be assisted by a new select committee; prohibit, under the Security Act, unauthorised surveillance; and abolish 'D' notices.  LOCAL DEMOCRACY  Labour is determined to strengthen local democracy. We will shift radically the balance between central and local government and give local communities much more say about how their services are run.  First, we will give local authorities freedom to implement comprehensive local plans, covering economic, social and environmental policies. We explain elsewhere in this document, and more fully in Labour's Programme, 1982, our proposals to assist local authorities to create jobs, to establish local enterprise boards and engage in local economic planning. We will reverse Tory policies on the privatisation of local authority services.  Second, we will expand the scope for local democracy. Instead of local councillors never being completely sure what is permitted and what is ultra vires, we shall give a power of general competence to all local authorities to carry out whatever activities are not expressly forbidden by statute. We shall also seek to define the relationship between central and local government - as part of our consideration of the universal application of realistic minimum standards - so that basic provision of key services is available in all parts of the country. We will also:  Take action to encourage councils to make their services more responsive to the needs and wishes of their clients and of the local community.  Extend workers' rights and industrial democracy in local government, by enabling non-voting employee representatives to be co-opted on to committees, and encouraging the introduction of formal procedures for participation in decisions on the implementation of policy. We will also allow all but the most senior officers the right to become elected or co-opted members of the authority which employs them.  Pay proper allowances, and provide adequate administrative support, to local councillors.  We are examining how best to reform local government. We believe that services such as health, water and sewerage should become answerable to a much greater extent to elected members; and we aim to end, if we can, the present confusing division of services between two tiers of authority. Unitary district authorities, in England and Wales, could be responsible for all of the functions in this area that they could sensibly undertake. We will also ensure that the City of London is absorbed into a reformed democratic system of local government. For Scotland, any reform of local government will be a matter for our proposed Scottish Assembly.  LOCAL GOVERNMENT FINANCE  Labour will reverse the Tory government's attacks on local authority services. We shall provide finance, through the rate support grant, to allow local authority expenditure to grow in line with our plans for economic expansion; and the hard-pressed urban areas will benefit especially from an increased share of the resources available.  Labour believes in active local democracy. We will therefore repeal the Tory legislation which allows the government to impose ceilings on local authority spending, and to impose penalties on local authorities whose spending exceeds those ceilings. We shall repeal the ban on supplementary rates. We will restore the right of local authorities to spend additional amounts from revenue on capital expenditure in excess of loan sanction limits. The rate support grant system will be recast to give fairer treatment to areas in greatest need and the maximum freedom of action for local authorities to control their own budgets.  Labour will also enact legislation to abolish the penalty of personal surcharge on individual councillors. Instead councillors, like others in the community, will be liable at law for any unlawful or illegal acts. Public audit will be confined to that purpose and auditors will not be permitted to involve themselves in judgements on politics or policies.  DEVOLUTION TO SCOTLAND  Labour is determined to decentralise power in decision-making. In Scotland, the people have shown their support for devolution in a referendum and at successive general elections; and we have set out our proposals for devolution in a major statement, Scotland and Devolution. Labour will:  - Establish a directly elected Scottish Assembly, with an executive drawn from members of the assembly.  - Provide the Assembly with legislative and executive powers over a wide range of domestic policy, including matters such as health, education and social welfare.  - Ensure a major role for the Assembly in assisting in the regeneration of Scottish industry - including the preparation and implementation of a Plan for Scotland - within the context of our overall national plan.  - As well as receiving grants from central government, the Scottish Assembly will have tax-raising powers, thus ensuring that the level of services provided can be determined in Scotland.  NORTHERN IRELAND  Labour believes that Ireland should, by peaceful means and on the basis of consent, be united, and recognises that this will be achieved with the introduction of socialist policies. We respect and support, however, the right of the Northern Ireland people to remain within the UK, although this does NOT mean that Unionist leaders can have a veto on political development; and we accept that, to achieve agreement and consent between the two parts of Ireland, we must create greater unity within the Northern Ireland community.  In our 1981 conference statement and in Labour's Programme 1982, we set out in full Labour's policy on Northern Ireland. We will aim to establish an agreed, devolved administration. In the meantime, we will continue with direct rule. We will also initiate early discussions between the British government, the Irish government, the Irish Labour Party, and the trade unions on both sides of the border, and political representatives of the people of Northern Ireland, on how best to proceed with our policy of unification by consent.  Tory policies have been a disaster for the Northern Ireland economy. Unemployment has soared. The economy is in ruins. Housing and the social services are in desperate straits. Labour will give new hope to Northern Ireland. We will create jobs and provide investment. We will use all of the economic planning powers and institutions set out in this document - together with a massive injection of public resources - to rebuild the economy.  We will also act on security and civil rights, along the lines set out in our 1981 statement. We will repeal the Prevention of Terrorism Act and the Payment of Debt Act and reform the system of Diplock courts. We will provide equal rights for women, including rights to abortion, and make progress towards an integrated comprehensive system of education.  LEISURE FOR LIVING  Labour believes that a comprehensive approach is needed, at national and local levels, to provide services and facilities for leisure.  THE ARTS  A crucial part will be played in this by the arts. Labour's aim is to make the arts, in their broadest sense, an accepted part of everyday life for the whole population. We will place special emphasis on their availability to the young, the handicapped and the retired. Substantial extra funds will be provided, with priority being given to the regions and to access for those on low incomes. Local authorities will have a statutory duty to provide adequate arts and entertainments facilities; and the arts will be zero-rated in respect of VAT.  We will retain a Minister of the Arts, whose first task will be to undertake a major survey on the disparities in provision between regions and to produce proposals for action. The public bodies which support the arts will also be made more open and accountable, and include more representation from workers in the arts, local authorities and consumers. The Craft Council will be strengthened, and regional museums and galleries supported through a Museums and Galleries Council.  For the film industry, we will establish a British Film Authority, responsible for the National Film Finance Corporation. This will ensure that revenue from a levy on ticket sales goes to British film-makers who produce British films. We will also ensure that the profits from British film-making and distribution are channelled back into British films - and that the present two-company monopoly of film distribution in Britain is ended. The new British Film Authority will be responsible for extending public ownership into film distribution.  SPORT AND RECREATION  Labour will accept responsibility for the provision of a broadly-based leisure service. We will:  - Encourage greater participation in sport and recreation.  - Give incentives to voluntary bodies to involve themselves more widely in the provision of sporting and community facilities.  - Encourage local authorities and other owners of facilities to make them much more available to public use.  - Set up an immediate enquiry into the financial basis of sport and recreation.  - Review the provision of national sporting facilities, so as to secure a fairer geographical distribution.  - Ensure that the sporting talent of the nation receives sufficient support to enable them to bring sporting success to Britain.  We will also provide for the wider use of the countryside for recreational purposes, such as angling and other water-based sports. Angling will be given additional support, by ensuring wider access to rivers and lakes, financial assistance to provide a wider ownership of fishing waters, improvements in respect of conservation, and action to prevent pollution.  THE MEDIA  Our aims in the media are to safeguard freedom of expression, encourage diversity and establish greater accountability. For all the media, we will introduce a statutory right of reply to ensure that individuals can set the record straight. We will introduce stronger measures to prevent any further concentration in the media.  FOR THE PRESS, we will encourage diversity by:  - Setting up a launch fund to assist new publications.  - Ensuring that all major wholesalers accept any lawful publication, and arrange for its proper supply and display, subject to a handling charge.  - Preventing acquisition of further newspapers by large press chains.  - Protecting freedom of expression by prohibiting joint control of the press, commercial radio and television.  - Breaking up major concentrations of press ownership, by setting an upper limit for the number of major publications in the hands of a single proprietor or press group.  - Replacing the Press Council with a stronger, more representative body.  IN BROADCASTING, we Will aim to make both broadcasting itself, and the organisations responsible, more accountable and representative - and to provide greater public access. Our aim is to promote a more wide-ranging and genuine pluralism in the media, and we set out our prop6sals in Labour's Programme 1982. We will also seek to introduce a genuinely independent adjudication of grievances and complaints. The licence fee will be phased out for pensioners, during the lifetime of the Labour government.  The high standards of British public service broadcasting are threatened by Tory plans to introduce cable TV on free-market principles. We will regulate satellite and cable provision and foster the same principles of diversity and pluralism as conventional broadcasting authorities. To avoid wasteful duplication, we will entrust the provision of the national cable system to British Telecom.  ANIMAL PROTECTION  The Labour Party was the first major political party to publish a policy statement, in 1978, on animal protection - Living Without Cruelty; and these policies are reaffirmed in Labour's Programme 1982. We believe that all animals - whether in the wild, domesticated or farmed - should be properly treated.  To achieve our aims we will transform the Farm Animal Welfare Council into a Standing Royal Commission on Animal Protection. We will also urgently review the 1876 Cruelty to Animals Act. A high priority will be given to research into alternatives to using live animals in experiments, and to restrictions on the use of live animals in experiments - with proper control and supervision in order to avoid pain.  Hare coursing, fox hunting and all forms of hunting with dogs will be made illegal. This will not, however, affect shooting and fishing. The use of snares will also be made illegal.  We will lay down clear conditions on freedom of movement for livestock; and we will ensure that our legislation meets, at least, the requirements of the European Convention for the Protection of Animals kept for Farming Purposes. We will also ban, over a phased period, all extreme livestock systems and introduce legislation to ensure that animals are slaughtered as near as possible to the point of production. We will ban the export of live food animals.  Animals kept in zoos, circuses and safari parks will be included in our animals protection legislation. Health and safety at work legislation will be reviewed in order to better protect people employed on such premises.  BRITAIN AND THE COMMON MARKET  Geography and history determine that Britain is part of Europe, and Labour wants to see Europe safe and prosperous. But the European Economic Community, which does not even include the whole of Western Europe, was never devised to suit us, and our experience as a member of it has made it more difficult for us to deal with our economic and industrial problems. It has sometimes weakened our ability to achieve the objectives of Labour's international policy.  The next Labour government, committed to radical, socialist policies for reviving the British economy, is bound to find continued membership a most serious obstacle to the fulfilment of those policies. In particular the rules of the Treaty of Rome are bound to conflict with our strategy for economic growth and full employment, our proposals on industrial policy and for increasing trade, and our need to restore exchange controls and to regulate direct overseas investment. Moreover, by preventing us from buying food from the best sources of world supply, they would run counter to our plans to control prices and inflation.  For all these reasons, British withdrawal from the Community is the right policy for Britain - to be completed well within the lifetime of the parliament. That is our commitment. But we are also committed to bring about withdrawal in an amicable and orderly way, so that we do not prejudice employment or the prospect of increased political and economic co-operation with the WHOLE of Europe.  We emphasise that our decision to bring about withdrawal in no sense represents any weakening of our commitment to internationalism and international co operation. We are not 'withdrawing from Europe'. We are seeking to extricate ourselves from the Treaty of Rome and other Community treaties which place political burdens on Britain. Indeed, we believe our withdrawal will allow us to pursue a more dynamic and positive international policy - one which recognises the true political and geographical spread of international problems and interests. We will also seek agreement with other European governments - both in the EEC and outside - on a common strategy for economic expansion.  THE PROCESS OF WITHDRAWAL  On taking office we will open preliminary negotiations with the other EEC member states to establish a timetable for withdrawal; and we will publish the results of these negotiations in a White Paper. In addition, as soon as possible after the House assembles, we will introduce a Repeal Bill: first, in order to amend the 1972 European Communities Act, ending the powers of the Community in the UK; and second, to provide the necessary powers to repeal the 1972 Act, when the negotiations on withdrawal are completed.  Following the publication of the White Paper, we will begin the main negotiations on withdrawal. Later, when appropriate and in the same parliament, we will use our powers to repeal the 1972 Act and abrogate the Treaty of Accession - thus breaking all of our formal links with the Community. Britain will at this point withdraw from the Council of Ministers and from the European Parliament.  There will need to be a period of transition, to ensure a minimum of disruption - and to phase in any new agreements we might make with the Community. This will enable us to make all the necessary changes in our domestic legislation. Until these changes in UK law have taken place, the status quo as regards particular items of EEC legislation will remain. And this period will, of course, extend beyond the date when we cease, formally, to be members.  THE INTERNATIONAL DIMENSION  The Labour Party is working to create a democratic socialist society in Britain, but we realise to achieve this we must enjoy the fullest international co-operation. There is a real interdependence between nations, and, if Britain under Labour is not to stand on the sidelines, we must co-operate to survive. Our foreign policy is a logical extension of our work at home.  A deep crisis now afflicts the world economy. In the developed world, recession has meant lengthening dole queues and a falling standard of life; for the peoples of the Third World, recession has added to an already intolerable burden of poverty. Unlike the Tories, Labour believes that there is a way out of the crisis, and that we need not accept an international status quo so manifestly riddled with injustice, inefficiency and waste. Labour will pursue and win international support for policies designed to stimulate trade, investment, and growth; and we shall work inside the appropriate institutions to end the financial chaos which now threatens the stability of so many countries. There can be no sure prospect of peace in a world wracked by an enduring economic crisis. Labour's policies will help bring that crisis to an end.  Labour recognises the urgent need to restore détente and dialogue between the states and the peoples of the world. We will actively pursue dialogue with the Soviet Union and China, and will urge the American government to do so. We will work consistently for peace and disarmament, and devote all our efforts to pulling the world back from the nuclear abyss. Labour will dedicate some of the resources currently wasted on armaments to projects designed to promote both security and human development.  An essential difference between the Labour and the Tory approach is that we have a foreign policy that will help liberate the peoples of the world from oppression, want and fear. We seek to find ways in which social and political progress can be achieved and to identify the role that Britain can play in this process.  Our objectives cannot be pursued in isolation; we will work with the international agencies, friendly governments, and with socialist parties and genuine liberation movements in order to convert these objectives into concrete achievements.  DISARMAMENT - THE INTERNATIONAL CONTEXT  The pursuit of peace, development and disarmament is central to our policy. We wish to strengthen the process of détente, which means the easing of political as well as military tension between East and West. A third world war would destroy civilisation, yet the danger of a nuclear holocaust grows alarmingly.  Labour is determined that Britain should play its full part in the struggle for peace. Now in 1983, in what is a critical year for peace, we can begin to influence events by the way we present the imperative case for disarmament. In government we can carry that influence much further, by example and by common action with others. We must use unilateral steps taken by Britain to secure multilateral solutions on the international level. Unilateralism and multilateralism must go hand ill hand if either is to succeed. It is for this reason that we are against moves that would disrupt our existing alliances, but are resolved on measures to enable Britain to pursue a non-nuclear defence policy.  To achieve our paramount aim - stopping the nuclear arms race itself, and the other arms races pursued beneath its shadow - we need stronger international institutions. First and foremost is a United Nations organisation with real and growing authority. Labour is determined to sustain and fortify the United Nations. All our recent experience re-emphasises how necessary it is to have an international Charter against aggression. It is a tragedy that the 1982 UN Special Session on Disarmament was allowed to disband in failure and disappointment. We shall work to recall a new session on a more ambitious and hopeful basis. We will support the commitments of the UN Special Sessions on Disarmament and the UN Committee on Disarmament.  We shall seek to restore the Final Document on Disarmament, approved by the 1978 United Nations Special Session, as the long-term objective. But, of course, as the international tension sharpens, we must pursue other more immediate aims. Labour has always opposed Soviet deployment of SS20s. We want to see the Geneva talks on intermediate weapons succeed. Labour was arguing that they should begin long before President Reagan and Mrs. Thatcher came round to the idea. It is imperative that the SALT II agreement is ratified. We shall work for this. We strongly support the reduction of strategic weapons in the START talks. We will propose urgent action to make the Non-Proliferation Treaty effective and to keep it effective. The uncontrolled proliferation of nuclear weapons would enormously increase the danger to us all.  Following the steps taken by the last Labour government in such fields as non proliferation and the Mutual and Balanced Force Reduction talks, Britain must again take a lead in disarmament negotiations.  DEFENCE POLICY  The overriding task for Britain, as for the rest of the world, is to draw back from the nuclear abyss. Britain must act on her own account as well as seeking agreement with other countries on nuclear disarmament.  One immediate step our government must take is to insist on implementing the recent United Nations call for a freeze on the production, deployment and testing of nuclear weapons, and for a comprehensive test ban. That the Tory government should have voted against these propositions in the United Nations is deplorable, and betrays our country's capacity to play a leading role as an advocate of world disarmament. Labour's proposals will help to restore that opportunity.  Labour believes in effective defence through collective security but rejects the present emphasis on nuclear weapons. Britain and her allies should have sufficient military strength to discourage external aggression and to defend themselves should they be attacked. Labour's commitment is to establish a non-nuclear defence policy for this country. This means the rejection of any fresh nuclear bases or weapons on British soil or in British waters, and the removal of all existing nuclear bases and weapons, thus enabling us to make a direct contribution to an eventually much wider nuclear-free zone in Europe. However, all this cannot be done at once, and the way we do it must be designed to assist in the task to which we are also committed - securing nuclear disarmament agreements with other countries and maintaining co operation with our allies.  The most pressing objective must be to prevent the deployment here or elsewhere in Western Europe of Cruise or Pershing missiles. This deployment would mark a new and dangerous escalation in the nuclear arms race. It would make the achievement of effective disarmament agreements covering these and other weapons much more difficult in the future. We will therefore not permit the siting of Cruise missiles in this country and will remove any that are already in place.  The next Labour government will cancel the Trident programme. Apart from the huge, persisting and distorting burden it would impose on our defence budget and our economy as a whole, it would not offer security but would rather help to intensify the arms race. We will propose that Britain's Polaris force be included in the nuclear disarmament negotiations in which Britain must take part. We will, after consultation, carry through in the lifetime of the next parliament our non-nuclear defence policy.  Labour believes in collective security. The next Labour government will maintain its support for NATO, as an instrument of détente no less than of defence. We wish to see NATO itself develop a non-nuclear strategy. We will work towards the establishment of a new security system in Europe based on mutual trust and confidence, and knowledge of the objectives and capabilities of all sides. The ultimate objective of a satisfactory relationship in Europe is the mutual and concurrent phasing out of both NATO and the Warsaw Pact.  We oppose any attempt to expand the role of the alliance into other continents. We condemn the doctrine that nuclear war can be limited, and the notion that somehow the West must catch up with a supposed nuclear superiority in the East. We are opposed to the introduction into Europe of any new nuclear systems such as the neutron bomb. We oppose, too, the storage, research and production of chemical and biological weapons, and call for the withdrawal of all forward stocks of chemical weapons.  Labour will reduce the proportion of the nation's resources devoted to defence so that the burden we bear will be brought into line with that of the other major European NATO countries, without increasing the reliance on nuclear weapons. A Labour government will plan to ensure that savings in military expenditure do not lead to unemployment for those working in defence industries. We shall give material support and encouragement to plans for industrial conversion so that the valuable resources of the defence industries can be used for the production of useful goods.  The emphasis of our defence priorities in the 1980s and 1990s must be to create military forces that are clearly equipped and deployed for defensive purposes, and tailored more to Britain's geography and economic resources. This will mean maintaining adequate conventional forces, at present threatened by the extravagant expenditure on Trident.  We are alarmed by the growth of the arms trade. Labour will limit Britain's arms sales abroad and ban the supply of arms to repressive regimes such as South Africa, El Salvador, Chile, Argentina and Turkey. We will not supply arms to countries where the chances of international aggression or internal repression would be increased. Labour will ensure that all arms sales are under strict ministerial control, subject to parliamentary accountability.  THE COMMONWEALTH AND THE DEVELOPING WORLD  We shall continue to work for the peaceful and just settlement of disputes and the strengthening of international organisations, particularly the Commonwealth, as well as the United Nations. Labour has always attached a special significance to the Commonwealth - a unique forum of nations, cutting across ethnic, cultural and ideological barriers. We will strengthen Britain's political and material commitment to the Commonwealth.  The future prosperity of Britain, as well as that of other industrialised countries, is inextricably linked to the future of the developing world. At the moment some 30 per cent of Britain's manufacturing exports are destined for Third World countries with which we enjoy a very healthy balance of trade. If their economies could be stimulated, the gain would be ours as well as theirs. Countless British jobs have already come about as a consequence of our trading relationship with the poorer countries. That relationship must be strengthened and expanded in the interests of working people both in Britain and overseas.  The war that Labour will wage on poverty in Britain will be extended to the developing world. A primary objective of the next Labour government's foreign policy will be to help revive the North-South dialogue. That some 800,000,000 people should be condemned to a life of absolute poverty in the Third World is an affront to any version of civilised values, as well as a constant threat to international peace and stability.  Labour sets a high priority on attacking the causes of mass poverty. A Labour government will reach the UN sponsored aid target of 0.7 per cent of Gross National Product and work towards a further target of 1.0 per cent. We will also re-establish the principle that aid must be used in the interests of the POOREST PEOPLE IN THE POOREST COUNTRIES and, in our efforts to bring this about, we will fund as appropriate, both governments and independent organisations. Labour will set up once again a separate Ministry of Overseas Development with a cabinet minister.  Labour will plan an expansion of trade with the developing world and will work to bring about changes in the international trading system that will be of benefit to poor countries, allowing them to receive stable prices for their commodity exports and to diversify their production. In trade agreements, Labour will insist upon workers' rights and will bring in legislation to control the activities of British-based multinational companies operating overseas.  Labour believes that, in order to enhance the prospects of the Third World economies, it will be vital to ensure that organisations such as the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund receive adequate funding from the world community, and provide loans in a way that, taking into account the economic difficulties faced by each developing country, will improve the condition of their peoples.  There is much Britain can do to lift people out of absolute poverty, and a Labour Britain will once again speak out in solidarity with the poor and the oppressed everywhere.  We will ensure that provision for overseas students is based on a major expansion of the ODA programme for student sponsorship giving preference to entrants on grounds of origin, income level and availability of courses in Britain and elsewhere.  THE LAW OF THE SEA  Labour welcomes the recently concluded United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea and fully supports the UNCLOS proposal for a new international regime covering every aspect of ocean use. Unlike either the Tory government or the Reagan administration, Labour will endorse the Law of the Sea, which we see as a crucial element in the North-South dialogue, and will ensure that Britain participates actively in the future progress of UNCLOS.  NEAR AND MIDDLE EAST  The Labour Party is committed to the promotion of peace, democracy and socialism in the Middle East, and to the principle of national self-determination. The Arab-Israeli conflict remains a major element in the continuing conflict and tension in the region, through not the only one. The core of the conflict is the struggle between the Israeli and Palestinian peoples for the realisation of national self-determination.  We shall therefore:  - Support the right of all Israelis to live in peace and security in the state of Israel, within secure internationally recognised borders.  - Support the right of Palestinians to self determination, including the establishment of a Palestinian state.  The suffering of the Lebanese people and their continued occupation by foreign forces demands our attention, and we shall work for the restoration of the independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Lebanon, and play a full part in its reconstruction.  The Turkish dictatorship is of special concern to Britain, given Turkish membership of NATO and its status in Europe. We deplore the constitution imposed upon the Turkish people and will work for the restoration of freedom and democracy. Until this is achieved we shall oppose assistance to the Turkish junta.  Labour is deeply concerned by the continuing violation of human rights throughout the Middle East. Labour will do what it can to help those struggling for freedom, democracy, civil and trade union rights.  We support genuine guarantees for the independent, sovereignty and territorial integrity of Cyprus, and the pursuit of intercommunal discussions sponsored by the UN for as long as both communities are committed to those talks.  AFRICA  We are totally opposed to apartheid and will unequivocally support its opponents, giving financial and material assistance to the liberation movements in South Africa and SWAPO of Namibia. Labour will also work with our trade union colleagues to assist the non-racial trade unions in. South Africa.  We will carry through a systematic programme of economic disengagement from South Africa by supporting comprehensive mandatory sanctions at the UN and curtailing our economic relations with the regime. The details of our policy towards Southern Africa are set out in Labour's Programme 1982.  LATIN AMERICA  Latin America is a continent in crisis. The world recession and severe financial difficulties have added to the burden of already frail economies. Democracy is established in very few countries; torture and death are instruments of control in many areas.  Central America is of particular concern. Treated for decades by the United States as its backyard, the countries of this region have almost without exception failed to establish a tradition of representative democracy. Millions of people have endured a lifetime of oppression and deprivation. In recent years, the pressure for social change to respond to basic needs has grown intense, but has met with the firm resistance of the wealthy and the powerful, invariably backed by Washington. This is true of El Salvador, Nicaragua and Guatemala. Labour rejects US policy in Central America. Regrettably, the Tory government has connected Britain with that policy by its slavish support for everything the Reagan administration says and does. This applies even in the case of Guatemala, which the US is re-arming, when it lays claim to Belize, to whose defence we are committed.  Labour will do everything in its power to weaken Latin America's repressive governments by, for example, withdrawing diplomatic representation, opposing multilateral loans, banning arms sales and drawing international attention to human rights violations. Our detailed policy is set out in Labour's Programme 1982.  FALKLAND ISLANDS  Mrs. Thatcher's policy of Fortress Falklands is imposing an intolerable burden both on the British people and on the inhabitants of the Falklands themselves. The war, which wiser policies could have avoided, has already cost us &pound;1,000 million. On top of that the Conservative government plans to spend &pound;600 million a year for the indefinite future on garrisoning the islands - £1 1/2 million per year for every Falklands family.  With four British servicemen on the islands to every adult male Falklander, the traditional way of life of this rural community is being destroyed. Yet at the same time Mrs. Thatcher is allowing British firms to equip warships for the Argentine dictatorship and is lending money to General Bignone to spend on arms. A Labour government would not sell arms to any Argentine government which was hostile to Britain or denied civil rights and democratic freedoms to its own people. Labour believes that Britain must restore normal links between the Falklands and the Latin American mainland, and that the United Nations must be involved in finding a permanent settlement of the problem.  ASIA  Emotional as well as political ties exist between Britain and many of the countries of Asia. It was the 1945 Labour government which gave independence to India and Pakistan.  Labour is concerned about the suppression of human and civil rights in many of the countries of Asia, and we will support every extension of democracy in the region. A Labour government will end military involvement with those countries that have repressive regimes.  The Labour Party is concerned that the Tory policy on overseas students' fees has already affected the ability of students from Asia, as well as elsewhere, to undertake courses in Britain. Steps will be taken to improve the position, as laid out in a previous section.  Labour believes in a closer understanding with China, and hopes that China can become more directly involved in international discussions on peace, disarmament and the world economy. We will hold talks with China with the aim of securing a peaceful and prosperous future for the people of Hong Kong.  Japan is a major power in the world economy. We hope to persuade Japan to play a more active part in a concerted expansion of the economies of the industrial nations, and to remove the obstacles that her trade policies now create. We also hope that Japan will help to bridge the division between North and South by increasing her aid to the Third World.  HUMAN RIGHTS  Labour gives the highest priority to the protection of human dignity, civil rights, democracy and freedom, which will be reflected in all that a Labour government does.  We uphold the rights of all nations to self-determination. Accordingly, we condemn the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan and US support for repressive regimes in Central America. We warn against all military interventions contrary to the UN Charter. We condemn violations of human rights wherever they occur, whether in Poland, Turkey or Nigeria, and whatever the complexion of the government concerned. Labour will further the cause of human rights in all international organisations. We will press for suspension from NATO of any dictatorship.  We will protect the opponents of regimes from harassment by their government's representatives in Britain. Our policy on refugees will be more compassionate than that of the Tory government. We will not deport individuals who would face arrest or death in their own countries.  We will also take into account human rights considerations when giving aid. Official aid will not be given to governments that persistently violate civil and trade union rights. Help will instead be given to the victims of repression."
NA,198306,"Working Together for Britain  PROGRAMME FOR GOVERNMENT  The General Election on June 9th 1983 will be seen as a watershed in British politics. It may be recalled as the fateful day when depression became hopelessness and the slide of the post-war years accelerated into the depths of decline. Alternatively it may be remembered as the turning point when the people of this country, at the eleventh hour, decided to turn their backs on dogma and bitterness and chose a new road of partnership and progress.  It is to offer real hope of a fresh start for Britain that the Alliance between our two parties has been created. What we have done is unique in the history of British parliamentary democracy. Two parties, one with a proud history, and one born only two years ago out of a frustration with the old system of politics, have come together to offer an alternative government pledged to bring the country together again.  The Conservative and Labour parties between them have made an industrial wasteland Out of a country which was once the workshop of the world. Manufacturing output from Britain is back to the level of nearly 20 years ago. Unemployment is still rising and there are now generations of school-leavers who no longer even hope for work. Mrs Thatcher's government stands idly by. hoping that the blind forces of the marketplace will restore the jobs and factories that its indifference has destroyed. The Labour Party's response is massive further nationalisation, a centralised state socialist economy and rigid controls over enterprise. The choice which Tories and Socialists offer at this election is one between neglect and interference. Neither of them understands that it is only by working together in the companies and communities of Britain that we can overcome the economic problems which beset us.  Meanwhile the very fabric of our common life together deteriorates. The record wave of violence and crime and increased personal stress are all signs of a society at war with itself. Rundown cities and declining rural services alike tell a story of a warped sense of priorities by successive governments. Our social services have become bureaucratic and remote from the people they are supposed to serve. Mrs Thatcher promised 'to bring harmony where there is discord'. Instead her own example of confrontation has inflamed the bitterness so many people feel at what has happened to their own lives and local communities.  Our Alliance wants to call a halt to confrontation politics. We believe we have set an example by working together as two separate parties within an alliance of principle. Our whole approach is based on co-operation: not just between our parties but between management and workers, between people of different races and above all between government and people. Because we are not the prisoners of ideology we shall listen to the people we represent and ensure that the good sense of the voters is allowed to illuminate the corridors of Westminster and Whitehall. The TUC and CBI, each paying the bills for the party it supports, have been too much listened to and ordinary people have been heard too little.  We do not believe that all wisdom resides n one party, or even in the two parties of the Alliance. There are men and women of sense and goodwill n both the other parties. But they have opted Out and allowed the demands of the old party politics to make the House of Commons the most noisily partisan assembly in the Western World.  Our concern is for the long-term, not just for tomorrow. We do not want to solve our immediate problems by piling up new crises for future generations. So when we plan for industrial recovery, we are not simply seeking growth for growth's sake. We want an increase in the sort of economic activity which will provide real jobs, which will rebuild our decaying infrastructure, which will conserve energy, and which will re-use and recycle materials rather than wasting them. We want to invest in education and housing since our long-term future depends upon the skill and maturity of the next generation. The lavish promises and the class- war rhetoric of the Conservative and Labour manifestos have no place in our Programme for Government. We offer instead a sober assessment of the first steps back to economic health and social well-being. But the vision which unites us is of a nation of free people working together in harmony, respecting each other's rights and freedom and sharing in each other's success. To achieve these hopes, we must not only change failed policies. We must reform the institutions which produced them.  When we advocate a fairer voting system we are therefore talking neither about a constitutional abstraction nor the self-interest of a new political force. Of course we want fairness for ourselves, but even more do we demand a change in the interests of the majority, whose wishes are increasingly distorted by the pull of the extremes. This is in the interests of the cohesion of the country, for it is wrong and dangerous that one big party should be a stranger to the areas of prosperity and the other an incomprehending alien in the areas of deprivation. It is also in the interests of a more stable political and economic direction, without which those who work in industry, public or private, or in the community services, will not have the framework within which to plan for the future.  We believe that Britain needs the fresh start of the Alliance even more in 1983 than it did in the heady days of our birth in 1981. The Labour Party has not become more moderate. The extremists have been taken out of the shop window; they have not been removed from the shop. The policies of nationalisation, attacks on private enterprise, withdrawal from Europe, with its devastating effect upon our exports and investment prospects, and alienation of our international friends and allies, are all enthroned and inviolate. Jobs and national safety would be at risk.  Mrs Thatcher offers no alternative of hope or of long-term stability. Some of her objectives were good. Britain needed a shake-up: lower inflation, more competitive industry and a prospect of industrial growth to catch back the ground we had lost over the years. But the Government has not succeeded. After a bad start it has got lower inflation, but the prospects even for the end of this year are not good. And the price paid has been appalling. British industry has seen record bankruptcies and liquidations. Unemployment has increased on twice the scale of the world recession.  Prospects for the future are more important than arguing about the failures of the past. The last four years could be forgiven if we now had a springboard for the future. We do not. At best we have a prospect of bumping along the bottom. On present policies the 80's will be a worse decade for unemployment than the 30's. Nearly a half of those without a job in 1933 got one by 1937. By 1987, if we continue as we are, unemployment will be at least as bad as in 1983. As a reaction, if the old two-party system is allowed to continue, we shall then lurch into the most extreme left-wing Government we have ever known.  The Alliance can rescue us from this. There is no need for hopelessness. By giving a moderate and well-directed stimulus to the economy, accompanied by a firm and fair incomes policy, we can change the trend and begin to get people back to work. Unlike the Labour Party. we would do it in a way which encouraged private business. We believe in enterprise and profit, and in sharing the fruits of these.  Beyond that, further success will depend upon the international climate. That is not wholly ours to command. But it does not intimidate us. The world is looking for a lead. Concerted expansion, greater currency stability, a recognition of interdependence between poorer and richer countries are all possible and necessary. We need the vision and sense of enlightened self-interest which produced the Marshall Plan and pulled post-war Europe together.  It is an opportunity for Britain. We yearn for a world role and are qualified by our history and experience to perform one.  The Alliance is unashamedly internationalist. We cannot live in a bunker. We are for a British lead in Europe, for multilateral disarmament and for a new drive to increase our own prosperity by co-operating with others to reduce poverty and squalor throughout the world. We offer reconciliation at home and constructive leadership abroad. We are not ashamed to set our sights high.  DAVID STEEL Leader of the Liberal Party  ROY JENKINS Leader of the Social Democratic Party  THE IMMEDIATE CRISIS: JOBS AND PRICES  Our economic crisis demands tough immediate action. It also requires a Government with the courage to implement those strategic and structural reforms which alone can end the civil war between the two sides of industry.  The immediate priority is to reduce unemployment. Why?  To the Alliance unemployment is a scandal; robbing men and women of their careers, blighting the prospects for a quarter of all our young people, wasting our national resources, aborting our chances of industrial recovery, dividing our nation and fuelling hopelessness and crime.  Much of the present unemployment is a direct result of the civil war in British industry, of restrictive practices and low investment. But in addition Conservative Government policies have caused unemployment to rise. An Alliance Government would cause unemployment to fall. How? Can it be done without releasing a fresh wave of inflation?  We believe it can. We propose a carefully devised and costed jobs programme aimed at reducing unemployment by 1 million over two years. This programme will be supported by immediate measures to help those hardest hit by the slump - the disadvantaged, the pensioners, the poor.  Ours is a programme of mind, heart and will, it is a programme that will work!  The Programme has three points:  - Fiscal and Financial Policies for Growth  - Direct Action to provide jobs  - An Incomes Strategy that will stick.  Sustained Policies for Growth  These will be based on carefully selected increases in public spending and reductions in taxation. Despite the impression Mrs Thatcher gives, the Conservative Government is borrowing £8 billion a year. It is costing us £17 billion to keep over 3 million people on the dole. In view of the depth of the slump, we think it right to increase public borrowing to around £11 billion and to use this money in two basic ways:  - to reverse the reduction in public investment which over the last decade has been little short of catastrophic, through a selective programme of capital investment in the water and sewerage systems, electrification of railways, building and repairing roads, rebuilding and refurbishing hospitals, investing in housing, improving transport services and developing energy conservation schemes.  - to concentrate the funds available for tax reductions in areas where tax cuts have a direct impact on prices such as the abolition of the National Insurance Surcharge (the 'tax on jobs') and in this way keep prices down as growth is stepped up. We will stop the nationalised industries being forced to raise prices for gas and electricity merely to increase Government revenue.  Such action to rekindle growth without inflation, buttressed by a less restrictive monetary policy and management of the exchange rate to keep our exports competitive, will be pursued so as to reduce unemployment by 400,000 over our first two years.  Direct Action to Provide Jobs  The immediate action we propose is targeted on those among the unemployed in greatest need, the long-term unemployed and the young. It does not throw money wildly about, but has been carefully drawn up to achieve the biggest early fall in unemployment we can manage at the lowest practicable cost. Our main proposals are:  - to provide jobs for the long-term unemployed in a programme of housing and environmental improvement - house renovation and insulation, land improvements; these jobs are real jobs crying out to be done. There will also be a major expansion of the Community Programme. We will back programmes of this kind with great determination to ensure that they generate at least 250,000 jobs over two years;  - to extend the Youth Training Scheme so that it is available to all 16 and 17 year olds and give real help to those who want to stay on at school after 16 or go to college or take a training course. Our long term aim is to see all 16-19 year olds either as students with access to work experience, or as employed people with access to education and training. But the extension of training proposed here would alone reduce youth unemployment by 100,000;  - to create more jobs in labour-intensive social services. There is a great need for extra support staff in the NHS and the personal social services. These services are highly labour-intensive and their greatest need for extra people is in regions of high unemployment. We propose the establishment of a special £500 million Fund for the health and social services in order to create an additional 100,000 jobs of this kind over two years;  - to give a financial incentive to private firms to take on those longest out of work - To boost jobs in the private sector, we propose to pay a grant to companies for every extra job they provide and fill with someone unemployed for over six months. The scheme will be for employment pay, not unemployment pay. The Government loses about £100 per week (in unemployment benefit and lost tax revenues) for every person unemployed, so it is not extravagant to pay £80 a week for each additional job. According to the best estimates this incentive could increase employment by around 1 75,000 jobs within two years of its introduction.  In sum, our immediate programme of direct action would reduce unemployment by well over 600,000 in two years. What is more, it will do so in a highly cost-effective way by switching the money which is now paid to people to do nothing, into payment for useful jobs instead, and it therefore will not involve irresponsible increases in public spending or borrowing.  Taken together these proposals should reduce unemployment by 1 million by the end of our second year in government.  An Incomes Strategy That will Stick  We do not pretend that a lasting return to high levels of employment can be achieved painlessly, or without a reemergence of the inflationary pressures which record unemployment has temporarily damped down. We are convinced there is not hope of a lasting return to full employment unless we can develop ways of keeping prices down which do not involve keeping unemployment up. And unlike either of the two old parties, we are prepared to face up to this by pursuing a fair and effective pay and prices policy that will stick. It is Labour's refusal to face up to the need to restrain incomes, at the dictates of its union paymasters, which above all makes Labour's claim to have a solution to unemployment so utterly bogus, and it is Mrs Thatcher's refusal to contemplate anything other than unemployment as an incomes policy which condemns the country to permanently high unemployment if she wins another term.  In drawing up its counter-inflation programme, the Alliance has faced the question of pay and prices policy head on. Unlike other parties, the Alliance will seek a specific mandate from the electorate in support of an incomes policy. We shall campaign for a series of arrangements to keep price rises in check whilst unemployment comes down. Specifically we propose:  - to establish a range for pay settlements. The Government will discuss with representatives of commerce and industry, trade unions and consumers, the prospects for the economy as a whole, and will establish the desirable range within which pay settlements should be negotiated given the outlook for unemployment. The Government will provide forecasts of the implications for unemployment, inflation and growth, of pay settlements at different levels, and the objective will be to arrive each year at an agreed norm or range for pay settlements. In the absence of agreement the government will announce its own view and tailor its policies accordingly, but every effort will be made to minimise disagreement and establish a common view.  - a fair deal for pay in the public services. The agreed norm or range will provide the background to a fair and systematic approach to pay in the public services. A single, independent Assessment Board for public service pay will be set up to provide fair comparisons. Agreed arrangements for arbitration will be needed. As a result, public service sector pay will grow at broadly similar rates to that of comparable groups in the private sector.  - new arrangements to discourage excessive pay settlements in the private sector- Pay settlements in the private sector will be negotiated with no direct interference in settlements made by small and medium sized businesses. We intend to set up a Pay and Prices Commission to monitor pay settlements in large companies, with powers to restrict price increases caused by wage settlements which exceed the agreed range. At the same time, we shall legislate to introduce a Counter Inflation Tax, giving the Government the power to impose the tax if it becomes necessary. The tax will be levied by the Inland Revenue on companies paying above the pay range. It will be open to successful companies where productivity increases have been high to pay above the agreed range if they do so through the distribution of shares which are not immediately marketable.  - the nationalised industries will be subject to similar restraints, on excessive wage settlements; and will not be permitted to evade the consequences of excessive wage settlements and counter-inflation tax payments simply by raising prices.  We would, if we were convinced it was necessary in the prevailing circumstances, be prepared to introduce a fully statutory incomes policy to cover the interim period whilst these new arrangements are being introduced.  Previous incomes policies have been short term reactions to crisis. They have been reversals of earlier policies. They have had no mandate from the electorate. The Alliance presents its policy now because that is both honest and necessary. To work, a pay and prices framework must be understood and supported. The framework we propose can last. It is flexible. It will encourage growth and reward productivity and initiative. It offers the only way of regaining growth without refuelling inflation.  STRATEGY FOR INDUSTRIAL SUCCESS  The Alliance is alone in recognising that Britain's industrial crisis cannot be solved by short term measures such as import controls or money supply targets. Our crisis goes deep. Its roots lie in the class divisions of our society, in the vested interests of the Tory and Labour parties, in the refusal of management and unions to widen democracy in industry, in the way profits and risks are shared.  The policies offered by the two class-based parties will further divide the nation North v South, Management v Labour. Our greatest need is to build a sense of belonging to one community. We are all in it together. It is impossible for one side or the other in Britain to 'win'. Conflict in industrial relations means that we all lose.  But how do we reduce conflict? How do we end class war in industry? Not by intimidating the unions through unemployment. Not by nationalizing, de-nationalizing, re-nationalising. Not by pretending the problem doesn't exist.  The Alliance is committed to policies which will invest resources in the high-technology industries of the future. We are committed to a major new effort in education and training. We are pledged to trade union reform, to tough anti-monopoly measures. Above all we will act to share profits and responsibility in industry far wider than ever before.  We need to do these things to ensure Britain's economic success in a brutally competitive world. But the aim is not merely economic growth for its own sake. To live fulfilled and meaningful lives we each need challenge, reward and responsibility. In British industry far too many feel they have no stake in success, no role to play, nothing to contribute. It is that feeling which leads to bitterness, and conflict. The time has come to change these things - now, before it is too late.  Partnership in Industry  Britain has made little progress towards industrial democracy, yet several of our European partners have long traditions of participation and co-operation backed by legislation. They do not face the obstacles to progress with which our divisive industrial relations present us. To be fully effective, proposals for participation in industry need to be buttressed by action on two fronts: a major extension of profit sharing and worker share-ownership to give people a real stake where they work as well as the ability to participate in decision4aking, and reform of the trades unions to make them genuinely representative institutions.  PARTICIPATION AT WORK  We propose enabling legislation that will offer a flexible and sensible approach:  - an Industrial Democracy Act to provide for the introduction of employee participation at all levels, incentives for employee share-ownership, employee rights to information, and an Industrial Democracy Agency (IDA) to advise on and monitor the introduction of these measures;  - Employee Councils covering each place of work (subject to exemption for small units) for all companies employing over 1,000 people. Smaller companies would also be encouraged to introduce Employee Councils;  - Top level representation will, for example, be through directors elected jointly by employees and shareholders, or a Representative Council with rights to codetermination on a range of issues;  - No 'single channel' appointments by trade unions: every employee must have a vote and be able to exercise it secretly.  PROFIT-SHARING AND EMPLOYEE SHARE-OWNERSHIP  We propose:  - through the Industrial Democracy Act to encourage companies to develop collective share ownership schemes based on profit sharing as an essential component of industrial democracy. We will also increase the exemption limit for Corporation Tax relief on Inland Revenue approved profit-sharing and share-ownership schemes to £3,000 per employee;  - to give specific encouragement to co-operatives through increased funding for the Co operative Development Agency - to provide advice and financial support for those setting up co-operatives.  GIVING THE UNIONS BACK TO THEIR MEMBERS  Employee democracy in industry can only be extended if trade unions are made genuinely representative of their members since they are bound to have an important role in participation. It is for that reason, and not in any spirit of 'union bashing' that we propose further democratization of the unions themselves. We want to see effective, representative and responsible trade unions playing their full part in industry, and in this we stand apart from the Conservative Party, which has no interest in participation, and which wants to reform the unions only in order to weaken them.  We will legislate to provide for:  - compulsory secret individual ballots, normally on a postal basis, for the election of the national executives of unions and, where appropriate, union general secretaries;  - the right for a certain proportion - 10 per cent - of the relevant bargaining unit to require a ballot before an official strike can be called;  - maximum encouragement of arbitration, as a fair and constructive means of settling disputes, including a legal requirement in essential public services that any dispute be taken to impartial arbitration operating on common principles for all public service groups, before industrial action shall commence;  - measures to provide for a more efficient and more effective trade union movement:  - tax exemption for union contributions to encourage a better level of funding, a Trade Union Development Fund to assist union mergers and rationalisation, statutory rights to recognition for unions that have won majority support from the relevant workforce; adequate facilities at the workplace and reasonable time off for union representatives to perform their duties; and increased support for education and training for shop stewards and representatives. We propose an Employees' Charter clearly safeguarding trade union and workers' rights.  We favour a careful balance of collective and individual rights on existing closed shops, with action against the pre-entry closed shop matched by retention of legal provision for union membership agreements on condition the latter rests on substantial workforce support and that exemption from union membership is available on grounds of conscience.  Government and Industry  PRIORITY FOR INDUSTRY  We cannot restore employment or achieve the standards we want in our social services unless we first reverse our industrial decline. So the rebuilding of our industry and commerce must be given priority in the formulation of government policies.  GOVERNMENT AND PRIVATE INDUSTRY  The role of an Alliance government in relation to private industry will be to provide selective assistance taking a number of forms:  - an industrial credit scheme, to provide low-interest, long-term finance for projects directed at modernising industry;  - a national innovation policy, to provide selective assistance for high-risk projects, particularly involving the development of new technologies and for research and development in potential growth industries (with a corresponding reduction in R and D spending on defence);  - public purchasing policies to stimulate innovation, encourage the introduction of crucial technologies and aid small businesses;  - Government assistance in export promotion, with increased efforts to reduce non-tariff barriers to trade;  - we will establish a Cabinet Committee chaired by the Prime Minister at the centre of decision-taking on all policies with a bearing on the performance of industry.  The Alliance will strengthen the Monopolies and Mergers Commission to ensure its ability to prevent monopoly and unhealthy concentrations of industrial and commercial power. The aim is to guarantee fair competition and to protect the interests of employees, consumers and shareholders.  GOVERNMENT AND PUBLIC INDUSTRY  We must get away from the incessant and damaging warfare over the ownership of industry and switch the emphasis to how well it performs. Thus we will retain the present position of British Aerospace but will not privatise British Telecom's main network nor sell off British Airways. But we will make the nationalised industries successful and efficient as well as properly responsible to their consumers. Specifically, we propose that:  - where nationalised industries are operating viably in competitive conditions, Government regulation and control should largely be removed. Their borrowing on the market should not be subject to external financing limits (EFLs), and they should effectively be run as independent enterprises;  - where public industries are not subject to market forces - e.g. the public utilities - or where they are dependent on public finance - e.g. the railways - alternative means of exerting pressure to ensure operational efficiency are required, and we will set up an Efficiency Audit Commission to report regularly and publicly to a Select Committee of Parliament on the overall management and discharge of their responsibilities by the industries concerned;  - we will seek to distance the Government from direct involvement in nationalised industries. They must be free to run their industries according to the criteria laid down for them, without political interference.  NEW AND SMALL BUSINESSES  To encourage the growth of new and small businesses, we will attack red tape and provide further financial and management assistance by:  - extending the Loan Guarantee Scheme, in the first instance raising the maximum permitted loan to £1 50,000; and the Business Start-Up Scheme, raising the upper limit for investment to £75,000; and introducing Small Firm Investment Companies to provide financial and management help;  - zero-rating building repairs and maintenance for VAT purposes and reducing commercial rates by 10 per cent;  - making sure the Department of Industry co-ordinates and publicises schemes for small businesses and that government aid ceases to discriminate against small businesses;  - tailoring national legislation such as the Health and Safety Regulations to the needs of small businesses and amending the statutory sick pay scheme to exclude small businesses.  AGRICULTURE AND FISHERIES  Agriculture is an important industry and employer. To encourage its further development we will:  - increase Government support for effective agricultural marketing at home and abroad and continue support for 'Food from Britain';  - ensure that agriculture has access like other industries to the industrial credit scheme we propose;  - encourage greater access to farming, especially by young entrants.  We believe that the provision of alternative sources of employment is the key to many other problems of the rural areas. To this end, we will promote moves at local level to establish rural development agencies.  The Alliance is determined to safeguard the future of our fishing industry which needs help to re-build after years of uncertainty and the drastic consequences for the deep-sea fleet of 200-mile limits in the waters they used to fish. We believe:  - that in order to conserve stocks for the future, EEC inspection must be strengthened to ensure that conservation measures are fairly enforced on the fleets of all member states;  - that better marketing and promotion, better vocational training, and reasonable credit terms would all help the future of the industry;  - that government measures must take account of the special importance of our inshore industry to rural communities.  ENERGY  The first priority of the Alliance energy policy is the conservation and efficient use of energy. A programme of house insulation is part of our jobs plan and a programme to encourage increased energy efficiency in industry will lead to a substantial increase in employment and savings to the economy.  For the foreseeable future, coal will continue to supply a large part of our major energy needs. To ensure the continued prosperity of the coal industry we will make substantial investments in the modernisation of techniques and capacity. This does not mean a dramatic schedule of pit closures. There will be some employment problems - where the oldest deep pits are coming to the end of their economic life. The Alliance plans for jobs and industry are designed to give particular help to areas like these where new employment is needed.  The North Sea currently produces the oil and gas we need. But we want to make sure that there are enough reserves to keep up British oil and gas production. So we will encourage the exploration for and development of new reserves. We want to link Britain up by pipeline with the rest of the North Sea gas-fields so that, together with our European partners, we can make the best use of the gas that is there.  We will invest as a matter of urgent priority in different types of energy and new technologies, especially the use of sources of energy like the sun, wind, waves and the heat below the earth's surface and the development of combined heat and power systems. We are determined to maintain a British power plant industry.  The power stations we have and are currently building will be enough for our needs for some considerable time to come. We see no evidence including anything yet submitted to the Enquiry to justify the building of Sizewell or other PWR generating stations. However research into nuclear waste disposal must be continued in order to cater for existing needs and we would develop Britain's research programme and expertise in the field of nuclear power and the possibilities presented by fast-breeder technology and fusion.  Education and Training  The third basic condition for industrial success is a people with the skills and self- confidence that will be needed for the challenges of new technology. The education and training systems are not providing enough people with the skills necessary to make them employable and the country successful in competition with its rivals. We are falling further behind. Japan on present plans will be educating all its young people to the age of 18 by 1990. More than 90 per cent of the 16-19 age group in Germany gain recognised technical qualifications. And it is not just a matter of school-leavers. Our managers are less professionally qualified than our main competitors'. From the bottom to top we are underskilled, and this has to be put right if we are to prosper in future. To do this, to raise standards in education and training and to improve their effectiveness, is the object of proposals set out in the next Section.  CREATING ONE COMMUNITY  A fundamental purpose of the Alliance is to reduce the divisions which over the last two decades have been fragmenting our society, and restore our sense of being one community.  The gap between rich and poor is as wide today as it was forty years ago when the Beveridge Report was written. There has been a big increase in poverty and urban squalor as a result of the present slump. The pressures of the recession have placed an increasing burden on women in particular. The trend towards two nations in health, education and the social services is accelerating as those who can pay increasingly opt for private provision.  To combat these trends will require determined action across a wide front:  - immediate help for those bearing the burden of unemployment;  - a determined attack on poverty, aimed at releasing those locked in the poverty trap, by raising the living standards of the hardest-pressed families;  - action to raise standards in education and the quality of health care provided by the NHS and remove the inadequacies in the state services which lie behind the trend to private provision;  - increased investment in housing, drawing on wider sources of finance to build new communities of mixed ownership, together with urgent attention to the rehabilitation of existing council estates, the decentralisation of housing management and tenants' rights;  - giving serious priority to the environmental aspects of actions and policy changes at the earliest possible stage;  - creating one nation will also require positive action to tilt the balance more in favour of disadvantaged and depressed minority groups and to focus assistance on inner city areas.  This must be backed by firm action to strengthen the rule of law, with support for an effective police force commanding the confidence of the community in the fight against vandalism and crime.  Immediate Help for Those in Need  The burden of the slump is being borne quite disproportionately by those now in long- term unemployment and by the poor, especially poor families with children. We propose to take the following measures straight away:  a) help for families with children by increasing Child Benefit by £1.50 per week; increasing the Child Allowance in Supplementary Benefit by £1.50 per week; increasing the extra child allowance of one-parent families;  b) help for pensioners. We will up-rate the pension twice a year because the present system gives rise to serious injustices. We will make sure pensioners can earn money without losing pension; we will increase the death grant to £250 for those of lesser means; standing charges for gas, electricity and basic telephone services will be abolished;  c) help for the unemployed and sick by increasing Unemployment Benefit, Sickness Benefit and sick pay by 5 per cent; giving long-term Supplementary Benefit to the long-term unemployed; changing the rules so people are not forced to spend their redundancy money before they can get Supplementary Benefit;  d) help for the disabled by spending an extra £200 million a year to make a start on many reforms which will help disabled people. These will include the extension of the invalid care allowance and full rights under the non-contributory invalidity pension to married women and the abolition of the age limit on the mobility allowance;  e) finance. The total cost of these proposals is approximately £1 ,750m. This will be financed by: raising the upper limit at which National Insurance contributions are paid to £31 5 per week; reversing the recent increases in the high rate tax bands; and by the first stage of phasing out the married man's tax allowance. Therefore this programme does not require an increase in public borrowing.  Attacking Poverty  The Alliance proposes to carry through a major overhaul of the welfare system. The original grand design of the liberal reformer, William Beveridge, has been mutilated over the years. Instead of a basic benefit, which was to secure for the old, the sick and the unemployed, a tolerable minimum standard of living as of right, we have a complex network of benefits dependent on 44 different means tests. Many people are dependent on benefits which are woefully inadequate. Millions are in poverty because they fail to apply for benefits to which they are entitled. Others find that they are worse off if they earn more.  Mass unemployment has made the scale of our problems greater than at any time since the war. We believe that we can offer a better, simpler structure of social security which would be the most important reform since Beveridge.  In the long term, we plan a complete integration of the tax and benefit systems. We aim in the next Parliament to bring together all the major benefits - Family Income Supplement, housing benefits, free school meals, Supplementary Benefit, and to replace them with a simpler, single benefit, the size of which for each family will depend basically on the number of children and their housing costs.  The levels of benefit we propose mean that:  - a working family with two children, currently earning £100 per week, will be around £24 per week better off;  - single parents with two children, currently helped by Supplementary Benefit, will be around £10 per week better off;  - single pensioners only getting the state pension will be £5.50 per week better off, and pensioner couples in the same position £10 per week better off;  - help will especially be concentrated on poor families with children since these are the real centres of hardship.  The benefit will be used to supplement people's income - whether from a job, unemployment or sickness benefit or a pension - and the amount people actually get will depend on their income. The benefit will be gradually withdrawn as incomes rise - but in a steady way so that as people earn more they do end up better off despite the reduction of benefit - and the overall effect will be a substantial boost to the incomes of those suffering most hardship.  The additional spending which the new welfare system will involve will be paid for from three sources. First by the continued phasing Out of the married man's extra tax allowance (over at least three years}. This is part of the removal of sex discrimination in taxation and will allow us to introduce the principle of separate taxation of earned income for all men and women. Second, by not fully indexing personal tax allowances, and third, by a relatively small increase in public borrowing - around £600-£700 million over the final programme.  This attack on poverty is basic to the Alliance strategy for creating in Britain a more united and caring community. The Conservatives speak only of an efficient and competitive society. We seek a civilized community using the resources provided by a revived economy to guarantee to all the security and self-respect that are every citizen's right.  Education, Health and Housing  Building a united, civilized community requires decent standards in education, health and housing for everyone. The Tories have imposed savage cuts in the social services and an Alliance Government would increase spending to restore and improve standards.  But it will not be enough just to spend money. The social services are too centralised, too bureaucratic. They are often insensitive and unaccountable. We will aim to make the social services more democratic, attuned to the needs of the individual. In this way, also, they will become more efficient.  EDUCATION AND TRAINING  The principal need in education and training is to release the full potential of the individual. It is on the skills and energies of our people that our survival depends. An increasingly complex and technical society places great demands on the educational system and as falling school numbers continue to release resources these must not be withdrawn but invested to create better education opportunities.  The needs of the under-fives have to be met by both education and the social services.  - We will ensure that at least one year of pre-school educational experience is available for all children under five;  - We will act to raise standards in the primary and secondary schools in three ways:  - i) by involving parents, teachers and local people more in the running of schools - these are the people who really care about standards;  - ii) by ensuring that children study a broader range of subjects than they do now right through to eighteen, putting more stress on maths, science and technical subjects as well as practical skills to make them better equipped for life in today's world. It is especially important to ensure that these opportunities are equally available to girls as well as boys;  - iii) by improving the in-service training of primary teachers and of others with specialist skills e.g. in maths.  - we will develop a broader bridge between school and work including more part-time schooling, and more work experience and better technical education for all pupils;  - we will undertake a major re-organisation of education and training for the 16-19s, so that school leavers are not faced with the dole but can opt for either education and training or employment or a combination of the two. Present arrangements are disjointed. Britain is well behind its competitors, resources have been devoted to ad hoc schemes not necessarily leading to employment, and many young people are unable to acquire skills and qualifications. So we propose:  - i) a single Ministry of Education and Training combining the youth training functions of the MSC and the responsibilities of the Education Departments,  - ii) full-time vocational courses offering sustained and properly planned periods of work experience, and the replacement of the time-served apprenticeship with training to set national standards,  - iii) greater access to work experience for all 16-19 year old students and a right to further education and training for those of this age-group in work,  - iv) expansion of the YTS to enable all 17 year olds not covered by the above to participate in a Government training scheme,  - v) a new system of educational maintenance allowances to ensure that help is available to those who stay on at school, those who opt for further education and those who opt for further training.  - we will increase access to Higher and Further Education. We shall also review the structure of higher education to see that people who are keen to work in industry are provided with the right range of skills at this level. This may mean for example students typically taking a wider range of courses before moving on to a job or more specialist education;  - we will actively support Adult and Continuing Education. Initial education alone cannot prepare people adequately for life. It must be made easier for them as part of their normal development to acquire new skills and to re4rain as technology advances.  - we will ensure further public support for the voluntary and statutory sectors of the youth service.  Improvement in training facilities provided by the State will be accompanied by fiscal and other incentives to companies to increase their training efforts.  HEALTH AND SOCIAL SERVICES  The Alliance is wholly committed to sustaining and strengthening the NHS. The Health Service must be funded to ensure that extra help goes to those most in need and that sufficient resources are available to meet the needs of our ageing population. The Alliance is committed to the steady increase in the real level of funding for the health and personal social services required to maintain standards in the face of demographic changes such as the increasing numbers of old people.  In addition, the Alliance will set up a special Fund with £500 million each year to pay for new schemes and ideas submitted by area health authorities, local authorities and other voluntary organisations to help the poorest areas and the neediest people. The funding of this scheme will count as part of the Alliance's immediate employment programme, and employment as well as other criteria will govern the choice of projects by the fund. The areas of greatest need in the health and social services are also high unemployment areas, so that such a special fund is an ideal use of available money.  Within the health programme, action will be taken to make better use of the health budget by:  - increased emphasis on primary care, health education and preventive medicine;  - emphasising community care, not as a cheap option but because of the improved quality of care this brings;  - re-allocating funds between areas and between users to increase equality of access to services for people in need whatever their means or wherever they happen to live. Particular attention will be given to the traditionally under-funded services such as those for the elderly, the chronically disabled and the mentally handicapped;  - encouraging local experiments and plans to improve services;  - reducing the drugs bill by extending the practice of generic prescribing, saving over one hundred million pounds.  The quality of care will also be improved by our policies in three related areas. First, the continuing commitment of all NHS staff is vital if the health service is to deliver the best care it can. This means NHS staff must be properly and fairly treated. We gave our commitment in Section II to determine pay in the public services by a new system based on fair comparison with other groups and a fair arbitration procedure which will also apply to NHS staff. Second, we will pay far more attention to prevention of accidents, illness and stress, making sure that health and safety legislation is properly applied and reducing environmental risks, for example by removing lead in petrol. Third, we will work for much closer co-operation between public and private services, to maximise the amount and coverage of health care available to the community as a whole. As with private schools, we have no wish to ban private health services, but nor will we subsidise them.  In the personal social services, the Alliance is determined to make the welfare state less bureaucratic and more responsive to people's needs, charting a more imaginative way forward by creating community-orientated services, incorporating a much greater degree of voluntary effort, and making much better use of the dedication and enthusiasm of professional staff, working with and through voluntary groups. We favour caring for people in the community for example, helping the elderly to live among family friends and neighbours. We will support and sustain the family, in particular by helping those, especially women, who carry the burden of this care. We will encourage the development of supportive care in the community for children through a wide range of facilities including pre-school play schemes and nursery centres, and will support training for child-minders. Imaginative grants can produce value for money and high community involvement.  HOUSING  Housing standards have fallen under the Tory Government, and fewer houses have been built. Council tenants have been able to buy their own houses but face almost impossible financial difficulties if trying to move out of council estates into private housing.  Alliance housing policy has three basic aims: to restore the housing stock where this is needed, to provide wider genuine choice for consumers and to allocate available funds with greater fairness.  This will mean increased investment. Bntain's building industry has been one of the worst hit by the recession. 1 in 8 of the unemployed are in construction. Higher investment here will not only help the tenant, the home buyer and the home-owner: it will help the whole country by creating jobs and boosting the economy.  INVESTMENT There is an urgent need for increased investment in housing. The Housing Programme has suffered more than any other under this government, falling in cash terms from £4,514m in 1979-80 to £2,792m now which represents a fall of almost two-thirds in real terms. The all-party Environment Select Committee predicts a shortage of nearly half a million houses by 1985. And not enough is being spent even to maintain the standard of existing houses. More than 2 million houses are now 'unfit for habitation' or 'in serious disrepair', and the figure is rising.  We propose:  - a steady expansion of local Council and housing association building programmes, particularly for the single and the elderly, local council programmes to be in low density, human scale developments;  - vigorous programmes of repair, improvement and rehabilitation of existing Council estates;  - scrapping VAT on repairs;  - maximum use of improvement grants to the private sector with particular help for elderly owner-occupiers who face difficulties in maintaining their houses;  - attracting institutional investment in a new type of non-profit making rented housing to be managed by housing associations;  - encouraging partnership schemes between local councils and private builders to provide houses to rent; and low cost house ownership opportunities on the same estates.  The last two proposals will involve new non-public money in housing, and cut down the public expenditure costs of increasing housing investment.  WIDENING CHOICE IN HOUSING We propose:  - changing council allocation and transfer procedures to give tenants far more choice about where they live;  - encouraging shared purchase and other schemes which bring owner occupation within the reach of lower income families;  - providing new sources of rented housing to compete with local councils;  - breaking up the large monolithic council housing departments into Neighbourhood Housing Trusts run jointly by tenants and Council representatives;  - decentralising the management of the remaining Council housing to local offices responsible to local boards composed of Councillors and tenants;  - introducing a new Tenants Charter to define standards of repairs, maintenance and amenities to which tenants are entitled;  - giving tenants the right to call in an outside contractor from an approved list when they are dissatisfied with the Council's performance on repairs and sending the bill to the Council;  - establishing a single national scheme to help tenants wanting to move from one area to another.  The Right to Buy should be retained. After the introduction of proportional representation and hence greater accountability. Councils could be given more discretion to decide their housing policy. However, there should be a right of appeal in which Councils would justify to the Local Government Ombudsman any proposed restriction on the individual's right to buy such as in areas of housing need or in certain rural areas where cheap rented housing is necessary to keep an adequate proportion of young people in the community.  MAJOR EXTENSION OF THE CAPITAL HOME LOAN SCHEME At present this scheme to help first time buyers is a paltry thing adding at most £110 capital for £1,000 saved by the buyer. The Alliance wants to give far more substantial aid to those determined to buy their own homes but without the means to do so under present arrangements.  We will extend the scheme so that anyone saving £1,000 over 2 years will receive an extra £1,000 at the end of that period. Rents paid over more than five years by Council tenants will count as equivalent to £1,000 savings and will also qualify for the additional £1,000.10 years rent will entitle the tenant to £1,500 and 15 years to £2,000. We will seek to devise similar arrangements for private tenants.  Of course the present limits on the maximum value of properties which can qualify for such assistance will be maintained. The scheme is to help those who cannot otherwise become home-owners, not to benefit those with adequate resources. This will be strictly enforced.  This measure is imaginative and bold. It opens up new prospects and hope for many who are determined to save and work for a better way of life.  GREATER FAIRNESS Housing subsidies must be distributed more according to need. Council tenants have been particularly hard hit by the government's policy of deliberately forcing up rents far faster than the rate of inflation. Central government subsidies to local authority housing fell from £1 ,274m in 1980/81 to £370m in 1983/84 with the result that in most parts of the country. housing accounts are now moving into surplus. The Alliance says this process must stop. Council rents should be fixed so that housing accounts balance. Any surplus should be reinvested in improved management and maintenance, and not used to subsidise the general rates.  For owner-occupiers, the Alliance's long-term policy is to reform mortgage tax relief so that it relates to individual income rather than the size of the loan. In the meantime, tax relief will be limited to the standard rate of income tax. The Alliance also intends to encourage 'low start' mortgages and other schemes to bring home-ownership within the reach of more people.  The Environment  There can be no healthy economy without a healthy environment. For far too long we have been wasting irreplaceable resources and amenities, both natural and manmade on which our community's prosperity and well-being depend. In all public decision-making the environmental aspects of changes should be assessed and taken into account from the beginning.  POLLUTION  We endorse the 'Polluter Pays' principle - that those responsible for pollution should pay for the resultant environmental damage. Existing pollution control legislation must be enforced and extended as recommended by the Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution.  LIMITING WASTE  We will encourage the manufacture of products to last longer than at present and the manufacture of those goods which cannot be re-used from materials which can be re-cycled. We will provide financial incentives for authorities with responsibility for waste disposal to construct new plants to re-cycle waste material.  Transport  Without an effective public transport system the environment will suffer serious damage and energy resources will be wasted. We believe that new investment should be linked with modernised operating practices to ensure a future for our railways, and we therefore reject the negative philosophy of the Serpell Report. Careful planning and co-ordination is required to meet the different public transport needs of both the cities and the countryside.  Land Use  We need a fundamental change in the way in which we plan our cities, towns and villages to develop greater participation by those directly affected, to protect, create and develop living communities.  Farming and Conservation  We will give increased responsibility to local bodies representative of farming and environmental interests which would be based on the present Farming and Wildlife Advisory Groups, in the award of agricultural grants and subsidies, and which would seek to reconcile different interests in the use of land.  Animal Welfare  Cruelty to animals and unnecessary suffering by animals demean our society and the Alliance would, as a matter of priority, establish an advisory Standing Commission on Animal Welfare. This would keep under constant and rigorous examination all issues of animal welfare including experimentation on live animals, the treatment of farm animals, the transportation of animals and the regulations covering the use of animals for entertainment. A caring community must care for animals as well as for human beings.  TRANSFORMING THE POLITICAL SYSTEM  Electoral Reform  The introduction of Proportional Representation is the linchpin of our entire programme of radical reform. Alone of the political parties the Liberal Party and the SDP recognise that our economic crisis is rooted in our political system. As class based parties, Labour and Conservative represent and intensify our divisions. The 'first-past-the-post' voting system ensures the under-representation of all those who reject class as the basis of politics. Electoral reform is thus a pre-condition of healing Britain's divisions and creating a sense of community. It is also a change we must make if we are, in the full sense of the word, to be a democracy.  The national interest demands electoral reform. The Alliance will not hesitate to use its strength in the next Parliament to ensure the introduction of a system which will strengthen the power of the voters.  A system based on proportional representation will provide a stable political framework in two ways. First, in order to form a government, political parties combining together will need to command the support of about half the voters. The policies such a government will pursue can only be less dogmatic and extreme than those likely to be followed under our present system where governments can be elected with the support of no more than one quarter of the electorate. Secondly, the political parties will have to aim much more for the centre ground and will be much more reluctant to adopt the divisive policies we see at present.  Specifically we propose to:  - replace the existing electoral system with a system of Community Proportional Representation. It will be based on multi-member constituencies which correspond to natural communities. It will use a system of preferential voting under which people list candidates in the order of their choice. The outcome will be that the share of seats gained by the parties in Parliament will reflect their support among the voters.  Thus natural communities like cities (e.g. Hull, Plymouth, Leeds, Edinburgh), and counties (e.g. Somerset, Northumberland) will be single multi-member constituencies of different size, represented by different numbers of MPs. Preferential voting by single transferable vote (STV} will enable the voter to distinguish between candidates of a particular party and thus to affect the character of that Party in Parliament. A single Party will not be able to gain a parliamentary majority unless it secures nearly 50 per cent of the votes. There will be a spread of representation in every part of the country and we will see the end of the increasing political polarisation between North and South.  Electoral reform is no academic matter. While this is our preferred system it is not the only acceptable system of fairer voting. It is necessary to strengthen and restore faith in our democratic process, under which the relationship between seats and votes is becoming entirely arbitrary. A switch to proportional representation will transform the character of our politics, producing a more constructive political dialogue, and it will change the nature of the policies pursued by successive governments. As the fundamental reform required for continuity of policy - crucial if we are gradually and steadily to overcome our basic economic problems - it is no less than the precondition for economic recovery and future prosperity.  Decentralising Government  In addition to electoral reform, the Alliance is committed to two further constitutional reforms: decentralisation to make government more accountable to the electorate, and basic legislation to protect fundamental human rights and freedoms.  Our system of government is inefficient because it is over-centralised. Departments, Ministers and Parliament are hopelessly overloaded and Parliament cannot adequately control the executive; there is great reliance on non-elected quangos, particularly at regional level - such as Regional Health Authorities, and Regional Water Authorities which together with the regional 'outposts' of central government departments now constitute an undemocratic regional tier of government; local government is too dependent on and dominated by central government - which has eroded not only its independence but also its sense of responsibility - and the Tories have made the spending of individual local authorities subject to central control. The overall result is lack of efficiency and lack of accountability, and the concentration of political power in London leads to a concentration of economic power there too, accentuating the trend to two nations - a relatively prosperous South, and a relatively deprived North. We need to disperse power in order to help spread prosperity.  In the light of these deficiencies in the structure of government, we propose:  - to transfer substantial powers and responsibilities, currently exercised by the centre, to the nations and regions of Britain. The demand for devolution is clearly stronger in Scotland than in Wales or in some of the English regions, and we do not believe that devolution should be imposed on nations or regions which do not wish it. But there is a strong practical case, especially in terms of regional development, for relevant public expenditure to be allocated between and within regions in line with regional needs. We therefore propose:  - a) immediate action to set up a Scottish Parliament with a full range of devolved powers, including powers to assist economic development and powers to tax, but not to run a Budget deficit;  - b) to enact Scottish devolution in an Act which would also provide the framework for decentralisation to assemblies in Wales and the English regions as demand develops;  - c) in the English regions to set up economic development agencies with substantial powers. To make these development agencies, and other nominated regional authorities which already exist, accountable in the first instance to regional committees of a reformed Second Chamber.  - d) in Northern Ireland to encourage a non-sectarian approach to the problems of the province. We support the present Northern Ireland Assembly and will work towards a return to devolved power in place of direct rule from Westminster. We favour the early establishment of an Anglo-Irish consultative body at parliamentary level representing all parties at Westminster, Belfast and Dublin.  - to revitalise local government, restoring its independence and its accountability to the local electorate by:  - a) introducing proportional representation at local level to make local government representative of its electorate and responsive to currents of opinion in that electorate;  - b) simplifying the structure of local government to make it more effective by abolishing one of the existing tiers of local government. This will be done by stages against the background of our proposals for the development of regional government. It would inevitably involve the eventual abolition of the Metropolitan Counties, and the GLC (but not ILEA) and would also allow for the restoration of powers to some of the former County boroughs;  - c) paving the way to the abolition of domestic rates and reducing local government's dependence on central grant, by introducing a local income tax. This change in the structure of local government finance will increase the independence of local government;  - d) extending the right of local communities to have statutory Parish or Neighbourhood Councils.  - to increase the accountability of Government to Parliament by reforming the operation and procedures of the House of Commons, to make its control of the executive more effective and to reform the powers and composition of the House of Lords, which must include a significant elected element representative of the nations and regions of Britain.  This set of proposals amounts to an extensive decentralisation of power from the centre, both to the nations and regions and to local government, and to considerable strengthening of democratic accountability at all levels of government.  Promoting Individual Rights  Resting on our laurels as the oldest modern democracy, we have become smug and complacent with the result that the rights we have taken for granted are being increasingly threatened. The third major area of constitutional reform therefore includes a series of measures to buttress our now shaky structure of liberties and rights and guarantee them by law. Changes in the power of the State, the media and in technology require specific protection of rights by statute. Such action will be coupled with determined action to strengthen the rule of law, giving full backing to the police subject to a proper system of accountability.  INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS  The following are our proposals:  - a new Bill of Rights. It is shaming that our citizens have so frequently had to go to the European Court to have basic rights enforced. We shall incorporate the rights and freedoms of the European Convention of Human Rights into English, Scottish and Northern Ireland law by means of a new Bill of Rights Act which will be paramount over all inconsistent statutes and common law.  - we shall create a UK Commission of Human Rights to help people bring proceedings under the Bill of Rights to secure compliance with its provisions. This will incorporate the existing Equal Opportunities Commission and Commission for Racial Equality and will deal with discrimination on grounds of sex or race;  - the Alliance believes that sex and race equality are fundamental to our society. they will be promoted by positive action in relation e.g. to public employment policies which will be monitored in central and local government. Anti-discrimination legislation will be actively enforced;  - nationality and immigration: we believe the British Nationality Act 1981 to be offensive and discriminatory. We will revert to the simple concept that all those born in Britain are entitled to British Citizenship. There should be objective tests for citizenship and a right of appeal against refusal. Immigration controls will be applied without discrimination on grounds of sex, race or colour, and rules on dependents will be revised to promote family unity;  - we shall legislate for public access to official information, including the right of individuals to have access to information on themselves, subject to a Code of Practice defining exceptions and limitations;  - we support state financing of political parties. Trade Union members must have the right to 'contract-in' on the political levy and to determine their union's party political affiliation by secret postal ballot. There should be equivalent action to regulate company donations to political parties.  The Rule of Law  We are dedicated to extending individual rights but rights also carry responsibilities. We need to restore our traditions of responsible citizenship. There is great concern about rising crime. The number of serious cases has this year risen above 3 million for the first time in our history. The rise in the crime rate has accompanied the rise in unemployment. As the Conservative Government has put more and more men and women out of work, the family has been undermined, whole communities have lost their self-respect and good and neighbourly values have been forgotten. Many citizens now live in terror of the vandal, the mugger and the thief. Old people in particular are cruelly exposed to violence and abuse. The causes of crime are complex but we all have an obligation to resist the dangerous slide to lawlessness that has brought fear to our streets. The Alliance believes that it is vital to support and reinforce the police in their efforts to prevent and detect crime.  But policing can only be effective if it is responsive to and carries the support and confidence of local communities. We therefore propose:  - to support community policing with local policemen on the beat and living locally, small local police stations and reforms to police recruitment and training policy;  - support for local liaison committees which will involve local people in helping the police to do their job;  - to enhance confidence in the police by introducing a conciliation service and an independent system for the investigation of serious complaints. We will establish a new police disciplinary offence of racially prejudiced behaviour and introduce lay visitors into police stations;  - to improve police accountability outside London by strengthening the community element on Police Authorities and encouraging community representation at the level of police divisions. For the Metropolitan Police, we shall as an interim measure establish a Select Committee drawn from London MPs.  Action to protect and promote individual and minority rights is an essential part of the Alliance's determination to heal division and enhance Britain's awareness of being one, inter dependent Community. Prejudice against racial and other minorities, discrimination against them and against women in job opportunities and in pay, all threaten the creation of this community. The Alliance is born of Liberal and Social Democratic values. In government it would be true to those values.  The Alliance recognises that the expansion of television technology through cable, video cassettes and satellite offers great opportunities in the creation of a better informed society and provides new opportunities for the Arts.  However these technologies also carry dangers to our society if they become vehicles for pornography and violence. This must not be allowed to happen, and the State must have particular regard to its responsibilities for the young.  PEACE AND SECURITY  Alliance policies in the field of foreign policy and defence are uncompromisingly internationalist. They are based on the view that Britain must play a full and leading role in the community of nations.  The Alliance holds that Britain's security as a country depends on the cohesion and effectiveness of the NATO alliance; that our political and economic interests require us to play our full part in the European Community, and that the poorest countries of the world can best be helped if the industrial nations pursue more expansionary economic policies in concert.  The Alliance's commitment to internationalism and its recognition of the inter dependence of nations clearly differentiates its approach from that of both the Labour and Tory parties. In a dangerous and complex world there is a temptation to withdraw into narrow and nationalistic attitudes. This is what both the class-based parties have done.  Labour is now pledged to policies which would isolate and weaken Britain - import controls, unilateral withdrawal from the EEC, one-sided disarmament. If these policies were enacted our Allies would lose all confidence in us, the Western Alliance would be badly undermined and as an economically debilitated and less influential country we would be quite unable to launch the international initiatives now desperately needed to help the poor of the world through concerted economic expansion and aid.  The Conservative Party specifically refuses to recognise the true inter-dependence of nations in its approach to both development and peace. It has failed utterly 10 respond to the challenge of the Brandt Report. Their refusal to countenance the inclusion of Britain's nuclear systems in any disarmament negotiations displays their lack of real commitment to multilateral disarmament; their determination to spend vast sums on Trident betrays their lack of confidence in any commitment to our alliance with the United States.  The Alliance sees little prospect for progress towards a more peaceful, prosperous and just world unless inter-dependence is accepted as the basis of international relations. This leads us to radically different policies from those advocated by the class based parties in three key areas:  Defence and Disarmament  The Alliance believes Britain must be properly defended and our forces equipped for that task. We pay tribute to the courage and determination of our armed forces in the Falklands and in Northern Ireland. Our defence policies reject both Labour's one-sided disarmament and the Conservatives' escalation of the nuclear arms race. The main points of our policies for defence are:  - to adhere firmly to the principles of collective security. Britain cannot defend herself alone, and the NATO Alliance has made a decisive contribution to the maintenance of peace in Europe. Participation in NATO must be the cornerstone of the country's defence policy, and in order to consolidate the NATO Alliance we reaffirm our commitment to the NATO target for strengthening conventional forces in Europe;  - we accept the need for a nuclear component in the NATO deterrent whilst the USSR has nuclear weapons. NATO should however move away from its present excessive dependence on the early use of nuclear weapons. We therefore support raising the nuclear threshold in Europe and moving towards a 'no first use' policy by strengthening NATO's conventional forces and establishing a 150km Battlefield Nuclear Weapon- Free Zone at the central front. An Alliance Government would regard such a zone as the basis for negotiations with the Russians on a wider verifiable nuclear weapon-free zone;  - we strongly back multilateral disarmament and arms control efforts, in particular the Geneva negotiations for reduction in both sides strategic (START) and the intermediate range (INF) nuclear weapons. More specifically, the START and INF talks should be merged or at least closely linked so that trade-offs can be made across weapons systems: Trident should be cancelled to avoid a new and provocative contribution to the nuclear arms race and demonstrate our commitment to arms control; Polaris should be included in the merged START and INF talks as a further contribution to the prospects of multilateral disarmament.  - the Geneva negotiations should be pursued to a successful conclusion. Before deciding whether or not to oppose the deployment of Cruise missiles in Britain, an Alliance Government will take account in particular, of the negotiating position of the Soviet Union and the United States; the attitude of our NATO partners in Europe; and whether arrangements for a double safety-catch system have been agreed;  - if successful progress in nuclear weapons reductions has not been achieved in the negotiations at Geneva, an Alliance Government will explore the opportunities for a verifiable, mutual freeze on the production and deployment of all nuclear weapons;  - we strongly support an agreement between East and West to ban the production and possession of chemical weapons and we would work for mutual and balanced force reductions in Europe and a comprehensive test ban to strengthen the Non-Proliferation Treaty;  - on international security, we support the recommendations in the Palme Report, and wish to see the UN's peace-keeping role strengthened, and increased powers given to the UN Secretary-General. An Alliance Government will press for a European initiative to register the sale of arms to third world countries, and will act to end sales of British arms to regimes which persistently and brutally violate human rights.  This set of policies - stressing disarmament on both sides, a nuclear weapon-free zone in Europe, strengthened conventional forces for NATO and reduced NATO reliance on nuclear weapons, the cancellation of Trident and the inclusion of Polaris in disarmament negotiations - will reduce the danger of nuclear conflict and increase Britain's security.  Membership of the European Community  The Alliance is wholly committed to continuing UK membership of the European Community. Membership has increased our political influence with our European neighbours and in the world beyond. Continued membership is also unequivocally to our economic advantage. The community is by far Britain's largest trading partner, with over half of our exports going to community countries or countries with whom they have Free Trade Agreements. It also provides an influential framework for the discussion of the Irish problem between two member states, ourselves and the Irish Republic. Withdrawal, to which Labour is committed would have a highly destructive effect on exports and hence on jobs. We would also lose a great deal of foreign, particularly US investment which has come here because we are in the Community.  The Alliance advocates further development of the Community and new common policies. At the same time however, there is a great deal wrong with the structure of existing policies, and we will take the lead in putting things right.  First, we support political development of the Community through adoption of the common electoral system for the 1984 direct elections to the European Parliament; more majority voting in the Council of Ministers; and greater involvement of the European Parliament in the appointment of the Commission.  Second, to correct the imbalance in existing activities, an Alliance Government will press for expansion of Community activity on regional and social policies, industrial innovation, energy conservation and the development of renewable sources of energy. To develop new policies we accept the need for an increase in community revenues on a more diversified and fairer basis. We will work for some reduction in the agriculture budget first by holding back intervention prices for agricultural products in surplus and if need be by setting a limit on the quantities of production eligible for intervention support.  These are important policies which will help to solve the British budget problem, help solve some of Europe's most chronic difficulties such as the imbalance of wealth and development between regions, and switch the balance of Community activities more directly in line with Britain's needs.  Third, we will take the lead in advocating the development of new policies where Europe has everything to gain from standing together. We must increasingly stand together in trade talks, following the pattern of the recent Multi-Fibre Arrangement talks and GATT talks in which the Commission spoke for the Community. We must increase political co-operation to reach consensus on foreign policy questions and be prepared to move into new areas such as a common procurement policy for defence. We need to develop a Community industrial policy to spend money on easing the pain for areas dependent on declining industries and also in encouraging new, high technology investment. And we need to develop and back initiatives at European level through the Social Fund aimed at reducing youth unemployment from 25 per cent to the level of general unemployment. There is great scope for launching joint economic policies and an Alliance government will take the lead in advocating them. Fourth, an Alliance government will make Britain a full member of the European Monetary System in order to iron out the wild fluctuations in the exchange rate which have done such damage to exports and jobs over the last few years.  Helping the World's Poor  Conservative policy towards the poor countries of the world has been mean and short sighted, reducing the level of British aid and effectively excluding Third World students from our higher education system. The widespread pursuit of restrictive policies has plunged the world into the worst slump for 50 years, and the poor countries have suffered most. On the other hand, Labour's restrictive trade policies would be extremely damaging to the developing world. There is no hope for them or for the rest of the world if protection leads on to waves of retaliation and countries destroy each other's markets, sending the world economy spiralling further downwards.  We want to do two things. First, to advocate joint policies, to be developed and implemented by the major industrial countries, to take the world out of slump. We advocate co-ordinated action:  - a) joint expansionary measures following the example of the 1978 Bonn Economic Summit, so that the main countries expand together, so managing to avoid balance of payments difficulties and the inflationary consequences of collapsing currencies;  - b) monetary stability. Co-operation between the three main currency blocs - the US, Japan and the EMS (including Britain) - to keep their currencies stable;  - c) Additional finance for the developing world so that general expansion is not frustrated by credit constraints - increased resources for the IMF and World Bank, and fresh issues of international money (Special Drawing Rights).  International policies of this kind could chart the way out of recession. In so doing they would help developing countries - and, indeed, the developed countries alike - than any foreseeable increases in levels of aid. However, Britain has a significant individual contribution to make to Third World development through its own aid programme. An Alliance government would:  - increase the proportion of GNP spent on aid over 5 years to 0.7 per cent;  - concentrate aid on the poorest countries and on the poorest people in those countries;  - increase financial support for the work of voluntary agencies, stressing urgent projects;  - promote more generous funding for overseas students, especially those from the poorest countries and the poorest students from other countries;  - support the principles of the Brandt Report, and in particular the proposals for increased credit through the international institutions.  The programme of reform set out in this document rivals in scope and imagination that of the liberal reforming government of 1906-11 or the Attlee administration of 1945-51. It is a formidable challenge to the nation to opt for a decisive change of course to put things right. There is no chance that either of the two old class parties will carry out any of the fundamental reforms - to the system of pay determination, or the structure of industrial relations, or the welfare state or the political system - advocated in this document, all of which are now desperately needed. The Alliance alone provides the opportunity to decide against the failures of the past and offers new hope for the renewal and rejuvenation of our country."
"Conservatives",198306,"FOREWORD - THE CHALLENGE OF OUR TIMES  In the last four years, Britain has recovered her confidence and self-respect. We have regained the regard and admiration of other nations. We are seen today as a people with integrity, resolve and the will to succeed.  This Manifesto describes the achievements of four years of Conservative government and sets out our plans for our second term.  The choice before the nation is stark: either to continue our present steadfast progress towards recovery, or to follow policies more extreme and more damaging than those ever put forward by any previous Opposition.  We face three challenges: the defence of our country, the employment of our people, and the prosperity of our economy.  How to defend Britain's traditional liberties and distinctive way of life is the most vital decision that faces the people at this election.  We have enjoyed peace and security for thirty-eight years - peace with freedom and justice. We dare not put that security at risk.  Every thinking man and woman wants to get rid of nuclear weapons. To do that we must negotiate patiently from a position of strength, not abandon ours in advance.  The universal problem of our time, and the most intractable, is unemployment.  The answer is not bogus social contracts and government overspending. Both, in the end, destroy jobs. The only way to a lasting reduction in unemployment is to make the right products at the right prices, supported by good services. The Government's role is to keep inflation down and offer real incentives for enterprise. As we win back customers, so we win back jobs.  We have a duty to protect the most vulnerable members of our society, many of whom contributed to the heritage we now enjoy. We are proud of the way we have shielded the pensioner and the National Health Service from the recession.  Only if we create wealth can we continue to do justice to the old and the sick and the disabled. It is economic success which will provide the surest guarantee of help for those who need it most.  Our history is the story of a free people - a great chain of people stretching back into the past and forward into the future.  All are linked by a common belief in freedom, and in Britain's greatness. All are aware of their own responsibility to contribute to both.  Our past is witness to their enduring courage, honesty and flair, and to their ability to change and create. Our future will be shaped by those same qualities.  The task we face is formidable. Together, we have achieved much over the past four years. I believe it is now right to ask for a new mandate to meet the challenge of our times.  MARGARET THATCHER  THE ROAD TO RECOVERY  Britain is once more a force to be reckoned with. Formidable difficulties remain to be overcome. But after four years of Conservative government, national recovery has begun.  When we came to office in May 1979, our country was suffering both from an economic crisis and a crisis of morale. British industry was uncompetitive, over-taxed, over-regulated and over-manned. The British economy was plagued by inflation. After only a brief artificial pause, it was back into double figures. This country was drifting further and further behind its neighbours. Defeatism was in the air.  We did not disguise the fact that putting Britain right would be an extremely difficult task. The second sharp oil price increase and the deepest world recession since the 1 930s have made those difficulties worse. At the same time, the Western world is passing through another transformation from the age of the smokestack to the era of the microchip. Traditional industries are being transformed by the new technologies. These changes have led to a rapid rise in unemployment in almost every Western country.  Our opponents claim that they could abolish unemployment by printing or borrowing thousands of millions of pounds. This is a cruel deceit. Their plans would immediately unleash a far more savage economic crisis than their last; a crisis which would, very soon, bring more unemployment in its wake.  The truth is that unemployment, in Britain as in other countries, can be checked and then reduced only by steadily and patiently rebuilding the economy so that it produces the goods and services which people want to buy, at prices they can afford.  WHAT WE HAVE ACHIEVED  This is the task to which we have steadfastly applied ourselves with gradually increasing success. Prices are rising more slowly now than at any time for fifteen years. Britain is now among the low-inflation nations of the Western world. Output is rising.  We are creating the conditions in which trade and industry can prosper. We have swept away controls on wages, prices, dividends, foreign exchange, hire purchase, and office and factory building.  We have returned to free enterprise many state firms, in order to provide better service to the customer and save taxpayers' money.  We have cut income tax rates and raised allowances at all levels.  We have more than protected pensions against rising prices. We have strengthened the National Health Service. We have given council tenants the right to buy their own homes.  We have strengthened the police and the armed forces of the Crown.  We have done all this and more, and still kept our promise to bring public spending under control.  We have paid off nearly half the overseas debts the Labour Party left behind. Once the IMF's biggest borrower, we are now playing a leading part in strengthening international trade and finance - to the benefit of the poorest countries on earth.  And we have acted so that people might live in freedom and justice. The bravery, skill and determination with which Britain's task force recaptured the Falklands reverberated around the world. Many small nations gave thanks for that stand; and our allies in the North Atlantic are heartened by what Britain achieved in the South Atlantic.  Over the past four years, this country has recaptured much of her old pride. We now have five great tasks for the future. They are:  - to create an economy which provides stable prices, lasting prosperity and employment for our people;  - to build a responsible society which protects the weak but also allows the family and the individual to flourish;  - to uphold Parliamentary democracy and strengthen the rule of law;  - to improve the quality of life in our cities and countryside;  - to defend Britain's freedom, to keep faith with our allies in Europe and in NATO, and to keep the peace with justice.  These tasks will require sustained determination, imagination and effort from Government and people alike.  JOBS, PRICES AND UNIONS  During the years of recession, now coming to an end, even the most successful of our competitors have faced increasingly serious problems and mounting unemployment. Despite all these difficulties, the Conservative Government has been overcoming Britain's fundamental problems: restoring sound money, setting a better balance between trade unions and the rest of society, bringing efficiency to the nationalised industries, and developing effective policies to mitigate the curse of unemployment.  The foundations of recovery have been firmly laid. In the next Parliament, we shall build on this progress.  SUCCESS AGAINST INFLATION  Steadier prices and honest money are essential conditions for recovery. Under the last Labour government, prices doubled and inflation soared to an all-time peak - despite the existence of a battery of controls on prices, profits, dividends and pay.  Today, there are no such controls. Yet prices are rising more slowly than at any time since the 1 960s. During the last year, inflation has come down faster in Britain than in any other major economy. With lower inflation, businessmen, families, savers and pensioners can now begin at last to plan and budget ahead with confidence.  In the next Parliament, we shall endeavour to bring inflation lower still. Our ultimate goal should be a society with stable prices.  We shall maintain firm control of public spending and borrowing. If Government borrows too much, interest rates rise, and so do mortgage payments. Less spending by Government leaves more room to reduce taxes on families and businesses.  We shall continue to set out a responsible financial strategy which will gradually reduce the growth of money in circulation - and so go on bringing inflation down.  Our opponents are once again proposing the same financial policies that led to such appalling inflation and chaos in the past.  Labour's 'National Economic Assessment' is a stale repeat of the Social Contract which ended so disastrously in the Winter of Discontent. Once again, the Labour Party is committed to carry out trade union leaders' instructions in exchange for mere expressions of goodwill.  COMMONSENSE IN PAY BARGAINING  With lower inflation. we have seen a return to commonsense in pay bargaining. Uncertainty and anxiety about rising prices have contributed to the absurdly high pay claims that destroyed so many jobs. As inflation subsides, people in work can see the prospect of real, properly-earned improvements in their living standards - which have gone up by more than 5 per cent on average over the last four years. So long as sensible government policies are matched by sensible attitudes in industry and commerce, these living standards can continue to improve.  The last four years have shown that a bureaucratic machine for controlling wages and prices is quite unnecessary. It simply stores up trouble and breeds inefficiency.  But Government remains inescapably responsible for controlling its own costs. We are committed to fair and reasonable levels of pay for those who work in the public services. We shall therefore continue to seek sensible arrangements for determining pay in the Civil Service and the National Health Service, following the Megaw Report and the resolution of the NHS pay dispute.  It is equally our duty to the nation as a whole to prevent any abuse of monopoly power or exploitation of the sick, the weak and the elderly. So we must continue to resist unreasonable pay claims in the public sector.  TRADE UNION REFORMS  In the return to more sensible pay bargaining, the trade unions have an important part to play.  They can be powerful instruments for good or harm, to promote progress or hinder change, to create new jobs or to destroy existing ones. All of us have a vital interest in ensuring that this power is used democratically and responsibly.  Both trade union members and the general public have welcomed the 1980 and 1982 Employment Acts, which restrain secondary picketing, encourage secret ballots, curtail abuse of the closed shop, and restore rights of redress against trade unions responsible for committing unlawful acts.  But some trade union leaders still abuse their power against the wishes of their members and the interests of society. Our 1982 Green Paper, _Democracy in Trade Unions,_ points the way to give union members control over their own unions. We shall given union members the right to:  - hold ballots for the election of governing bodies of trade unions;  - decide periodically whether their unions should have party political funds.  We shall also curb the legal immunity of unions to call strikes without the prior approval of those concerned through a fair and secret ballot.  POLITICAL LEVY  Consultations on the Green Paper have confirmed that there is widespread disquiet about how the right of individual trade union members not to pay the political levy operates in practice, through the system of contracting-out. We intend to invite the TUC to discuss the steps which the trade unions themselves can take to ensure that individual members are freely and effectively able to decide for themselves whether or not to pay the political levy. In the event that the trade unions are not willing to take such steps, the Government will be prepared to introduce measures to guarantee the free and effective right of choice.  ESSENTIAL SERVICES  The proposal to curb immunity in the absence of pre-strike ballots will reduce the risk of strikes in essential services. In addition, we shall consult further about the need for industrial relations in specified essential services to be governed by adequate procedure agreements, breach of which would deprive industrial action of immunity. The nation is entitled to expect that the operation of essential services should not be disrupted.  INVOLVING EMPLOYEES  Good employers involve their employees by consulting them and keeping them fully informed. This is vital for efficiency as well as harmony in industry. We shall continue to encourage it. Many employers have already done much in recent years to establish a long-needed sense of common purpose with their workforces. We shall resist current attempts to impose rigid systems of employer/employee relations in Britain. We will continue to encourage workers to identify with the success of the firm for which they work, by the promotion of share-ownership and profit-sharing.  In each of the last two years, largely as a result of tax changes we have introduced, about a quarter of a million employees have acquired shares in the companies that employ them.  When state industries are offered to the private sector, we have given their employees the chance to buy shares in them, and many have exercised this right.  UNEMPLOYMENT: COPING WITH CHANGE  During the last four years, unemployment in the industrialised countries has risen more sharply than at any time since the 1 930s. Britain has been no exception. We have long been one of the least efficient and most over-manned of industrialised nations. We raised our own pay far more, and our output far less, than most of our competitors. Inevitably, this pushed prices up and drove countless customers to buy from other countries, forcing thousands of employers out of business and hundreds of thousands of workers out of jobs.  At the same time, there has been a rapid shift of jobs from the old industries to the new, concentrated on services and the new technologies. Tragically, trade unions have often obstructed these changes. All too often this has delayed and reduced the new and better-paid jobs which could replace those that have been lost.  This Government has an impressive record in helping the unemployed who, usually through no fault of their own, are paying the price of these past errors.  We have committed over £2,000m. this year to training and special measures for the unemployed. This is supported by substantial help from the European Community's Social Fund, amounting to over £250m. in 1982. As long as unemployment remains high, we shall maintain special measures of this kind, which bring effective help to many of those who have no job.  This year, some 1,100,000 people are being trained or helped by the most comprehensive programme of its kind in Europe.  For the first time, the new Enterprise Allowance Scheme offers many thousands of unemployed people the support they need, but previously could not get, while they start their own businesses. We will maintain special help for the long-term unemployed through the Community Programme, and for the older unemployed through early retirement schemes.  REMOVING THE BARRIERS TO JOBS  We shall go on reducing the barriers which discourage employers from recruiting more staff, even when they want to. And we shall help to make the job market more flexible and efficient so that more people can work part-time if they wish, and find work more easily.  That is why we have amended the Employment Protection Act and why we shall continue to:  - minimise the legal restrictions which discourage the creation of new jobs;  - encourage moves towards greater flexibility in working practices, such as Part-Time Job Release, which makes it financially possible for people nearing retirement age to go part-time; and the Job-Splitting Scheme which helps employers to split a whole-time job into two part-time jobs;  - improve the efficiency of the employment services in identifying and filling job vacancies;  - ensure that Wages Councils do not reduce job opportunities by forcing workers to charge unrealistic pay rates, or employers to offer them.  TRAINING  If we are to make the most of the employment opportunities that present themselves in an age of rapid change and more varied patterns of work and occupation, up-to-date training is essential.  Training for work must start with better, more relevant education at school. For school leavers, we have provided the most imaginative and far-reaching scheme in our history. The Youth Training Scheme offers every 16-year old a year of serious training for work. It should help 350,000 youngsters by the autumn of this year. From now on, no one leaving school at 16 need be unemployed in his first year out of school.  This is only a part of our wider strategy to ensure effective training for the skills and jobs of tomorrow - on a scale and of a quality to match the world's best. At its heart is our reform of industrial training and the apprenticeship system.  We are improving the scope and quality of our training for the employed and unemployed alike; tackling problems which the Labour Party has never had the courage to face.  We shall continue to provide for, and improve, the special employment and training needs of the disabled, and to reform our training agencies to meet more effectively the needs of industry and workers alike.  THE NATIONALISED INDUSTRIES  Reform of the nationalised industries is central to economic recovery. Most people who work in these industries work hard and have a sense of public service. Since 1979, we have gone to great lengths to improve the performance of the state sector, to appoint top-class managers and work closely with them to tackle each industry's problems.  But for all this, few people can now believe that state ownership means better service to the customer. The old illusions have melted away. Nationalisation does not improve job satisfaction, job security or labour relations - almost all the serious strikes in recent years have been in state industries and services. We have also seen how the burden of financing the state industries has kept taxes and government borrowing higher than they need have been.  A company which has to satisfy its customers and compete to survive is more likely to be efficient, alert to innovation, and genuinely accountable to the public. That is why we have transferred to private ownership, in whole or in part, Cable and Wireless, Associated British Ports, British Aerospace, Britoil, British Rail Hotels, Amersham International, and the National Freight Corporation. Many of their shares have been bought by their own employees and managers, which is the truest public ownership of all.  We shall continue our programme to expose state-owned firms to real competition. In telecommunications, we have licensed a new independent network, Mercury, and have decided to license two mobile telephone networks. We have allowed competition in commercial postal services. Already, standards of service are beginning to improve. Investment is rising. And better job opportunities are being opened up.  We shall transfer more state-owned businesses to independent ownership. Our aim is that British Telecom - where we will sell 51 per cent of the shares to the private sector Rolls Royce, British Airways and substantial parts of British Steel, of British Shipbuilders and of British Leyland, and as many as possible of Britain's airports, shall become private sector companies. We also aim to introduce substantial private capital into the National Bus Company. As before, we will offer shares to all those who work in them.  We shall also transfer to the private sector the remaining state-owned oil business - the British Gas Corporation's offshore oil interests.  We have abolished the Gas Corporation's statutory monopoly of the supply of North Sea gas to industry. Already there has been a vigorous new lease of life for gas exploration and development in the North Sea, which had ground to a complete halt under Labour. In the last Parliament, we passed a law to encourage the private generation of electricity. In the next Parliament, we shall seek other means of increasing competition in, and attracting private capital into, the gas and electricity industries.  Merely to replace state monopolies by private ones would be to waste an historic opportunity. So we will take steps to ensure that these new firms do not exploit their powerful positions to the detriment of consumers or their competitors. Those nationalised industries which cannot be privatised or organised as smaller and more efficient units will be given top-quality management and required to work to clear guidelines.  ENCOURAGING FREE ENTERPRISE  We want to see an economy in which firms, large and small, have every incentive to expand by winning extra business and creating more jobs. This Conservative Government has been both giving those incentives and clearing away the obstacles to expansion: the high rates of tax on individuals and businesses; the difficulties facing the small firm trying to grow, and the self-employed man trying to set up on his own; the blockages in the planning system; the bottlenecks on our roads; the restrictions on our farmers and fishermen; and the resistance to new ideas and technologies.  In the last four years, many British firms have made splendid progress in improving their competitiveness and profitability. But there is some way to go yet before this country has regained that self-renewing capacity for growth which once made her a great economic power, and will make her great again.  Only a government which really works to promote free enterprise can provide the right conditions for that dream to come true.  LOWER AND SIMPLER TAXES  In the last four years, we have made great strides in reducing and simplifying taxes. We have:  - cut the basic rate of income tax; raised tax allowances above the level we inherited _after_ allowing for price rises; brought the higher rates of income tax down to European levels; and made big reductions in the investment income surcharge, which have particularly helped the old;  - removed many of the worst features of Capital Transfer Tax, Capital Gains Tax and Development Land Tax;  - cut business taxes, in particular the National Insurance Surcharge, Labour's tax on jobs, from 3½ per cent to 1 per cent; and improved stock relief for businesses;  - much reduced the taxes on, and increased the incentives for, gifts to charities;  - greatly reduced tax bureaucracy. Manpower in the Inland Revenue and Customs & Excise has fallen from 113,400 in April 1979 to 98,500 in April 1983, and is set to fall further.  This dramatic progress is all the more striking when compared with the vast increases in taxation which our opponents' policies would inevitably bring.  The changes to this year's Finance Act on which Labour have insisted show that they intend just this. We shall reverse those changes at the earliest opportunity.  Further improvements in allowances and lower rates of income tax remain a high priority, together with measures to reduce the poverty and unemployment traps.  We want to encourage wider ownership. This means lowering taxes on capital and savings; encouraging individuals to invest directly in company shares; and encouraging the creation of more employee share schemes.  MORE SMALL FIRMS  We have reduced the burdens on small firms, especially in employment legislation and planning, and cut many of the taxes they pay, particularly Corporation Tax. Our Loan Guarantee Scheme has already backed extra lending of over £300m. to about 10,000 small firms. The new Business Expansion Scheme, a major extension of the Business Start-up Scheme, will encourage outside investment in small companies by special tax reliefs. The construction of new premises for small businesses has more than doubled.  To help the engineering industry and the areas most dependent on it, we have introduced and now extended a very successful scheme of grants (SEFIS) to smaller firms, which help them to buy new machinery.  Thanks to these policies and over one hundred other important measures, the climate for new and smaller businesses in the UK has been transformed and is now as favourable as anywhere in the world.  HELP FOR THE NEW TECHNOLOGIES  Even during the recession, our new industries and technologies made remarkable progress. Britain has more micro-computers in relation to its population than any other country. We have speeded this progress by supporting research and spreading knowledge of the technologies of tomorrow; and by increasing government support for the new technologies from £100m. in 1978-9 to over £350m. in 1983-4. But that is only the beginning. We will now:  - promote, in partnership with industry, the Alvey programme for research into advanced information technology;  - accelerate the transfer of technology from the university laboratory to the market place, especially by the encouragement of science parks;  - help firms to launch new products through pilot schemes and public purchasing;  - build on the successes of our 'Micros-in-Schools' scheme and our network of Information Technology Centres for the young unemployed so that they are equipped with tomorrow's skills;  - sanction the launch of new cable networks to bring wider choice to consumers, not just for entertainment, but for the whole new world of tele-shopping and tele-banking.  REGIONS, ENTERPRISE ZONES AND FREEPORTS  We shall continue to maintain an effective regional policy which is essential to ease the process of change and encourage new businesses in areas which have been dependent on declining industries. We do not propose sudden changes in regional policy. But we will:  - make sure that these policies are economical and effective in creating genuine jobs;  - secure more effective co-ordination between central and local government and the European Community's Regional Development Fund to ensure that their actions offer the greatest help to communities in need;  - further develop local self-help initiatives, the 24 Enterprise Zones and, our latest innovation, duty-free trading zones, which will be established in certain experimental 'Freeports';  - diversify regional economies by encouraging the fullest use of our schemes for innovation.  PLANNING  In our crowded country the planning system has to strike a delicate balance. It must provide for the homes and workplaces we need. It must protect the environment in which we live.  One particular way to achieve this is by bringing back into use the thousands of acres lying derelict and unused, so much of which is in the ownership of local authorities or other public bodies. We have set up Land Registers to identify this land, and we shall now use our powers to bring it into use. The more this land can be used, the less the need to build on Green Belts and the countryside. We will also bring open-cast coalmining within normal proper planning control, and we shall establish more control over intensive livestock units near residential areas.  ENERGY  Britain has come from nowhere to be the world's fifth largest oil producer. The North Sea success story has been a triumph of private enterprise for the nation's benefit. We shall continue to ensure that our taxation and licensing policies encourage development in the North Sea.  In the next Parliament, the interests of the whole country require Britain's massive coal industry, on which we depend for the overwhelming bulk of our electricity generation, to return to economic viability.  We shall press ahead with the development of safe nuclear power. It is an important way of securing lower-cost electricity for the future. We shall set up an Energy Efficiency Office to co-ordinate the Government's conservation effort, so as to ensure that the taxpayer gets the best value for money.  We recognise that some energy users have special needs. This is why we have:  - ensured that standing charges no longer dominate the bills of small gas and electricity consumers;  - increased help for the needy with their fuel bills, leading to many fewer disconnections;  and  - introduced more favourable terms for the energy-intensive industries.  BETTER TRANSPORT FOR INDUSTRY  The national motorway and trunk road network will continue to be developed and improved to high-quality standards. This will not only make driving much safer for all, but also speed and cheapen the transport of goods. We will also seek to make rail freight more competitive.  Many of our ports have now been returned from state control to independent ownership. We intend that they should provide profitable and efficient services without the taxpayers' support.  TOURISM  Our hotels, resorts and tourist attractions are important because they provide hundreds of thousands of jobs, earn valuable foreign exchange, and provide holidays for millions of our own people. We shall continue to support the Tourist Boards and tourism projects throughout the country.  FARMING AND FISHING  British farming and horticulture have improved dramatically since 1979. Exports have leapt to £2,500m. a year. Since 1978, our self-sufficiency in food has risen by more than a sixth, from 53 per cent to 62 per cent.  In Europe, our tough negotiating stance has doubled our farmers' share of the help available under the Common Agricultural Policy. The cost of the CAP to British taxpayers doubled under Labour. Under us, it has been falling in real terms. We have reversed the Labour Government's disastrous policy for the Green Pound which harmed British farmers. At the same time, we have not neglected the consumers' interest. Food prices more than doubled under Labour and rose faster than other prices. Under the Conservatives, they have risen less than other prices. Last year they grew by less than one per cent, the smallest rise for nearly twenty years.  We have given special help to Britain's hill farmers, and agreed very worthwhile Community schemes for beef and sheepmeat. These have all brought great benefits to Wales, Scotland, Northern Ireland and the uplands of England. We have launched successfully the 'Food from Britain' campaign, which should help us sell far more of our products both at home and in the rest of the Community.  We shall help the glasshouse industry to sell more fruit and vegetables, and to make use of the best possible arrangements for heating and insulation.  We welcome the fact that, after long negotiations, the National Farmers' Union and the Country Landowners' Association have agreed on the best way to make more farm tenancies available for young people. We shall legislate on these lines at an early opportunity. We intend to make sure that British agriculture and horticulture continue to make the greatest possible contribution to our economic success.  We have successfully negotiated a Common Fishing Agreement that provides British fishermen with the greatest advantages in our waters in the industry's history. For the first time since we joined the Community, we now have effective conservation measures, and can look forward to expanding, rather than declining, stocks of fish. During the next Parliament, we shall introduce measures to restructure the fishing industry and to encourage investment and better marketing.  RESPONSIBILITY AND THE FAMILY  Freedom and responsibility go together. The Conservative Party believes in encouraging people to take responsibility for their own decisions. We shall continue to return more choice to individuals and their families. That is the way to increase personal freedom. It is also the way to improve standards in the state services.  Conservatives believe equally strongly in the duty of Government to help those who are least able to help themselves. We have more than carried out our pledges to protect pensioners against price rises and to maintain standards in the National Health Service. This rebuts the totally unfounded charge that we want to 'dismantle the Welfare State'. We are determined that our public services should provide the best possible value both for people they seek to help and for the taxpayer who pays the bill.  A free and independent society is one in which the ownership of property is spread as widely as possible. A business which is partly or wholly owned by its workers will have more pride in performance. Already firms like the National Freight Company, where managers and workers joined together to take over the business, are thriving.  Under this Government, the property-owning democracy is growing fast. And the basic foundation of it is the family home.  HOUSING: TOWARDS A HOME-OWNING DEMOCRACY  We have given every council and New Town tenant the legal right to buy his or her own home. Many Housing Association tenants have been granted the same right, too. This is the biggest single step towards a home-owning democracy ever taken. It is also the largest transfer of property from the State to the individual. No less than half a million council houses and flats were sold in the last Parliament to the people who live in them. By our encouragement of private housebuilding and our new range of schemes to help first-time buyers, there are a million more owner-occupiers today than four years ago.  The Labour Party has met these proposals with vicious and prolonged resistance and is still fighting a rearguard action against wider home ownership. A Labour government would take away the tenant's right to buy his council house, would prevent councils selling even voluntarily at a discount, and would force any former tenant who wanted to sell his house to sell it back to the council.  In the next Parliament, we will give many thousand more families the chance to buy their homes. For public sector tenants, the present 'Right to Buy' scheme will be improved and extended to include the right to buy houses on leasehold land and the right to buy on a shared ownership basis. The maximum discount will be increased by one per cent a year for those who have been tenants for between twenty and thirty years, taking the maximum discount to 60 per cent. We shall also help first-time buyers who are not council tenants through our various low-cost home-ownership schemes: 'homesteading', building for sale, improvement for sale, and shared ownership.  Britain needs more homes to rent, too, in the private sector as well as the public sector. For years, the blind prejudice of the Labour Party has cast a political blight on privately rented housing. But our assured tenancy scheme has encouraged builders to start building new homes to rent again, and our shorthold scheme is helping the private sector to meet the needs of those who want short-term rented accommodation.  We shall extend our Tenants' Charter to enable council tenants to get necessary repairs done themselves and be reimbursed by their councils. Housing Improvement Grants have been increased substantially in the last two years and will continue to play an important role.  We shall conduct early public consultation of proposals which would enable the building societies to play a fuller part in supporting the provision of new housing and would bring up to date the laws which govern them.  Our goal is to make Britain the best housed nation in Europe.  PROTECTING THE PENSIONER  Over the last four years, the retirement pension has risen from £19.50 to £32.85 a week for a single person and from £31.20 to £52.55 for a married couple. Even after allowing for price rises, pensioners can buy more with their pension today than they could under the last Labour government. We have ended Labour's unreliable system of relying on forecasts of price rises to decide by how much to increase the pension. In five of the last seven years, those forecasts turned out to be wrong. In future, pensions will be related to actual and not estimated price increases.  In the next Parliament, we shall continue to protect retirement pensions and other linked long-term benefits against rising prices. Public sector pensioners will also continue to be protected on the basis of realistic pension contributions. In this Parliament, we raised to £57 a week the amount pensioners may earn without losing any of their pension. It remains our intention to continue raising the limit and to abolish this earnings rule as soon as we can. The Christmas Bonus, which Labour failed to pay in 1975 and 1976, will continue to be paid every year in accordance with the law we passed in 1979.  Over 11.5m. people - half the working population - are now covered by occupational pension schemes. We will consider how the pension rights of 'early leavers', people who change jobs, can be better protected and how their members may be given fuller information about their pension schemes.  SOCIAL SECURITY  Supplementary benefits, too, have been raised ahead of prices. To encourage thrift, instead of penalising it, the Government has also raised the amount of savings people can keep without losing any supplementary benefit. At the same time, we have clamped down firmly on fraud and abuse of social security.  Expenditure on cash benefits to the disabled is 21 per cent higher than under Labour, even after allowing for rising prices. There has been extra help, too, for those who are least able to afford their fuel bills.  We have introduced - and extended - a widows' bereavement allowance. We have kept the war widows' pension ahead of prices and removed it from tax altogether.  Child benefit and one-parent benefit are to be raised in November to their highest-ever level in real terms. We have also improved the family income supplement scheme to help low-paid working families.  Our record shows the strength of our commitment. But our ability to help depends on the wealth which the country produces. In Britain today, over 40p in every pound of public spending is already devoted to health and social security. It is hypocritical for the Labour party to pretend that they could raise public spending on benefits by thousands of millions of pounds without admitting the vast increases in taxation and national insurance contributions that would be needed, or the increased inflation that would result.  THE NATIONAL HEALTH SERVICE  We have more than matched our pledge to maintain spending on the National Health Service and secure proper value for money. Even after allowing for price rises, the nation is spending substantially more on health, and getting better health care.  By last year, there were 45,000 more nurses and midwives, and over 6,500 more doctors and dentists, working for the NHS than in 1978. This has helped to make it possible to treat over two million more patients a year in our hospitals. Until last year's futile strike, waiting lists for treatment fell sharply.  We intend to continue to make sure that all patients receive the best possible value for the money that is spent on the Health Service. The treatment of the elderly, the mentally handicapped and the mentally ill will continue to make extra provision for those parts of the country in the North and the Midlands which have always been comparatively short of resources.  Unlike the last Labour government which actually cut the hospital building programme by one-third, we have committed £1,100m. to our large-scale programme for building new hospitals. There are now 140 new hospitals in that programme being designed or built. We shall continue to upgrade existing hospitals and brighten up shabby wards.  To release more money for looking after patients, we will reduce the costs of administering the Health Service. We are asking health authorities to make the maximum possible savings by putting services like laundry, catering and hospital cleaning out to  competitive tender. We are tightening up, too, on management costs, and getting much firmer control of staff numbers.  Most people who are ill or frail would prefer to stay in or near their own homes, rather than live in a hospital or institution. Helping people to stay in familiar surroundings is the aim of our policy 'Care in the Community'. The Government has given extra powers and extra cash to health authorities to enable them to finance such community care for individual patients on a long-term basis.  PARTNERSHIP IN CARE  Conservatives reject Labour's contention that the State can and should do everything.  We welcome the growth in private health insurance in recent years. This has both made more health care available, and lightened the load on the NHS, particularly for non-urgent operations. We shall continue to encourage this valuable supplement to state care. We shall promote closer partnership between the State and the private sectors in the exchange of facilities and of ideas in the interests of all patients.  We also welcome the vital contribution made by voluntary organisations in the social services. We shall continue to give them strong support. The Conservative Government has already made many radical changes in law and taxation which have greatly improved the way charities and voluntary bodies are financed. The terms governing gifts under covenants have been much improved, and the liability to capital taxation has been lightened or swept away.  We shall continue to support our highly successful 'Opportunities for Volunteering' scheme. In the next Parliament, we shall develop other new ways to encourage more private giving.  SCHOOLS: THE PURSUIT OF EXCELLENCE  For a long time now, parents have been worried about standards and discipline in many of our schools. This Conservative Government has responded to that worry with the Parents' Charter and the 1980 Education Act. For the first time:  - local authorities were obliged to take account of parents' choice of school for their children;  - schools were obliged to publish prospectuses, giving details of their examination results;  - parents were given the right to be represented on school governing bodies;  - the Government offered Assisted Places to enable less well-off parents to send bright children to some of the best independent schools.  Giving parents more power is one of the most effective ways of raising educational standards. We shall continue to seek ways of widening parental choice and influence over their children's schooling.  We shall defend Church schools and independent schools alike against our opponents' attacks. And we shall defend the right of parents to spend their own money on educating their children.  This country is now spending more per child in school than ever before, even after allowing for price rises. As a result, the average number of children per teacher is the lowest ever. Exactly how the money is spent, and how schools are run, is up to local education authorities.  But the Government can help improve standards and make sure that children are taught and trained for the world they will grow up into.  - Until now, HM Inspectors' reports have remained secret. Now we are publishing them and making sure they are followed up, too.  - We are not satisfied with the selection or the training of our teachers. Our White Paper sets out an important programme for improving teacher training colleges.  - We shall switch the emphasis in the Education Welfare Service back to school attendance, so as to reduce truancy.  - We have given special help for refresher courses for teachers, research into special schools, and play groups and nursery schools where they are most needed.  - We shall also encourage schools to keep proper records of their pupils' achievements, buy more computers, and carry out external graded tests. The public examination system will be improved, and O-level standards will be maintained.  - We are setting up fourteen pilot projects to bring better technical education to teenagers. The success of these will play a vital part in raising technical training in Britain to the level of our best overseas competitors.  HIGHER EDUCATION  Our universities and polytechnics, too, must generate new ideas and train the skilled workforce of the next generation. We have unrivalled institutions and unrivalled inventive genius - as the number of British Nobel prize-winners shows. What matters is to bring the two closer together and make the best practical use of both.  Britain has more students in professional training than Japan, and a greater proportion of young people in higher education than France or West Germany. More of our young people are now entering full-time degree courses than under the last Labour government. And a larger proportion of them complete their courses than in most other countries.  The very large sums of public money now going to higher education must be spent in the most effective way. Within that budget, we want to see a shift towards technological, scientific and engineering courses.  - We have set aside money for 700 new posts for young lecturers over three years to bring new blood into research.  - Over the next three years, we will provide for more teaching and research on information technology, with new posts for lecturers, and 2,200 new places for students.  SPORT AND RECREATION  The Government has increased the real level of funding for the Sports Council. The Urban Aid and Derelict Land Programmes have also contributed to new sporting projects. By these means, and by offering one pound of government money for every one pound raised locally, we have begun to transform sports facilities in the inner cities.But there are still plenty of sports facilities which could be opened up to the general public. In particular, to reinforce our initiatives for better use of schools and playing fields, we shall urge every local education authority to make school and college premises available for use outside school hours and in the holidays. In all these initiatives, voluntary bodies will be enabled to play a bigger part.  We have kept up the pressure for public access to parks and reservoirs for anglers and all those who enjoy and respect the countryside.  SAFETY. QUALITY AND VALUE FOR MONEY  The best way to protect the consumer is to bring price rises down and keep them down, and to increase competition. We have achieved both, and so helped the housewife far more than any bureaucratic system of controls. We have also brought the state industries under the scrutiny of the Monopolies and Mergers Commission, and exposed many of them to competition to prevent them from exploiting their customers.  We shall remain vigilant in defence of the quality and safety of the products people buy. But we shall also reduce government intervention wherever it is unnecessary or harmful to the interests of the customer.  The provisions of our Data Protection Bill will meet public concern that computers pose a particular threat to privacy, and will enable us to ratify the European Convention on Data Protection.  SUPPORTING FAMILY LIFE  It is not for the Government to try to dictate how men and women should organise their lives. Our approach is to help people and their families fulfil their own aspirations in a rapidly changing world. As an employer, this Government is fulfilling its commitment to equal opportunities for men and women who work in the public services. We have brought forward for public discussion proposals for improving the tax treatment of married women, whether or not they go out to work.  We are reviewing the family jurisdiction of the courts, including their conciliation role, with a view to improving the administration of family law. We shall also reform the divorce laws to offer further protection to children, and to secure fairer financial arrangements when a marriage ends.  LAW, DEMOCRACY AND THE CITIZEN  The rule of law matters deeply to every one of us. Any concession to the thief, the thug or the terrorist undermines that principle which is the foundation of all our liberties. That is why we have remained firm in the face of the threats of hijackers and hunger strikers alike. The defeat of the occupation of the Iranian Embassy is only one example of our determination to be patient but still unyielding.  BACKING THE CRIME-FIGHTERS  We recognised from the start the immense and continuing public concern about lawlessness, particularly in some of our larger cities. We acted immediately to fulfil our pledges to give the hard-pressed police every possible backing.  - The strength of the police force now stands at record levels: 9,000 extra policemen have been recruited in England and Wales alone since 1979. They are much better paid and equipped than ever before. We shall be ready to increase police establishments where necessary in the war against crime.  - Thousands more policemen are back on the beat, where the public wishes to see them, instead of being isolated in panda cars. It takes time for any reform in police training and methods to achieve its full effect, but already street crime is being reduced and public confidence improved in some of the worst inner-city areas.  - The proposals embodied in our Police and Criminal Evidence Bill will help the police to bring criminals to justice. At the same time, they will reinforce public support for the police by laying down clear rules for the proper treatment of suspects. We shall also build more courtrooms to reduce delays in trying criminal cases.  - Last year's Criminal Justice Act has given the courts tougher and more flexible sentencing powers. This Act makes parents more responsible for crimes committed by their children, and improves compensation for the victims of crime.  - Courts will also continue to impose Community Service Orders which compel offenders to make amends by doing useful work for the local community. We shall set up more compulsory attendance centres to which the courts can send young hooligans. The invaluable work of the Probation Service will continue to be supported.  - There must be enough prison places to cope with sentences imposed by the courts. We shall complete our major programme of building which will provide another 4,800 places in ten new prisons. And we are recruiting more prison officers to staff them.  - We will also respond to the increasing public concern over obscenity and offences against public decency, which often have links with serious crime. We propose to introduce specific legislation to deal with the most serious of these problems, such as the dangerous spread of violent and obscene video cassettes.  - We accept the case for an independent prosecution service, and will consider how it might best be set up.  - We intend to extend substantially the grounds that disqualify those with criminal records from serving on juries.  Dealing with crimes, civil disobedience, violent demonstrations and pornography are not matters for the police alone. It is teachers and parents - and television producers, too - who influence the moral standards of the next generation. There must be close co-operation and understanding between the police and the community they serve.  IMMIGRATION: FIRM AND FAIR  We are utterly opposed to racial discrimination wherever it occurs, and we are determined to see that there is real equality of opportunity. The Conservative Party is, and always has been, strongly opposed to unfairness, harassment and persecution, whether it be inspired by racial, religious or ideological motives.  To have good community relations, we have to maintain effective immigration control. Since 1979, immigration for settlement has dropped sharply to the lowest level since control of immigration from the Commonwealth began more than twenty years ago. By passing the British Nationality Act, we have created a secure system of rights and a sound basis for control in the future; and we will continue to pursue policies which are strict but fair.  THE SUPREMACY OF PARLIAMENT  The British Constitution has outlasted most of the alternatives which have been offered as replacements. It is because we stand firm for the supremacy of Parliament that we are determined to keep its rules and procedures in good repair.  We have modernised the Select Committees to improve Parliament's ability to keep a check on the actions of the Executive. We shall continue to pursue sensible, carefully considered reforms where they are of practical value.  Labour want to abolish the House of Lords. We will ensure that it has a secure and effective future. A strong Second Chamber is a vital safeguard for democracy and contributes to good government.  NORTHERN IRELAND  In Northern Ireland, building upon the courage, commitment and increasing success of our security forces, we will give the highest priority to upholding law and order. We will continue to give the support essential for the Province to overcome its economic difficulties.  The people of Northern Ireland will continue to be offered a framework for participation in local democracy and political progress through the Assembly. There will be no change in Northern Ireland's constitutional position in the United Kingdom without the consent of the majority of people there, and no devolution of powers without widespread support throughout the community. We believe that a close practical working relationship between the United Kingdom and the Government of the Republic can contribute to peace and stability in Northern Ireland without threatening in any way the position of the majority community in the Province.  THE QUALITY OF GOVERNMENT  This country is fortunate to have a Civil Service with high standards of administration and integrity. The Civil Service has loyally and effectively helped to carry through the far-reaching changes we have made to secure greater economy, efficiency and better management in Government itself. It is a tribute to this spirit of co-operation that the number of civil servants has been reduced from 732,000 to 649,000 with the minimum of redundancies and with higher standards of service to the citizen. This has saved the taxpayer about £500m. a year, and is helping us to improve civil service working conditions.  The efficiency 'scrutinies' launched by Lord Rayner and other money-saving techniques have now identified savings worth £400m. a year to the taxpayer. We have abolished 500 Quangos and done away with no less than 3,600 different types of government forms.  We are successfully putting out to tender more services needed by central government. We shall press on with this wherever public money can be saved and standards of service maintained or improved.  Public spending is now planned in terms of hard cash instead of so-called constant prices, and the discipline of cash limits on spending has been extended. As a result, public spending is firmly under control.  LOCAL GOVERNMENT: SAVING RATEPAYERS' MONEY  We have checked the relentless growth of local government spending, and manpower is now back down to the level of 1974. The achievement of many Conservative authorities in saving ratepayers' money by putting services like refuse collection out to tender has played a major part in getting better value for money and significantly reducing the level of rate increases. We shall encourage every possible saving by this policy.  There are, however, a number of grossly extravagant Labour authorities whose exorbitant rate demands have caused great distress both to businesses and domestic ratepayers. We shall legislate to curb excessive and irresponsible rate increases by high-spending councils, and to provide a general scheme for limitation of rate increases for all local authorities to be used if necessary.  In addition, for industry we will require local authorities to consult local representatives of industry and commerce before setting their rates. We shall give more businesses the right to pay by instalments. And we shall stop the rating of empty industrial property.  The Metropolitan Councils and the Greater London Council have been shown to be a wasteful and unnecessary tier of government. We shall abolish them and return most of their functions to the boroughs and districts. Services which need to be administered over a wider area - such as police and fire, and education in inner London - will be run by joint boards of borough or district representatives.  IMPROVING OUR ENVIRONMENT  The Conservative Party has a long record of practical and effective action to improve the quality of life in our cities and countryside and to preserve our heritage. Since 1979, no government in Western Europe has done more for the environment - a clumsy word for many of the things that make life worth living.  REVIVING BRITAIN'S CITIES  We have to cure the disastrous mistakes of decades of town-hall Socialism by striking a better balance between public and private effort. Our approach to reviving the rundown areas of our great cities is to use limited public money to stimulate much larger investment by private enterprise. The £60m. we have earmarked for the Urban Development Grant this year will be matched by up to four times that sum from private firms investing in new developments. On Merseyside, Operation Groundwork has brought together landowners, local industry and local authorities to tackle the squalor and dereliction on the edge of towns. The lessons of this and many other Merseyside initiatives will now be applied in other urban areas.  We have encouraged people to move back into the inner cities. Builders are now being helped to build homes of the type that young couples in particular can afford. We shall promote this revival of our inner cities, both by new building, and by sales by local councils of some of their rundown property to homesteaders who will restore the homes themselves.  We shall encourage greater opportunity for all those who live in our inner cities, including our ethnic minorities.  - Our small business schemes are helping to bring firms back into the city centres, and the Enterprise Zones we have set up are already bringing new life to some of the hardest-hit places in industrial Britain.  - We shall continue to give priority to the areas most in need. Our programme for the reclamation of derelict land will continue. We shall increase our efforts to secure the disposal of under-used public sector land, using the powers available to us in order to require sites to be sold for homes and jobs.  PUBLIC TRANSPORT  We have already taken important steps to improve the standards of public transport. We have lifted restrictions on long-distance coach services. As a result, about one hundred new express coach services have been started, fares have been substantially reduced and comfort improved. We shall further relax bus licensing to permit a wider variety of services. We shall encourage the creation of smaller units in place of the monolithic public transport organisations which we have inherited from the Socialist past, and encourage more flexible forms of public transport. City buses and underground railways will still need reasonable levels of subsidy. But greater efficiency and more private enterprise will help keep costs down.  The GLC has grossly mismanaged London Transport. We shall set up a new London Regional Transport Authority for the underground, buses and commuter trains in the London area. This will provide the opportunity to split the different types of transport into separate operating bodies, put more services out to private tender and offer the passenger better performance.  In the country, we shall ensure better use of school and special buses for local communities. Restrictions on minibuses will be cut. So will the red tape which makes it so difficult for small firms and voluntary bodies to provide better ways to get around for those without cars, particularly the very old and the disabled.  We want to see a high-quality, efficient railway service. That does not mean simply providing ever-larger subsidies from the taxpayer. Nor, on the other hand, does it mean embarking upon a programme of major route closures. There is, however, scope for substantial cost reductions in British Rail which are needed to justify investment in a modern and efficient railway.  Fewer restrictive practices and much more attention to the customer are also essential. Rail services are now facing vigorous competition from coaches and cars, and they need to respond with more innovative and more modern work methods. We shall examine ways of decentralising BR and bringing in private enterprise to serve railway customers.  To make life more agreeable in our towns and villages, we will push ahead our bypass programme, which will help to take more lorries away from them.  RURAL POLICY AND ANIMAL WELFARE  Conservatives understand the need for a proper balance between the strengthening of the rural economy and the preservation of the beauty and habitat of our countryside.  Economic development will be encouraged in areas where this balance can be best maintained. At the same time, we have introduced the Wildlife and Countryside Act - the most important piece of legislation yet affecting the countryside - to safeguard areas of natural beauty and sites of scientific interest.  We have taken the lead in the much acclaimed measures to save the whale from extinction and to protect seals, and we shall co-operate fully in the important international work to protect all endangered species.  Since 1979, we have been working to achieve full European agreement on the treatment of animals. We have introduced measures to improve the conditions of farm animals being transported or exported. There is now a European Convention on the Protection of Animals. We welcomed this agreement, and immediately introduced a White Paper on Animal Welfare to foreshadow changes in the law. We now propose to introduce legislation to update the Cruelty to Animals Act 1876 which will ensure more humane treatment of laboratory animals in scientific and industrial research. The sale of pet animals in street markets has been banned.  CONTROLLING POLLUTION  We intend to remove lead from petrol, and are taking the initiative with our European partners to achieve this at the earliest possible date. We will press ahead with our plans to reduce lead in paints, food and drinking water.  We will continue our policy to reduce river pollution - the length of polluted rivers has been halved in the last ten years, and this work will continue. We shall tighten up the controls on the disposal of hazardous waste and continue to support the movement for recycling and reclamation.  The worst problems of air pollution have been resolved. But in some areas the levels of smoke and sulphur dioxide need to be further reduced.  The peaceful application of nuclear energy, if properly controlled (as it always has been in this country), will be beneficial to the environment as well as to the economy. We intend to make sure that the safety record of the British nuclear industry continues to be second to none. The Sizewell Inquiry into Britain's first Pressurised Water Reactor is well under way. The project will go ahead only if both the independent inspector and the Government are satisfied it is safe.  ARTS AND THE HERITAGE  Despite the recession, this Government has strengthened its support for the best of our heritage and for the performing arts. We have created the National Heritage Memorial Fund, which fulfils the long-delayed wish to commemorate the dead of two world wars in a permanent and tangible way. We are building a new British Library. The new Commission for Ancient Monuments and Historic Buildings will both safeguard our heritage and give more people a chance to enjoy it. Under the Conservatives, Britain's opera, theatre and ballet continue to win world-wide renown. And our tax changes have helped to revive the British film industry. We shall keep up the level of government support, including a fair share for the regions. We shall also examine ways of using the tax system to encourage further growth in private support for the arts and the heritage.  BRITAIN IN THE WORLD  For nearly four decades, Europe has been at peace. The strength of the Western Alliance has kept our own freedoms secure. The possession of nuclear weapons by both sides has been an effective deterrent to another war in Europe.  The policies which our Labour opponents now propose would put at risk all this hard-won security.  THE PROTECTION OF PEACE  The invasion of Afghanistan and the suppression of dissent in Poland remind us of the true nature of the Soviet Union. It remains a threat to the liberty and security of the West. The Soviet Union maintains massive armed forces in Europe, and is extending its naval power throughout the world. Soviet nuclear strength continues to grow, despite the false assurances of their propaganda machine.  Labour's support for gestures of one-sided disarmament is reckless and naive. There is no shred of evidence to suggest that the Soviet bloc would follow such an example.  Labour would give up Britain's nuclear deterrent and prevent the United States from using its bases in Britain which are part of its nuclear shield over Europe. That would shatter the NATO Alliance, and put our safety in the greatest jeopardy.  We will fully support the negotiations to reduce the deployment of nuclear weapons. But we will not gamble with our defence.  The Soviet Union now has over one thousand SS20 warheads, two-thirds of which are targeted on Europe. If the Soviet Union does not recognise over the coming months the legitimate anxieties of the West by agreeing to our proposals to eliminate this class of weapons, we will start deploying cruise missiles by the end of this year. Even after this, the West will remain entirely ready to negotiate for the removal of some or all of the missiles which we deploy, on the basis of a balanced and fair agreement with the Soviet Union.  The Western Alliance can keep the peace only if we can convince any potential aggressor that he would have to pay an unacceptable price. To do so, NATO must have strong conventional forces backed by a nuclear deterrent. And we in Britain must maintain our own independent nuclear contribution to British and European defence. At the same time, we shall continue to support all realistic efforts to reach balanced and verifiable agreements with the Soviet Union on arms control and disarmament.  We have substantially increased our defence expenditure in real terms. We have honoured our promise to give our regular and reserve forces proper pay and conditions and the equipment they need to do the job.  There could be no greater testimony to the professional dedication and the quality of equipment of the British Armed Services than the brilliant recapture of the Falkland Islands in just 74 days. We take pride in their achievement.  CIVIL DEFENCE  Our overriding desire and policy is to go on preserving peace.  However, no responsible government can simply assume that we shall never be attacked. To plan for civil defence is a humanitarian duty - not only against the possibility of nuclear. but also of conventional attack.  That is why we must take steps to provide the help that could be vital for millions. To proclaim a nuclear-free zone, as some Labour councils have, is a delusion.  The Conservative Government has accordingly carried out a thorough review of civil defence, brought forward new regulations to require local authorities to provide improved protection, strengthened the UK Warning and Monitoring Organisations, and nearly doubled spending on civil defence.  We propose to amend the Civil Defence Act 1948 to enable civil defence funds to be used in safeguarding against peacetime emergencies as well as against hostile attacks.  BRITAIN IN EUROPE  The creation of the European Community has been vital in cementing lasting peace in Europe and ending centuries of hostility. We came to office determined to make a success of British membership of the Community. This we have done.  Our first priority in 1979 was to cut our financial contribution to the Community Budget to a fairer level. Labour made a song and dance about renegotiating the terms, but had achieved nothing. The bill to British taxpayers soared.  We have stood up for Britain's interests, and substantially reduced our net contribution to the Community Budget. We have tenaciously sought a permanent alternative to the annual wrangles about refunds. Until we secure a lasting solution, we shall make sure of proper interim safeguards for this country. Meanwhile, with the help of Conservatives in the European Parliament, we shall continue to try to shift the Community's spending priorities away from agriculture and towards industrial, regional and other policies which help Britain more.  We shall continue both to oppose petty acts of Brussels bureaucracy and to seek the removal of unnecessary restrictions on the free movement of goods and services between member states, with proper safeguards to guarantee fair competition.  The Labour Party wants Britain to withdraw from the Community, because it fears that Britain cannot compete inside and that it would be easier to build a Socialist siege economy if we withdrew. The Liberals and the SDP appear to want Britain to stay in but never to upset our partners by speaking up forcefully. The Conservatives reject both extreme views.  The European Community is the world's largest trading group. It is by far our most important export market. Withdrawal would be a catastrophe for this country. As many as two million jobs would be at risk. We would lose the great export advantages and the attraction to overseas investors which membership now gives us. It would be a fateful step towards isolation, at which only the Soviet Union and her allies would rejoice.  A TRADING NATION  Our most important contribution to a healthy world economy is to manage our own affairs successfully. We shall also build on our important role in promoting international action to encourage recovery through the IMF and other international organisations. With the other leading industrial nations, we shall continue with our realistic initiatives to improve currency stability in the Western world, and assist nations with excessive debts to regain stability. Together with the Community, we are also playing a leading part in preserving an open world trading system, while safeguarding our most vulnerable industries.  While world trade declined last year, our exports and share of world trade increased, and we enjoyed a healthy balance of payments surplus, despite the pessimists who said the pound was uncompetitive. We believe in reinforcing success. This Government has given wholehearted support to British companies tendering for major overseas projects, and helped them secure many important contracts in the face of the toughest competition.  We will build on these initiatives to help our exporters, and vigorously promote the interests of British trade and industry in international negotiations - where we have already made our presence very effectively felt. We have no intention of becoming a dumping ground for the goods of other nations. We shall continue to challenge other nations' unfair barriers, whether in the shape of tariffs or trading practices.  OUR WIDER ROLE  In a troubled world, Britain is increasingly respected because we stand up for our own interests. But we are also respected because we stand up for the cause of freedom and the spread of prosperity throughout the world.  We resisted unprovoked aggression in the Falkland Islands, when the loyal support of our friends throughout the world reminded us of our common heritage of freedom. We will continue to uphold the principles for which we fought.  We shall continue to give our full support to the Commonwealth and to play an active and constructive part at the United Nations.  Our generous but carefully controlled aid programme is both an investment in the freedom and prosperity of the poorer countries and in a stable and expanding world economy. That programme helps us as well as those who receive it, since most of it is spent on British goods and services. More than many other nations, we direct our aid to the poorest countries, particularly in the Commonwealth.  But government aid is only a part of the total help we give the developing world. Unlike the Labour Party, we believe in permitting a free and profitable outflow of British investment. That flow to poorer countries has now grown far larger than British Government aid, bringing with it an invaluable transfer of skills and technology.  THE RESOLUTE APPROACH  This Government's approach is straightforward and resolute. We mean what we say. We face the truth, even when it is painful. And we stick to our purpose.  Most decisions worth taking are difficult. Cutting a clear path through the jungle of a modern bureaucracy is hard going. The world recession of the past four years, and the high level of unemployment throughout the industrial world, have made the going harder.  During these difficult years, we have protected the sick and the elderly. We have maintained Britain's defences and her contribution to the Western Alliance. And at the same time, we have laid the foundations for a dynamic and prosperous future.  The rewards are beginning to appear. If we continue on our present course with courage and commonsense, those rewards should multiply in the next five years.  We shall never lose sight of the British traditions of fairness and tolerance. We are also determined to revive those other British qualities - a genius for invention and a spirit of enterprise.  Under Conservative government, confidence is brushing aside pessimism at home. Abroad, Britain is regarded for the first time in years as a country with a great future as well as a great past.  We mean to make that future a reality. "
"Labour",198706,"Britain will win with Labour  INTRODUCTION  BY THE LEADER OF THE LABOUR PARTY  Every election is a time of decision. But this General Election on June 11 faces the British people with choices more sharp than at any time in the past fifty years.  The choices are between Labour's programme of work for people and Tory policies of waste of people: between investment in industrial strength, and acceptance of industrial decline; between a Britain with competitive, modern industries, and a Britain with a low tech, low paid, low security economy increasingly dependent upon imports.  The election will decide whether we and our children are to live in a country that builds high standards of care for all who need treatment for illness, pensions in retirement, good grounding in education, fair chances to get on; or in a country where the Conservatives go on running down the vital health, education and social services of every community, imposing higher charges and lower standards.  This election will decide whether our country is to be a United Kingdom or a divided kingdom; one that is brought together by proper provision, prudent investment and concern for the interests of the whole nation, or one that is pulled apart by poverty, cuts, increased privilege for the richest and neglect for the rest.  This election will decide whether we put our resources into the real defence provided by a modern, well-equipped army, navy and airforce safeguarding our country an d supporting NATO; or spend those sums on maintaining an ageing system of nuclear weapons, while buying a new generation of missiles which cannot give our country effective defence. It will decide whether Britain is part of the international process of nuclear build down or ruled by a government uniquely intent upon nuclear build-up.  We already know what a third term for Mrs Thatcher would mean for the people of Britain.  Under the Tories there have been:  Eight years of record unemployment, relentless industrial closures and redundancies, of flooding imports and shrunken investment.  Eight years of the highest ever tax burden on the family and the nation as VAT, National Insurance, rates and fees have all been put up in a shift to taxes on spending and employment.  Eight years of cuts and closures and charges, of intensified means tests and reduced services.  Eight years of increased state control, of centralising government of abolition of rights of representation and negotiation.  Eight years of rising crime, of greater insecurity on the streets and housing estates and in the home.  Eight years of meanness towards the needy in our country and towards the wretched of the world.  Eight years of growing division - in health in opportunity, in housing conditions in work and in income - between regions communities classes, families, white and black, rich and poor.  The Tories say they are 'proud of their record'. So proud indeed that they would want to do more of the same if they were re-elected.  Their plans for a poll tax would penalise millions of families, pensioners and young people. Their refusal to provide the resources needed for the Health Service and their plans for imposing further payment and privatisation will hit everyone in the service and everyone needing to use it.  They would, if they won power again, privatise water, electricity, steel and other services, and industries built up by public investment over past years. They want to impose penal increases in rents for private and public tenants. They are committed to introducing compulsory labour for young unemployed people.  All this and worse would come with a third term of Tory government.  Britain cannot afford more of that run-down, sell-off and split-up, nor all the costs and waste that they bring.  Britain does not have to.  Britain can stop the rot - but only by voting Labour.  There is no other way to prevent thirteen years of Thatcherism.  No party other than Labour can possibly win enough seats to form a government.  The Liberals and SDP know that. Their hope is to profit from confusion. To divide the non-Conservative vote in such a way as to make them the 'hook' in a 'hung' Parliament and have power far beyond their responsibility.  And, while one of their leaders clearly favours an arrangement to sustain a Conservative government, the other hasn't the strength to stop him.  That offers no way ahead for a nation that needs to get on with investing for change, for quality, for confidence in the future.  Proper support for education, strengthened research and development and long-term, low interest finance for industrial growth are all essential if Britain is to gain the vitality necessary to outpace competitors who have been building these assets for years.  They are essential too if we are to generate the wealth needed for the security, care and opportunity fundamental to the individual freedom of women and men of all ages and origins. When our country faces the common pressures on the environment, the common dangers of crime, the common costs of unemployment, under-investment and under-performance together, our country has every commonsense reason to meet those challenges together.  That is democratic socialism in action. And just as a family uses its combined spirit and resources to overcome crisis, so Britain can once again make common cause to achieve common good.  Only a Labour government can give that lead. Only we are committed to such concerted action. Only we believe that the whole nation should win and can win.  That is why Britain will win, with Labour.  NEIL KINNOCK  BRITAIN WILL WIN  Britain is crying out for change. Only a Labour government can bring it about.  MENDING DIVISIONS, BUILDING NEW STRENGTHS WILL NEED DETERMINATION AND REALISTIC PRIORITIES.  COMMONSENSE AND THE COMMON INTEREST REQUIRE THAT THE TORY PHILOSOPHY OF SELFISHNESS AND SHORT-TERM GAIN IS REPLACED BY THE DEMOCRATIC SOCIALIST PHILOSOPHY OF COMMUNITY AND CARING, OF INVESTMENT IN PEOPLE AND IN PRODUCTION.  WE MUST AS A PRIORITY TACKLE THE IMMEDIATE TRAGEDY AND WASTE OF UNEMPLOYMENT. WE MUST COMMIT RESOURCES TO MODERNISING AND STRENGTHENING THE INDUSTRIES AND SERVICES THAT EARN BRITAIN A LIVING. WE MUST ENSURE THE CONTINUITY OF EXPANSION THAT IS NECESSARY FOR A LASTING ECONOMIC RECOVERY.  THAT IS OUR STRATEGY.  IT BEGINS FROM THE UNDERSTANDING THAT PEOPLE ARE BRITAIN'S MOST PRECIOUS RESOURCE. IT IS ROOTED IN THE CONFIDENCE THAT, WITH THE RIGHT SKILLS, THE RIGHT EQUIPMENT AND THE BACKING OF A GOVERNMENT THAT IS COMMITTED TO ENCOURAGING ENTERPRISE AND INNOVATION, BRITAIN'S PEOPLE CAN MAKE OUR COUNTRY MORE EFFICIENT, MORE COMPETITIVE AND MORE SOCIALLY JUST.  IT IS A MESSAGE OF HOPE AND CONFIDENCE - THE ALTERNATIVE TO THE DIVISIVE AND DICTATORIAL APPROACH OF THE CONSERVATIVES.  WE DO NOT BELIEVE THAT EVERYTHING COULD OR SHOULD BE DONE BY GOVERNMENT. BUT WE KNOW, FROM OUR OWN HISTORY AND FROM THE EXAMPLE SET BY OUR COMPETITORS, THAT NATIONAL ECONOMIC SUCCESS CANNOT BE ACHIEVED WITHOUT GOVERNMENT.  BRITAIN WILL WIN WITH A LABOUR GOVERNMENT THAT INVESTS TO ENABLE PEOPLE TO USE THEIR ABILITIES AND TO STIMULATE MODERN TRAINING, RESEARCH, DEVELOPMENT, PRODUCTION AND MARKETING. THESE ARE THE INGREDIENTS OF ECONOMIC VITALITY, AND THE FOUNDATIONS OF FAIRNESS.  THE PRIORITY PROGRAMME  For our first two years in government we Will concentrate resources on the essential tasks of combating unemployment and poverty In the course of that action, we will strengthen the health, housing, education, social services and crime-fighting services that are vital to social and economic well-being, and begin to rebuild our manufacturing industry.  Clearly, all other programmes that require substantial public finance must take lower priority in terms of timescale and public resources.  THE JOBS PROGRAMME  Immediately after the election the Labour Government will call together A NATIONAL ECONOMIC SUMMIT to assess fully the condition of the economy and set the recovery programme in motion - producing the jobs that need to be done by people who need to do them in a country that wants them done.  The Summit will establish the first stage of the National Economic Assessment. This will identify the concerted action that will need to be taken by government, employers in the private and public sectors and trade unions to increase investment, contain inflation and achieve sustained recovery.  WE WILL REDUCE UNEMPLOYMENT BY ONE MILLION IN TWO YEARS as the first instalment in beating mass unemployment.  Half a million jobs will be generated in private industry and in the public sector by the repairing and building of the houses, the hospitals and schools, the transport improvements and sewers that the nation needs. This will be achieved by public investment and by reducing employers' National Insurance contribution in targeted areas.  Another 360,000 new jobs and training places will be created. These will provide new skills for young people and adults - with proper opportunities for women.  A further 300,000 new jobs will improve the health and education services and the neglected community and caring services. The depleted customs services will be strengthened in the fight against drugs. The revenue and benefit departments will be staffed to increase efficiency.  We will extend the voluntary Job Release Scheme to men over 60 so that those who want to retire early vacate jobs for those who are currently unemployed. This could take as many as 160,000 people out of unemployment and into work.  THE ANTI-POVERTY PROGRAMME  The spread of poverty in the past eight years has stained the whole nation, and widened misery and disadvantage amongst old and young. Much of it is the result of deliberate government policies. Millions of poor people endure it in despair. Millions who are not poor regard it as a disgrace. The Labour government will combat poverty directly.  WE WILL IMMEDIATELY INCREASE THE SINGLE PENSION BY £5 A WEEK AND THE PENSION FOR A MARRIED COUPLE BY £8, AS THE FIRST STEP IN RE-ESTABLISHING A LINK BETWEEN PENSIONS AND AVERAGE EARNINGS OR LIVING COSTS, WHICHEVER IS THE MOST FAVOURABLE TO PENSIONERS. WE WILL BEGIN THE ABOLITION OF THE TV LICENCE FEE FOR PENSIONERS.  We will provide pensioners on supplementary benefit and others on low incomes with a £5 winter premium to help with fuel bills. We will begin discussions with the fuel industries with a view to phasing out standing charges.  We will fully restore the State Earnings Related Pension Scheme as part of the process of achieving our objective of a pensions level of one-third average earnings for single people and half average earnings for married couples.  We will restore and increase the death grant.  We will increase child benefit by £3 a week for all children, raise the allowance to the first child by £7,36, and increase one- parent family benefit by £2,20.  We will restore and increase the maternity grant.  We will start to phase in a new disability income scheme and provide resources to give special support to young people with disabilities. Our special Minister for the Disabled will be put in charge of our programme for the disabled.  We will extend the long-term supplementary benefit rate to the long-term unemployed.  We will implement a comprehensive STRATEGY FOR ENDING LOW PAY, notably by the introduction of a statutory national minimum wage. This will be of particular benefit to women workers, and will help lift families out of poverty.  THE ANTI-CRIME PROGRAMME  We will introduce crime prevention grants for home-owners and tenants.  We will work with the police to get MORE POLICE ON THE BEAT. Uniformed police officers will be relieved of non-law-and-order tasks which take them away from crime prevention, pursuit and detection.  We will reverse the Tory cuts in the number of those who can claim criminal injuries compensation. We will give the Criminal Injuries Compensation Board more staff to cut the all-time record 64,000 queue awaiting compensation.  PAYING FOR THE RECOVERY PROGRAMME  These immediate programmes will cost £6 billion a year net for the first two years. We will pay for them by:  - Putting directly into generating 300,000 jobs the money that would be used up by the Thatcher government on its 2p income tax bribe.  - Adopting the same practice as most successful industrial countries and companies, by prudently borrowing £3 billion for useful wealth generating national investment.  We will reverse the extra tax cuts which the richest 5 per cent have received from the Tory government and allocate that money instead to the most needy. We will also bring forward other reforms to capital taxation - including the introduction of a wealth tax, which, whilst applying to only the wealthiest one per cent of the population, will, over the years, bring a significant contribution from those in our society best able to pay.  CHANGES WITHOUT CHARGES  Apart from legislating where necessary for the Recovery Programme, the new Parliament will swiftly enact many other worthwhile measures. These will cost little to implement but produce significant improvement in the quality of administration, provision and response to the needs of ordinary citizens.  They will include:  - A MINISTER FOR WOMEN, with a place in the Cabinet.  - A Freedom of Information Act, to be accompanied by the repeal of Section Two of the Official Secrets Act.  - Parliamentary scrutiny of the Security Services.  - Appointment of an Education Ombudsman.  - Appointment of an Ombudsman for Police Complaints.  - An Energy Efficiency Agency to co-ordinate conservation programmes for domestic and industrial energy users.  - A new Ministry of Environmental Protection.  PROGRAMME FOR A FIVE-YEAR PARLIAMENT  Labour's Programme for Recovery will be the start of a strategy for a full Parliament. We have to halt the decline in manufacturing industry, not only to generate jobs and increase our world trade share but to create the wealth to finance the rescue and expansion of education, health, housing and the social services.  NEW STRENGTH FOR INDUSTRY  For eight years British industry has been left to drift and decline Our oil revenues have been wasted and the City has concentrated upon short-term movements of capital at the expense of British manufacturing industry. The huge capital outflow of £110 billion since 1979 is ruinous evidence of the Tories' lack of concern for the strength of the British economy.  Labour is committed to REBUILDING OUR INDUSTRIAL BASE. Our country must make the best use of computers and information technology to develop the modern means of making a living as the oil runs down and the pressures of technical change and international competition intensify.  We will:  - Establish a capital repatriation scheme using the tax system to attract and retain British savings and investment in Britain.  - Set up the British Industrial Investment Bank, with strong bases in Scotland, Wales and English regions, to ensure finance for industry where it is needed, when it is needed and on terms which encourage long term development.  - Implement a dynamic and properly funded REGIONAL POLICY. This will include the establishment of Regional Development Agencies (starting with the North, North-West, Yorkshire and Humberside); the promotion of local and regional enterprise boards; greater scope for local authorities to participate constructively in economic development; and creating high technology innovation centres throughout Britain.  - Create a new Ministry of Science and Technology to promote a major increase in research and development.It will co-ordinate the activities and budgets of government departments involved in these areas and will encourage, in conjunction with industry and the scientific community, the full application of science to industrial processes and products.  - We shall extend social ownership by a variety of means, as set out in Labour's detailed proposals. In particular, we will set up British Enterprise, to take a socially owned stake in high-tech industries and other concerns where public funds are used to strengthen investment. Social ownership of basic utilities like gas and water is vital to ensure that every individual has access to their use and that the companies contribute to Britain's industrial recovery, for instance, by buying British. We shall start by using the exist mg 49 per cent holding in British Telecom to ensure proper influence in their decisions. Private shares in BT and British Gas will be converted into special new securities. These will be bought and sold in the market in the usual way and will carry either a guaranteed return, or dividends linked to the company's growth.  - Encourage the establishment and success of co-operatives of all forms.  - Strengthen the Department of Trade and Industry as the spearhead of this new national industrial strategy.  - Bring in a stronger regulatory framework to ensure honest PRACTICE IN THE CITY OF LONDON and introduce new SAFEGUARDS on mergers, takeovers and monopolies to protect our national industrial, technological and research and development interests.  PLAN FOR TRAINING  For modern, wealth-creating industry we need a well-trained workforce. British industry now carries out less than half of the training of our main competitors. Labour will therefore establish a national training programme to bring about a major advance in the spread and standard of skills.  For young people we will establish an integrated, high quality FOUNDATION PROGRAMME that will guarantee for all 16 year olds at least two years OF EDUCATION, TRAINING AND WORK EXPERIENCE according to their needs.  The Adult Skillplan will develop lifelong training and education for everyone needing to supplement and update skills in work, with particular emphasis given to training for women.  The Jobs, Enterprise and Training Programme will expand existing programmes for unemployed people with a guarantee of a job or new skill for the long-term unemployed.  A SENSIBLE ENERGY POLICY  Efficiency in industry and security in the community both depend on reliable and safe supplies of energy available at acceptable cost. Britain's oil reserves have a limited life. We have huge reserves of coal which will last for centuries. Labour's co-ordinated energy programme will ensure the most sensible use of our reserves while protecting our environ ment and stimulating employment.  Labour will initiate a MAJOR ENERGY CONSERVATION PROGRAMME and ensure that Britain develops the full potential of its coal, oil and gas resources, whilst gradually diminishing Britain's dependence upon nuclear energy.  We will invest substantially in research into, and development of, the renewable energy resources as part of the alternative means of power.  We will not proceed with the building of the proposed Pressurised Water Reactor at Sizewell.  We share national concern about the problem of nuclear waste. We will ensure a safe future for Sellafield and develop a new strategy for the monitoring, storage and disposal of nuclear waste.  Labour will take effective steps to improve the service provided by the energy industry to energy consumers. These will cover quality of supply, frequency of metering, general service arrangements and proper provision for the disabled, those in poverty and others with special needs.  A PROSPEROUS AGRICULTURE  A more efficient agricultural industry can clearly make a valuable contribution to Britain's recovery. We will support good environmental practices in agriculture.  To give Britain's producers the backing they need, the burden of agricultural support must be shifted from consumers. The direction of support must be shifted away from blanket support for commodities, towards helping the farmers who need it most, such as those who work in the hills or on marginal land. To help bring this about we will introduce new, long-term programmes for agriculture.  We will also help new farmers and young farmers by offering farms to rent. And we will reverse the cuts in the Agricultural Development and Advisory Service and research.  FREEDOM AND FAIRNESS FOR ALL BRITAIN'S PEOPLE  We are determined to make Britain a fairer and freer society.  To us and to the majority of the British people a civilised community is one in which citizens band together to provide, out of community resources to which all contribute, essential services like health, education and pensions that the great majority of people can not afford to provide for themselves at time of need.  When the Tories talk of freedom, they mean freedom for the few, for those who can afford to buy privilege. What they mean, as their record so plainly shows, is more tax cuts for the rich and less help for the poor and for that great majority who are neither rich nor poor.  Labour's objective is to broaden and deepen THE LIBERTY of all individuals in our community: to free people from poverty, exploitation and fear, to free them to realise their full potential, to see that everyone has the liberty TO ENJOY REAL CHANCES, TO MAKE REAL CHOICES.  It means collective provision for private use. The British people know that this is the most effective way for them to secure their freedom as individuals whilst meeting the moral obligations which they feel towards others and seeing that fairness is a way of national life, not just a fine word.  These values are the essence of our democratic socialism.  INVESTING IN HEALTH  Labour's proudest achievement is the creation of the National Health Service. The Conservatives voted against it then. All who use and value the service know only too well how it has been neglected and downgraded by today's Tories.  Labour will establish the NHS in its rightful place as a high quality service for the prevention and treatment of illness, free at the time of use to all who need attention, equipped to meet the changing pressures of need as they relate, for instance, to an aging population and the requirements of proper provision for people suffering from mental illness.  The biggest single deficiency in the NHS today is the excessively high hospital waiting lists which, under the Tories, are increasing year by year. We shall speedily REDUCE them by computerising bed allocation, encouraging more consultants to work full-time for the NHS and targeting increased resources where WAITING LISTS remain excessive.  The basis of the NHS is the Family Doctor Service We shall act to improve it, with shorter GP patient lists, more convenient surgery hours, more choice and information for patients.  We will develop local family health care teams and more local health centres.  WOMEN'S HEALTH CARE has been seriously neglected. Our Charter for Womens' Health will include a network of Well-Women Clinics, and a computerised call and recall screening system as a universal service for all women at risk of cervical and breast cancer. We shall see that all women have the chance to see a woman doctor if they choose.  We will step up the fight against AIDS by increasing research resources to find a vaccine or cure and also ensure adequate resources for the supply of drugs capable of arresting the affliction.  We will improve outpatient and emergency facilities and ambulance services and repair and build hospitals. We intend to improve both the quantity and quality of services for the National Health. The Tories have increased PRESCRIPTION CHARGES twelve fold. We will begin to REDUCE THEM with the purpose of securing their eventual abolition.  Labour will ensure that nurses get proper and justified pay increases by right and regularly, not exceptionally as pre-election sweeteners. Other hospital staff, on whom the effective running of the service depends, must also be fairly rewarded as part of the effective health team.  Privatisation means a Health Service run for profit rather than in the patients' interests. Labour will end privatisation in the NHS, relieve the pressure on NHS facilities by beginning to phase out pay beds and remove public subsidies to private health.  A CARING COMMUNITY  The quality of life of the elderly and of disabled people can and must be improved by community services. We believe that retirement should be comfortable and interesting - a time of freedom and choice, not anxiety and loneliness. We believe that disability should not be a disqualification from good standards of living and liberty.  Apart from our commitment to higher pensions and the beginning of a new disablement allowance, Labour will support the National Health Service and local government in providing more meals on wheels, home helps, chiropody services and health visitors.  We also recognise the immense contribution of the three million people - mostly women - who care for their elderly, infirm and disabled relatives at home. They save the community huge sums of money, often at considerable sacrifice to themselves. The Labour government will consequently provide A CARER'S ALLOWANCE to give extra help to those who serve their loved ones and our society so well.  We appreciate and will support voluntary efforts that supplement services which are essential to the community. We share the view of many who are engaged in such efforts that they achieve best results working in the context of high quality public provision.  EDUCATION FOR BRITAIN'S FUTURE  Our children are our future. We have a moral and material duty to see that children and young people are fully equipped to deal with the complexities and challenges which face them now and which they will meet as citizens; parents and workers in the future.  They must be provided with a system of education that enables them to control that future. We must see that it is democratic and just, that it is creative and compassionate, and that it is one in which they can fully exploit the advantages of science and technology with confidence and in safety.  In pursuit of those objectives, Labour will invest in education so that the abilities of all children and adults from all home back grounds and in every part of our country are discovered and nourished.  We will make NURSERY EDUCATION AVAILABLE FOR ALL THREE- AND FOUR-YEAR-OLDS whose parents want this opportunity. We will make provision for smaller classes and ensure that children have up-to-date books, equipment and buildings without having to depend on fund-raising for those essentials.  The entitlement to free school meals and the restoration of nutritional standards are, like the strengthening of the school health service, commitments which are necessary to safeguard the physical and social wellbeing of growing children.  We will see that teachers are recognised properly as well qualified professionals, in their systems of rewards, in the procedures for negotiation of their employment conditions and in participation in the development of education.  In addition we shall work with local education authorities to secure a flexible but clear core curriculum agreed at national level, a School Standards Council, and a new profile of achievement recording individual progress through school for all pupils. We will improve links between schools and home so that PARENTS AND TEACHERS act IN PARTNERSHIP to foster the best interests of children.  We shall foster achievement with other policies such as providing proper funding for the GCSE curriculum and examination, for improved supply of teachers and equipment for science subjects so that girls as well as boys increase science learning. There will be maintenance allowances for 16- to 18-year- olds whose family circumstances would other wise impede their further education.  We will spread the provision of a comprehensive tertiary system of post-school education.  These policies will all contribute to RAISING STANDARDS OF PERFORMANCE IN SCHOOLS. At the same time as we improve the quality of publicly provided education, we shall end the 11 plus everywhere and stop the diverting of precious resources that occurs through the Assisted Places Scheme and the public subsidies to private schools.  Labour values the research and teaching contribution made by Britain's higher education system. We will ensure that our universities and polytechnics get the resources they need to restore and expand the opportunity for all qualified young people seeking higher education to secure places. We will ensure that more adults have access to higher education to give them the 'second chance' of personal development.  We will also invest in research in higher education, in order to provide the facilities and opportunities necessary to sustain standards of excellence, to retain and attract the highest talents and to encourage the industrial and commercial application of research output.  Education for life through a well-funded adult education service will help to provide the means by which rapid economic and social change can be embraced.  REAL CHOICE IN HOUSING  Public funding for housing has fallen by 60 per cent during Mrs Thatcher's eight years in office. Far fewer homes are being built. Millions of dwellings are in serious disrepair. Yet there is record unemployment among building workers. This policy is immoral and grossly inefficient. Labour will reverse it. We will also improve the quality of housing workmanship and establish a new system of registration in the construction industry.  We will launch a MAJOR HOUSEBUILDING AND public and private sector housing RENOVATION DRIVE as part of our jobs programme and to combat the problems of bad housing, over crowding and homelessness. Owner occupiers will benefit from increased availability of improvement grants.  We will maintain mortgage tax relief, at the standard rate of income tax. To assist house-purchasers we will introduce a housing 'log book', giving each dwelling's history, condition and construction so that purchasers will know exactly what they are buying. This will be transferred with the sale.  For council tenants, we will MAINTAIN THE RIGHT TO BUY. Local authorities, at present limited by the Tories in using the receipts from council house sales, will be required to use these proceeds to invest in new housing. For the millions who choose to remain council tenants, we will give a legal right to be consulted about rents, charges, repair and improvement programmes. Tenants' associations will be given representation in the decision-making structure and a say in spending budgets on their estates.  Groups of tenants who want to take over the running of their homes will have the right to set up management co-operatives.  Leaseholders who own their homes will be given the legal right to acquire their freeholds at fair prices and without the costly current impediments to that right. Leaseholders in flats will get the legal right to hire and fire the managing agents in blocks of flats. They will be empowered to have the freeholder's accounts examined by an auditor of their choice and be given the legal right to extend their lease.  Security of tenure will be protected for private tenants. These tenants will be given a legal right to get repairs done.  PROTECTING OUR PEOPLE  The Thatcher government has broken its promises on law and order. Last year 4,311,000 crimes were committed in Britain. The clear-up rate fell to 32 per cent. Millions of women are scared to go out at night. Many old people lock themselves into their homes. Drug trafficking is increasing.  Labour will take urgent action to make people safer.  Our CRIME PREVENTION PROGRAMME will:  - Help local councils to implement a Safer Streets policy, with more street-lighting, more caretakers, park-keepers and other public employees whose presence deters crime.  - Bring in a Safe Estates Policy, assisting councils to provide stronger locks, stouter doors and vandal-proof windows for tenants and home-owners - especially older citizens - who have difficulty in meeting the costs of such security improvements.  - Introduce a Safer Transport policy, to protect passengers and crews, including better services, especially at night, adequate staffing, better sited bus stops and well-lit stations with alarm buttons.  - Lay down crime prevention standards for buildings, open spaces and vehicles to combat vandalism and to deter criminals.  - Combat violence against women - specially domestic violence - by seeing that the laws that already exist against beating and abuse are vigorously enforced.  Our VICTIM SUPPORT PROGRAMME will fund a national network of victim support schemes, providing practical help to victims of all crime, ranging from victims of rape and child abuse to mugging and burglary victims.  We shall assist family and support groups in their efforts to work with professionals in the health, education and other services and within the community to deal with the great and growing problem of drug abuse.  Locally elected police authorities will be given clear statutory responsibility with the police to enforce the law and uphold the Queen's peace. The police themselves will remain responsible for all operational matters.  Fraud in the City of London is a serious crime. Too many get away with it. Labour will bring in effective regulation by establishing an independent statutory commission.  MAKING TRAVEL EASIER  Efficient, inexpensive public transport is essential in any society. Tory policies have made travel more difficult by cutting services and pushing up fares. Deregulation of buses has brought chaos to many parts of the country both in towns and cities and in the rural areas where efficient and cheap public transport is so important.  Labour will invest to co-ordinate and improve bus and rail services, which will improve travel and reduce congestion. There will be Local Transport Plans for every area.  Action will be taken to keep fares down. There will be good CONCESSIONARY FARE SCHEMES for local travel for pensioners and people with disabilities.  We shall promote services for those with special needs, such as dial-a-ride and taxicard schemes offering cheap travel for the disabled.  We shall invest to ensure a continuing future for British Rail Engineering as a high-quality supplier both for British Rail and to world markets.  A SAFER ENVIRONMENT  The countryside and the urban areas all suffer from pollution and the misuse of the environment. Labour will establish a MINISTRY OF ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION to take positive action to safeguard the quality and safety of life.  We will:  - Set up an Environmental Protection Service and a Wildlife and Countryside Service.  - Extend the planning system to cover agricultural forestry and water developments requiring them, and industry, to take account of environmental considerations.  - Invest more in land reclamation and cleaning up, in recycling and conservation, in development of new products, processes and pollution control equipment. This will not only make the country cleaner but will create jobs as well.  - Take action to deal with acid rain.  - Stop radio-active discharges into our seas and oppose the dumping of nuclear waste at sea.  - Provide for better monitoring, inspection and enforcement of pollution control, to cover areas ranging from air pollution to beaches, from hazardous chemicals to food additives, and from water quality to vehicle emissions.  - PROTECT GREEN BELTS and other specially designated areas.  - Bring in a new Wildlife and Countryside Act and provide for public access to all common land, mountain, moor and heath.  - End all forms of organised hunting with hounds. Special account will be taken of the conditions applying in National Parks. These changes will not affect shooting and fishing.  - Update animal protection legislation - for example, to eliminate unnecessary experimenting on live animals.  STRENGTHENING DEMOCRACY  We will seek to strengthen parliamentary democracy and introduce state aid for political parties, along the lines of the Houghton Report.  We shall establish a new democratically-elected STRATEGIC AUTHORITY FOR LONDON and consult widely about the most effective regional structure of government and administration in England and Wales.  SCOTLAND  We shall legislate in the first Parliamentary session to establish a democratically-elected SCOTTISH ASSEMBLY in Edinburgh. This will have a wide range of powers over health, education and housing and over significant aspects of industrial and economic policy. It will take responsibility for changes in the structure of Scottish local government.  WALES  Wales and the Welsh economy will clearly benefit from Labour's programme for investment in jobs and vital services. In addition, the WELSH DEVELOPMENT AGENCY will be given greater powers and funds and there will be a new Wales Economic Planning Council. Welsh agriculture will benefit from our measures to help the livestock farmers especially the marginal and hill farmers.  A separate Arts Council for Wales will be established and the development of the use and choice of the Welsh language will be encouraged.  NORTHERN IRELAND  Labour's policies for economic renewal are essential to combat the record unemployment and social deprivation in Northern Ireland and to encourage the economic security which is fundamental to the development of harmony and trust in the community.  We believe in a united Ireland: to be achieved peacefully, democratically, and by consent. We consequently SUPPORT THE ANGLO-IRISH AGREEMENT and its commitment that there should be no change in the constitutional position of Northern Ireland without the con sent of the majority of the people who live there. No group or party will be allowed to exercise a veto on political development, or on policies designed to win consent.  We will combat para-military violence from wherever it comes. We will promote discussions aimed at encouraging mutual confidence and eliminating conflict whilst ensuring that the respective identities and basic rights of both communities will be protected. We will replace present strip-searching practice with more effective and acceptable security measures.  LOCAL DEMOCRACY  The Tory government has undermined local democracy and plans to continue to diminish the importance of votes in local elections.  It has made huge cuts in rate support grant and imposed financial penalties to prevent councils maintaining and improving the quality of essential local services. Employment, and sensible and sensitive investment in local communities and their services, have been damaged.  Labour will restore the right of councils to decide their own policies and plans, which will be subject to the decisions of local people at ANNUAL LOCAL ELECTIONS.  We will halt the cuts in rate support grant and end financial penalties. We will make the legal liabilities of councillors similar to those of Ministers and Company Directors by ending surcharge and disqualification except for criminal offences.  We will abolish the Rates Act and REPEAL the legislation which established THE POLL TAX IN SCOTLAND.  We will give local authorities the necessary powers to enable them to build on existing successful initiatives for enterprise and employment, to develop new technologies and to train young people.  Labour will examine the structure of local government to ensure that it is democratic and effective. We will ESTABLISH A NEW QUALITY COMMISSION to ensure the spread of 'best practice', efficiency and high standards of local authority provision and response to the public.  NEW LIFE FOR INNER CITIES  Except where it has turned areas over to speculators so that they can create luxury accommodation at astronomical prices, this government has left inner-city areas to rot.  Experience has shown that the Conservatives' City Action Teams have never had the means or the purpose of making any real impact on inner city problems.  Tory cuts in funding and in housing, together with mass unemployment, have turned too many of our urban areas into dingy, hopeless places.  Yet the people who live there, given the chance, have the zest and initiative to make these areas thrive socially and economically.  Labour will launch a DRIVE AGAINST INNER-CITY DEPRIVATION both as a way of generating employment and as a means of making such areas safer and better places to live.  Labour's approach will be to develop the partnership between central and local government, with the direct participation of the voluntary and private sectors.  We will:  - Give local authorities in key areas the power to DECLARE PUBLIC ACTION ZONES. In these areas, local councils will have additional resources and powers to undertake programmes of investment. Land will be identified for housing, jobs and amenities and extra government resources allocated to help with comprehensive regeneration. Local people will be fully consulted about their needs and ideas.  - Strengthen the Urban Programme and Partnership Schemes.  - Make Urban Development Grants available for local needs.  - Increase resources for reclaiming derelict land.  RURAL AREAS  Under the Tories, the problems of the rural areas have become steadily more serious - the lack of jobs, the poor housing, and the loss of buses, post offices, shops and schools.  Labour will give our rural communities the chance to thrive again. Our policies include better public transport, NEW MOBILE FACILITIES FOR HEALTH CARE AND SOCIAL SERVICES and extra help to keep open local schools and post offices.  ENHANCING RIGHTS, INCREASING FREEDOM  Under the Conservatives, Britain has become a harsher place. Freedoms built up over generations have been weakened or removed. Labour will restore and enhance those freedoms in a Britain where life can be more pleasant and fulfilling.  We believe that positive steps are needed to help women and ethnic minorities get a fair deal, and to attain more democracy in the workplace. In addition, we will take steps to ensure that homosexuals are not discriminated against.  WOMEN'S RIGHTS  More than half of Britain's people - the women of our country - are still denied many essential rights. Labour's MINISTRY FOR WOMEN will make sure that, in framing their policies, all government departments listen and respond to women's needs and concerns.  In particular, women must have the right to work and EQUAL RIGHTS AT WORK. In addition to our new provision for training opportunities and protection against discrimination, Labour will help the large number of women who are part-time workers. We will legislate for them to have the same hourly rates, rights to sick pay, paid holidays and job security as full-time workers.  We will give homeworkers the status and rights of employees; introduce effective laws for equal pay for work of equal value; provide better-paid leave for parents when their child is born; and encourage a shorter, more flexible working week.  DEMOCRACY IN THE WORKPLACE  Workers' rights have been eroded, or in some cases removed entirely, during the Thatcher years. Labour's policy for new rights and responsibilities means legislation to foster good industrial relations and democratic participation in industry and trade unions. We believe that the law should be used to enlarge, not diminish, the freedom of workers to control their environment.  We will:  - Replace Tory legislation that gives employers and non-unionists the means to frustrate legitimate trade union activity. New laws will strengthen the legal rights of representation, bargaining and trade unionism that are essential in a modern democracy.  - Improve the PROTECTION available AGAINST UNFAIR DISMISSAL. We shall make the legislation apply from the time of employment. Reinstatement will be the normal outcome of a successful finding of unfair treatment. We will ensure that justice is done in cases where miners have been unfairly dismissed.  - Extend employment protection to all workers, including part-timers.  - Improve statutory protection in respect of health and safety at work.  - Restore provision for fair pay, such as the Fair Wages Resolution, Schedule 11 of the 1975 Employment Protection Act and the powers of the Wages Councils.  - Strengthen ACAS to put more emphasis on conciliation and arbitration.  - Take steps to develop stable and effective negotiating machinery, promote trade union membership and organisation, and encourage union recognition by employers.  - Restore the RIGHT TO BELONG TO A TRADE UNION to every employee - including those at GCHQ.  - Ensure that the law guarantees the essential legal freedom of workers and their unions to organise effective industrial action.  - Provide a statutory framework of measures to underpin the participative rights of union members, for example by laying down general principles for inclusion in union rule books. These will be based on a RIGHT FOR UNION MEMBERS TO HAVE A SECRET BALLOT on decisions relating to strikes, and for the method of election of union executives to be based on a system of secret ballots.  - In consultation with the TUC, we will establish a new independent tribunal, presided over by a legally-qualified person. This will have the duty of acting on complaints by union members if they consider that these statutory principles have been breached.  EQUALITY FOR ETHNIC MINORITIES  All the people of this country - whatever their race, colour or religion - must enjoy the full rights of citizenship.  Our policies for employment, education, housing, health care, local government and much else will clearly be of benefit to people of the ethnic minorities as they will be to the whole community.  In addition, Labour will take firm action to PROMOTE RACIAL EQUALITY, to attack racial discrimination and to encourage contract compliance and other positive means of ensuring equity for all citizens. We will strengthen the law on public order to combat racial hatred and take firm action against the growing menace of racial attacks. We will make prosecution easier in order to encourage the reporting of offences.  Labour's policy of FIRM AND FAIR IMMIGRATION CONTROL will ensure that the law does not discriminate on the basis of race, colour or sex.  A BETTER DEAL FOR CONSUMERS  When people make a purchase, they often feel they are treated unfairly, or even cheated. Labour's Charter for Consumers will provide proper safeguards suited to modern conditions.  There will be firmer PROTECTION AGAINST UNSAFE GOODS. We will make producers strictly liable for defective products.  We will provide easier means of redress for purchasers and stiffer penalties to deter illegal practices.  We will take action to make sure that public bodies respond better to the needs and complaints of people who use their services.  We will bring in a statutory code of advertising practice. There will be powers to order the correction of misleading advertisements.  We will improve access to legal services where necessary.  There will be more safeguards for customers when companies go bankrupt.  TOWARDS A FULLER LIFE  Life is not only work. Labour will make pro vision for the co-ordination and development of leisure amenities and the leisure and cultural industries.  Our SUPPORT SPORT PROGRAMME will provide more resources for physical education and training through more playing fields and facilities, better equipment and well-trained teachers and instructors. We will nourish special talents and encourage wider participation in sport.  We will encourage schools to open up their recreational facilities to the whole community and prevent the selling off of school and other sports grounds.  We will set up a Sports Trust to channel resources into the development of community sporting facilities and the attraction of major international sporting events to Britain.  We will establish A MINISTRY FOR THE ARTS AND MEDIA with responsibility for the arts, crafts, public libraries, museums, film, publishing, the press, the record industry, the development of broadcasting and access to it, fashion, design, architecture and the heritage. The Home Office will remain responsible for regulatory and statutory powers in relation to broadcasting.  The development of central and local government support for the arts, culture and entertainment is essential to the extension of choice, access and participation, and to the development of the related industries.  We will PROTECT THE INDEPENDENCE OF THE BBC AND THE INDEPENDENT BROADCASTING ORGANISATIONS. We reject subscription TV for the BBC and the auctioning of ITV franchises.  We will legislate to ensure that ownership and control of the press and broadcasting media are retained by citizens of Britain and to place limits on the concentration of owner ship. We will strengthen the Press Council and set up a launch fund to assist new publications in order to encourage the diversity necessary in a healthy democracy.  MODERN BRITAIN IN A MODERN WORLD  The globe is torn by strife and oppression A Labour Britain must play its part in promoting freedom and reducing conflict.  Labour will play a full part in the United Nations Organisation and the Commonwealth.  Under the Conservatives, Britain picks and chooses which authoritarian countries to condemn and which to befriend. Labour will stand up for freedom wherever it is oppressed - whether in Eastern Europe, Latin America, Asia or Africa.  The Thatcher government has made no real effort to foster freedom in South Africa and Namibia. Labour will make the arms embargo complete, halt investment and commercial loans and ensure that British measures against apartheid embrace those already adopted by the US Congress, the Commonwealth and the EEC. We will support the imposition by the UN Security Council of COMPREHENSIVE MANDATORY ECONOMIC SANCTIONS and provide help to the Front Line States who bear the brunt of South African military and economic attack.  We uphold the principle that it is wrong for one country to dominate or threaten another. We oppose the Soviet presence in Afghanistan. We oppose United States intervention in Nicaragua and the financing and arming of the Contra terrorists.  Labour will actively seek a stable peace in the Middle East which protects the security of Israel and recognises the right of Palestinians to self-determination.  Labour supports genuine guarantees for the independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of Cyprus and supports the efforts of the United Nations to achieve that.  We support the human rights movement throughout the world. We champion the demand for free trade unions in Poland. We will press the Russians to honour their obligations under INTERNATIONAL HUMAN RIGHTS agreements.  International terrorism is a growing menace to liberty and security. Labour is firmly committed to strengthening national provision and international co-operation in combating and defeating it.  Labour's aim is to work constructively with our EEC partners to promote economic expansion and combat unemployment. However, we will stand up for British interests within the European Community and will seek to put an end to the abuses and scandals of the Common Agricultural Policy. We shall, like other member countries, reject EEC interference with our policy for national recovery and renewal.  DEFENDING OUR COUNTRY  Labour has a proud record of acting in defence of Britain. It was a Labour government which helped to establish the North Atlantic Alliance. It was a Labour government which in the 1970s put resources into rebuilding the Royal Navy and equipping the Royal Air Force with the most up-to-date aircraft.  At the same time, Labour has always linked necessary defence with the need to reduce hostility between East and West. We must be alert in protecting our country and equally alert in helping to keep away the scourge of war and nuclear destruction.  The incoming Labour government will maintain that record of effective defence whilst working to lower international tension, fear and distrust.  Labour's defence policy is based squarely and firmly on BRITAIN'S MEMBERSHIP OF NATO. We are determined to make the most useful possible contribution to the alliance. We can best do that by concentrating our resources on the non-nuclear needs of our army, navy and air force.  The Polaris system of nuclear delivery is ageing and will soon be obsolete. The Tories are buying the expensive American Trident system - a policy which increases nuclear armament without increasing security and, at the same time, diminishes our effective defences. Trident's cost of up to £10 billion will take up so much of our defence budget as to deny modern and necessary equipment to our front line forces. Indeed, this process is already happening.  Labour rejects this dishonest and expensive policy. We say that it is time to end the nuclear pretence and to ensure a rational conventional defence policy for Britain.  So Labour will decommission the obsolescent Polaris system. We will cancel Trident and use the money saved to pay for those IMPROVEMENTS FOR OUR ARMY, NAVY AND AIRFORCE which are vital for the defence of our country and to fulfil our role in NATO. We will maintain a 50-frigate and destroyer navy. We will play a full part in the development of the European Fighter Aircraft. We will invest in the best up-to-date equipment for the British Army of the Rhine.  That COMMITMENT TO CONVENTIONAL DEFENCE will be based wherever possible on buying British-made rather than foreign equipment. This policy will provide greater security for workers in our vital industries like aerospace, shipbuilding and engineering where jobs are in danger from the reductions which the Tories are making in conventional defence.  We have always recognised that a PROPERLY NEGOTIATED AND MONITORED INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENT TO REMOVE NUCLEAR WEAPONS from European soil would provide the most effective guarantee against the horrors of nuclear war. It would be the most significant step towards an eventual worldwide renunciation of, and ban upon, nuclear weapons. That is why we were the first to propose to the superpowers the zero option in respect of intermediate nuclear weapons.  Labour therefore strongly supports the talks between the United States and Soviet governments aimed at reducing nuclear armaments. Success in these efforts to negotiate the removal of all intermediate nuclear missiles in Europe would be warmly welcomed. It would mean the removal of America's Cruise missiles here in Britain and in the rest of Europe, as well as Pershing IIs in Germany and the Soviet SS20s and other shorter-range missiles.  We naturally, therefore, want to assist that process in every way possible. If, however, it should fail we shall, after consultation, inform the Americans that we wish them to remove their cruise missiles and other nuclear weapons from Britain. We would then become the ninth - of the sixteen NATO members - which do not have US nuclear weapons on their territory. This change would, of course, not affect the other US, British and joint defence and early warning systems in the United Kingdom.  We will oppose the extension of the arms race into outer space and will seek an international agreement to abolish chemical weapons.  THE WAR WE MUST FIGHT  The world is aware, as never before, of the horrors of famine and poverty in many countries. A Labour Britain will play its full part in defeating these scourges.  We will set up a Department of Overseas Development and Co-operation, headed by a Cabinet Minister. We will DOUBLE BRITAIN'S AID BUDGET in order to achieve the United Nations' target of 0.7 per cent of national income within five years. We will restore funding for development education. We will give greater support to voluntary agencies. We will promote international action to lift the burden of Third World debt and improve the trading conditions of the developing countries.  In all of our policies for making our aid commitment more effective we shall consult the agencies and the men and women of the communities that use the aid to help to win their freedom from want and poverty.  BRITAIN WILL WIN WITH LABOUR  On June 11, the people of Britain have the opportunity to put behind them the bleak years of Thatcherism and to give our country a fresh start Labour's plans, carefully costed, prudently programmed, can provide that start.  To go on under Toryism is to accept lower expectations and narrower horizons: it is to surrender to national decline and national division.  We must not shackle ourselves or burden our children with that future of failure. Together, we can be successful not just in material and economic terms, though these are vitally important, but also in terms of our sense of purpose, our freedom, independence and confidence.  That success can come only when the nation is restored to strength and unity in their fullest sense.  Labour has the policies to generate efficient production and secure high standards of justice. Labour has the vision and commitment to stimulate the energies, the skills and the will to succeed of the British people.  In our precious democratic tradition, a general election passes power back from Parliament to the people. We urge the people to use their power in their own interests, their families' interests, their country's interests.  Britain will win with Labour.  This version excludes the separate marginal annotations intended to highlight certain proposals. Instead, the relevant section of the main text has been emboldened."
NA,198706,"Britain United: The Time Has Come  FOREWARD: BRITAIN UNITED  The Alliance's vision is of a Britain united, a Britain confident, compassionate and competitive. We know that it is possible to unite our country. We know the British people want greater unity. But we also know the task of drawing Britain together again can only be achieved through political, economic and social reform on a scale not contemplated in our country for over forty years.  At the last election, about a third of the nation's voters didn't even both to turn out.  It's hard to think of a more damning condemnation of politics in this country.  But it's not difficult to understand why so many people feel cynical and uninterested.  Since the last war the Tories and Labour have each had six turns at Government.  Many honourable men and women on both sides have worked hard for the nation but the system has defeated all but a few.  Rigid dogmas, the overriding need for party unity, and indiscriminate three-line whips have all helped to create a climate of conflict and rancour.  Listen to Parliamentary question time and count how many times the Speaker has to call for order. We've had forty years of yah-boo politics and where has it got us?  We live in a country that is patently unfair to many of its citizens. While politicians brandish statistics at each other on TV chat shows, we can all see with our own eyes what is happening to our schools, hospitals and inner cities.  We know there is more crime because our own homes have been broken into, our own neighbours have been mugged, our own children have been offered drugs.  We know that unemployment remains a huge problem because few families haven't been touched by its shadow.  For many, the situation seems hopeless. Unable to contemplate five more years of uncaring government under Mrs Thatcher, they still do not trust the Labour Party.  Mr Kinnock tries hard but for how long can he keep the lid on the extremists of the Left?  They already dominate some of the Town Halls When the election is over, will they emerge again to claim the rewards of their silence?  Many of these people feel that the Alliance is the answer - but they ask what chance does it have of changing things? The answer is - every chance.  At the last election, the Alliance won nearly 8 million votes, little less than the Labour Party.  If just 72 more people in every 700 vote for the Alliance this time, we will be the single largest party in Parliament. If just 5 more people in every 700 support us, we would have over 70 seats and almost certainly hold the balance of power.  Think of it. Issues would be judged on their merits. We would curb the Tories' divisive policies and stop the destructive antics of the Labour Left.  Politicians would be forced to listen to each other and work together. The two-party, two-class pantomime would finally be over.  It's not an impossible dream. It's closer now than at any time in our history. All you have to do to make it happen is to vote Alliance on June 17th.  DAVID STEEL DAVID OWEN  INTRODUCTION  There has never been an election like this in modern times. All the evidence and all the commentators confirm that it is a three-way contest which the Alliance enters from a position of unprecedented strength and promise. The Official Opposition is falling apart and is now quite unable to present itself as a realistic alternative to a Government which presides over the worst unemployment ever known in the lifetime of those who are of working age. The two-party system has broken down because it is rooted in outdated battles of class and ideology, and provides no outlet for the vast numbers of people who want individual freedom to go hand-in-hand with social justice, who want the state to back industry without trying to take it over, who want power to be given back to communities instead of concentrated in Whitehall and who want a nation which is soundly defended but takes the lead in the quest for negotiated disarmament and a fairer world.  In any Government the policies which have been set out in the election programme can only tell part of the story of how they will behave in office. It is at least as important to know and trust the values and principles for which they stand, and which will guide their response to the new events and new problems with which governments have to deal. These values, we believe, are embodied in this Joint Programme. They are our guide-book for government:  - Governments are there to protect and preserve the freedom of citizens, to whom they should be accountable and open;  - Freedom must extend to all the people, and Governments must therefore widen the opportunities of those whose liberty is limited by lack of employment, education, health care, housing or help in dealing with disability;  - Governments should not try to do what can be better done by individuals, by communities, by voluntary organisations or by private enterprise, but should set about enabling people to help themselves; however governments should be ready to enter into partnership with these organisations to tackle the problems that neither it nor they can solve alone;  - Decisions of Government should be taken democratically at the most local level compatible with effective action;  - Governments should learn to listen to the people to whom they are accountable;  - Governments should exercise the creative leadership to enable society as a whole to match its needs and resources with the work to be done - of which there is an abundance in Britain today;  - Government must challenge and curb all those who threaten individual freedom by the abuse of monopoly power, by the denial of rights or by crime and violence;  - It is the business of Government to act fairly in the pursuit of a united society, not to identify itself solely with any one section of society or region of the country;  - Government should take positive steps to ensure equal opportunities for women - who make up 52% of the population - and for minority groups such as the ethnic communities.  - Government must enable society to take the longer view, setting the right balance between present consumption and future investment and ensuring that economic development is sustainable and environmentally responsible.  These values must also guide foreign policy, where the defence of the nation goes hand-in-hand with the promotion of peace and fairness in a world marked by severe inequality and injustice.  We believe that Government at all levels can be more open, more accountable, more fair and more in tune with the wishes of the people of this country if it is allowed to break free of the two-party system and the old class conflict which that system feeds. Our country and its people deserve better, and here is how we believe it can be done.  BETTER GOVERNMENT  Most of the problems facing our country cannot be solved unless we get better government. That means government which can carry the people with it in its major policies, and it means government which the citizens can call to account. Our system is currently failing in both respects, and it is getting worse. Under our proposals no government will be able to ride roughshod over the rights of its citizens.  First, we insist that the voting system should be reformed so that no minority - which is what Mrs. Thatcher's Party was at the last election - is given an inflated Parliamentary majority. Fewer people voted Conservative at the last election than the one before, yet the system gave the absolute power of a massively increased majority to Mrs. Thatcher, and ensured that the House of Commons could be little more than a talking shop. No wonder Labour leaders join with the present Conservative leadership in wanting to keep the old system - they can see that it offers the only hope of inflicting on the nation policies which the majority of the people reject. The Alliance will introduce community proportional representation, using the well-tried single transferable vote system with constituencies based on local communities. This system also gives the voters the chance to show which candidates they prefer and would increase the opportunities for women to be elected to Parliament, and make the election of representatives of ethnic minorities more likely. We will reform the voting system for local government on a similar basis, which is the real answer to the abuse of power by the Town Hall extremists. Fairly elected local councils can and should be entrusted with important responsibilities because they are not run as one party states. We will end the scandal whereby England, Scotland and Wales are denied fair representation in the European Parliament; we will introduce a new Great Reform Charter covering a range of specific legislation, all aimed at strengthening our democracy both locally and nationally.  We will open the doors of government so that incompetence and deceit cannot be hidden behind them. We will repeal Section Two of the Official Secrets Act and introduce a Freedom of Information Act so that the public have access to government information to give people access to their personal files, including medical files, held about them by public bodies and to build on the foundation laid by the Access to Personal Files Act, which was introduced as a private members bill by a Liberal MP. We hope to strengthen data protection laws. In areas of government where secrecy is needed, we will introduce new safeguards including a committee of Privy Counsellors to oversee the security services.  We do not believe that Whitehall knows best. British government has never been more centralised than it has become under Mrs. Thatcher. In education, health and every aspect of local government, power has been taken over by Ministers. As a result of what the Conservatives have done, an extremist government would have far more opportunities than ever before to control people's lives. This centralisation is inefficient as well as dangerous. How on earth can the man or woman in Whitehall know the needs, the problems and the potential of every community from Shetland to the Scillies? The Alliance will reverse this trend.  We will introduce a code for the public service and reassert the safeguards of ministerial responsibility and civil service impartiality which have been severely eroded under Mrs. Thatcher's Government as the handling of the Westland affair showed.  We will devolve power to the nations and regions of Britain. We aim to establish an elected Scottish Parliament, Welsh Senedd and elected regional assemblies throughout England. Public support is essential for progress to be made within the framework of an initial Devolution Act. The devolved structure will require a step-by-step process starting with establishing a Scottish Legislative Assembly with wide powers and self-government in her domestic affairs. This would be created within an overall framework in a devolution bill which sets out the objectives and principles for devolution of powers within the UK. Wales already has a well established, but unaccountable, layer of devolved administration; we therefore aim to create a Welsh Senedd and would publish an early Green Paper on its powers and responsibilities. The abolition of the Greater London Council and the six metropolitan county councils has created a vacuum. London is now the only major capital city in the democratic world without a democratically elected local authority. Greater London is of sufficient size and importance to be a region in itself and there is already widespread support for such a regional assembly, which should be established as soon as possible. We shall publish an early Green Paper with proposals for an elected Greater London regional assembly and setting out the proposals, as the need and demand is established, for the creation of democratically elected regional governments in England.  Local government needs a fair system of local finance which the rates no longer provide. The Government's alternative of a poll tax is unacceptable because it is grossly unfair: it does not relate taxation to the ability to pay. We are committed to the planned introduction of a local income tax as the main source of local government revenue in place of domestic rates. We believe that business rates should be related to ability to pay and we will consult with industry and commerce as to how this can be achieved.  Parliament itself needs a shake-up. A fair electoral system will have that effect but even under the present system many existing Parliamentary practices will not survive for long after this election, because three major political forces will be strongly represented. It will no longer be possible for two political parties to run the House of Commons to suit their own convenience. We intend to put the control of parliamentary time in the hands of an All-Party Business Committee and to make much more use of select committees: we want widely-supported private members bills to have sufficient time to be debated and decided upon. In recent years the House of Lords has proved the value of a second chamber by its careful scrutiny of bills which got little attention in the Commons and by its willingness to defeat the government on issues of national concern. But there can be no justification for basing the membership of the second chamber so largely on heredity and on the whim of Prime Ministers. The Alliance will work towards a reform of the second chamber linked with our devolution proposals so that it will include members elected from the regions and nations of Britain and will phase out the rights of hereditary peers to vote in the Lords.  We will greatly strengthen the rights of the individual. British Governments have sought to lull citizens into a false sense of security by claiming that our rights are protected by an unwritten constitution. Hundreds of British people find out every year that these protections are inadequate and they have to go to Strasbourg to seek protection from the European Convention on Human Rights. We will enact the European Convention into British law, so that the citizen can secure redress in the British courts.  We will establish a Human Rights Commission, which will take over the work of the Equal Opportunities and Racial Equality Commissions, and counter all discrimination on grounds of race, sex, creed, class, disability or sexual orientation. The Commission would be able to initiate action in the courts.  We will open up opportunities for women at work and in public life. Today, fewer than one in five of Government appointees on public bodies are women. We will secure equal representation of women on all appointed public bodies within a decade; our social and tax policies aim to give women equal rights and freedom to choose their way of life.  The Alliance accepts the need for immigration controls and for clear legal definition of British nationality, but also accepts that the law in this area is fundamental to individual rights and should be fair to everyone regardless of race and regardless of whether they are men or women. There should be effective rights of appeal against refusal of citizenship and referral to an independent body in cases of deportation, and immigration procedures should be revised so as to promote family unity without significantly affecting immigration totals, which remain lower than rates of emigration from Britain.  We will combat discrimination against black people in housing and employment and take positive steps through such measures as contract compliance to secure equal opportunities for racial minorities, and we will devote more police resources to dealing with racial harassment.  We will combat prejudice against and misunderstanding of people with disabilities, to improve their quality of life, and to extend educational opportunities for disabled young people.  We will restore the principle that anyone born in Britain is entitled to British citizenship. We are adamantly opposed to discrimination and we will repeal the sexist and racist aspects of the British Nationality Act 1981.  The Great Reform Charter  Democracy in Britain did not just happen. It was the product of reform - reform against vested interests of both left and right. In 1832 Britain took the first step with the Great Reform Act. Further instalments of reform followed in 1867, 1884, 1918 and 1928 before all men and women had gained the vote. Yet, since then, our democracy has stood still despite the tremendous changes in the economy and society. The Alliance believes that it is time for a new era of reform. For, without getting the structure of our democracy right, we will get nothing right.  The Alliance, if empowered by the British people, will:  - Replace the undemocratic 'first past the post' electoral system with proportional representation based on a single transferable vote for all Westminster and local authority elections;  - Introduce PR for elections to the European Parliament. We support a common system for all member states;  - Repeal the Official Secrets Act and replace it with Freedom of Information legislation providing for a public right of access to all official information, subject to limited and specific exemptions to protect national security and proper law enforcement and privacy;  - Reform the law of confidentiality to ensure that freedom of expression on matters of public interest is not unnecessarily restricted;  - Incorporate the European Convention on Human Rights and its protocols into British law in a Bill of Rights;  - Remove the right of the Prime Minister to determine the date of general elections and replace it with fixed-term parliaments;  - Devolve power to a legislative Scottish Assembly, establish a Welsh Senedd and decentralise decision-making to the English regions in accordance with the wishes of their electors;  - Extensively reform Whitehall procedures in order to make the governmental system more responsive to the wishes and needs of the people;  - Reform the House of Commons procedures;  - Reform the House of Lords.  Opportunities for Women  The Alliance is committed to the principle that women should have equal opportunities and in government we will take positive steps to ensure this ideal becomes a reality.  We will open up opportunities for women in public life by securing equal representation of women on all appointed bodies within a decade.  We will strengthen the rights of women at work through equal pay for work of equal value, equal treatment, ensuring that all public authorities and private contractors are equal opportunity employers. We will restore the maternity grant and improve benefits for families.  We will offer a tax allowance to help with the costs of childcare and remove the tax on the use of workplace nurseries.  We will ensure that girls and women have equal opportunities in education and training.  We will promote measures that give employees with family responsibilities rights to parental and family leave.  The Alliance wants to see more women in Westminster. Changing the electoral system to a form of proportional representation will increase the opportunities for women to be elected to Parliament.  Northern Ireland  We intend to secure progress towards a peaceful and secure life for the people of Northern Ireland. That depends on the acceptance of three fundamental principles:  - Rejection of violence;  - Recognition that both Unionist and Nationalist traditions have their legitimate place;  - Acceptance that Northern Ireland should not cease to be a part of the UK unless a majority of the people of Northern Ireland so wish.  The government of Northern Ireland must be based on a partnership between the two traditions. The Alliance welcomes the Anglo-Irish agreement as a genuine attempt to achieve the objectives we set out. We wish to see a UK/Irish Parliamentary Council, and a devolved assembly where responsibilities and power will be shared. We would improve arrangements far considering Northern Ireland legislation at Westminster.  Our commitment to incorporate the European Convention on Human Rights into UK law will strengthen individual rights in Northern Ireland and we would reform the Diplock courts so that three judges preside over non-jury trials; in this and other respects we believe that the passing of identical anti-terrorist measures in Northern Ireland and the Republic can increase the authority those measures carry in a divided community. We also support the establishment of a joint security commission.  We would encourage the participation of people from the minority tradition in the RUC and believe that a totally independent police complaints procedure should be established. We would introduce the 110-day limit on the time in which a prisoner may be held in custody before appearing in court, as we propose for England and Wales.  We would encourage those who are working for reconciliation in Northern Ireland and who are seeking to eliminate sectarianism and discrimination in religious life, education, housing and politics.  We believe that the membership of the EEC offers not only practical help to Northern Ireland, but also prospects for the long-term development of a confederal relationship between UK and the Republic of Ireland which could offer a solution to a problem which has claimed over 2,500 lives in the last 18 years.  FIGHTING CRIME  Crime rates have soared in this Government's last eight years. Overall, crime is up by over 60%, burglaries have almost doubled, while robberies have increased two and a half times over. People, particularly elderly people, live in fear in their homes and in the streets and women feel increasingly unable to go out at night.  Detection rates have dropped from over two-fifths in 1979 to under a third in 1986. Increases in police numbers have been largely offset by special duties like policing strikes and demonstrations, and by a drop in the working week. There are few extra bobbies on the beat.  The Alliance would tackle both crime and the causes of crime. Some Labour-controlled boroughs refuse to co-operate with the police in combating crime. The Conservative Government refuses to recognise that homelessness, unemployment and aimless bed-and-breakfast regimes are breeding-grounds of delinquency. Both are wrong.  The Police  The Alliance firmly supports the police in the battle against crime; that light can only be effective if the police get the support of the whole community, through community policing and policemen on the beat. Many police forces are still under strength: yet more officers are needed to provide the kind of local policing which we believe is essential. An Alliance Government will finance a further 4,000 police officers over and above the present Government plans and 1,000 more civilians, so releasing police officers for patrol duties.  Proportional representation for local government would stop unrepresentative extremists from controlling police authorities. It would mean more sensible police authorities and make possible a democratically accountable police authority for London. We oppose the police monitoring units by which some Labour councils attempt to undermine the police. The Alliance fully accepts the need for chief officers to have full operational control of their force. The Alliance supports a fully independent system for investigating complaints against the police. We reject moves towards a national police force. We would appoint a Royal Commission to review the question of police accountability.  Upholding the Law  We will create a new Ministry of Justice. Its responsibilities will include the strengthening of the rights of the citizen to legal aid and advice and improving court and tribunal procedures. We will establish a family court system and set up a new legal services council.  Sentencing Policy. Sentencing is often seen as arbitrary, with the same crime attracting widely divergent punishments. For the criminals, sentences become more of a lottery than a deterring force. We will strengthen the role of the Judicial Studies Board in setting guidelines for sentencing. This will mean that any judge stepping outside the Board's recommendations would be asked to explain the reason and any special circumstances. This would maintain a judge's flexibility, while keeping sentencing broadly consistent. It would also limit the ever-increasing upward trend in sentencing.  A Royal Commission on the Presentation of Violence in the Media. We will establish a Royal Commission to report within a year on the public presentation of violence on TV and the reporting of crime in newspapers, to make recommendations on the possible link between these and violent crime on the streets.  Crime Prevention Units. There would be a duty on all local authorities to establish Crime Prevention Units, and to work closely with the police to help in setting up Neighbourhood Watch schemes. They would advise on security in all new planning and building.  Insuring Against Crime. We aim to make insurance available to all council tenants, who are twice as likely to be burgled as home owners and far less likely to be insured.  Curbing the Sale of Offensive Weapons. We will curb the sale of knuckle dusters, battle knives, spiked shoe straps, cross-bows and catapults.  Lifeline  Too many elderly people suffer from isolation, fear and cold.  We intend to give them the safety, security and warmth they deserve. Britain has 6 million people aged 70 or over. For them our ""Lifeline"" programme will:-  - include free installation of a telephone;  - protect them against the criminal by free installation of secure locks:  - cut their heating bills by free home insulation;  - abolish standing charges on electricity. gas and telephones;  These 6 million people live in 4.5 million households and this will cost £180 million. ""Lifeline"" will build on present schemes and will also be part of our long-term job guarantee.  Crime Crisis Areas  An Alliance Government will target ""Crime Crisis Areas"", those with the highest rates of crime, for special anti-crime measures. Chief Constables, in consultation with Community/Police Liaison Committees and police authorities, would define these areas. They will have:-  - More police on the streets;  - Local police stations re-opened. Police Posts should be established where no station is close by;  - Security grants to pay for entry phones and security locks;  - Projects to make crime danger spots safe and to provide effective street lighting and more caretakers on estates;  - New housing estates designed to minimise opportunities for crime, and hazardous public areas will be redesigned;  - A legal obligation imposed on British Telecom to keep all public telephones in constant repair. In London up to half our public telephones are broken at any one time - many of them the only lifeline in high crime areas.  DEALING WITH OFFENDERS  The Prison Scandal  The prisons are bursting at the seams, yet Home Office projections show numbers increasing until the end of the decade 1985-1995. Of the 13,000 increase, 5,000 people will be untried and unsentenced.  The Alliance believes drastic action is needed to reduce the prison population, while ensuring that those responsible for violent and serious crime are kept out of society for as long as the Courts think necessary. Imprisonment rarely rehabilitates the prisoner. Three-fifths of all men who receive a prison sentence re-offend within two years of being released.  The minimum standards for prisons proposed by NACRO, and accepted in principle by the then Home Secretary as long ago as 1981, should be adopted as a target to be achieved within two years.  A limit of 110 days should be laid down as soon as possible for remand prisoners. If not prosecuted within that period, they would be released. This system operates successfully in Scotland.  Probation authorities should be required to provide bail hostels adequate to accommodate their own needs. The Home Office should make a special 100% grant for the purpose.  The 'short, sharp, shock' has failed. As the Magistrate's Association has recommended there should be a single youth custody sentence. Detention centres, already under-used by the Courts, should be abolished, and the accommodation released to be used for remand centres.  Alternatives to Prison  Every effort should be made to ensure that fine defaulters, elderly shoplifters and drunks are not sent to prison.  Police cautions and intermediate treatment should be more widely used. Where punishment is appropriate, it should normally be community service rather than prison; but many of these offenders are more appropriately dealt with by rehabilitation or medical treatment.  The probation service must be expanded to enable bail and non custodial sentences to be supervised where necessary under appropriate supervision.  The Home Office should consider extending the period of automatic remission for less serious offences.  We strongly support victim support schemes.  Offenders should recompense their victims, either directly or indirectly. Community service orders oblige offenders to undertake work for the community. They should be more widely used.  These changes should ease the frustration that threatens to erupt in the prisons, and enable prison officers to do the professional job they want to do. We welcome 'Fresh Start', which proposes shorter hours and less reliance on overtime, but recognise that unless overcrowding is tackled, this reform may not work.  BUILDING THE FUTURE  A generation ago, Britain was among Europe's richest countries. Today Britain is falling down the league of industrialised nations. Real income per head is well below that of Sweden, Germany or France. Our manufacturing trade has gone into the red. In every year since 1983 we have imported more goods than we exported, the first time that has happened since the Industrial Revolution.  Worst of all is unemployment. Many more than the three million people registered as unemployed have no jobs. The Government has juggled the figures and brought in cosmetic devices to hide the truth. But the facts won't go away. The dole queue is three times what it was in 1979. Unemployment has been a low priority for this Government, used to keep down inflation. Tax cuts have had a higher priority than job creation. The cost in human misery and hardship, loss of confidence and self-respect, not least among young people. has been incalculable.  Britain, like other industrial countries, has to cross the gulf between the first industrial revolution, based on steel, engineering and railways, and the second, based on the sunrise technologies of micro-electronics, bio-technology and new materials. To cross that gulf demands investment in new buildings, plant and machinery, and above all n the research and development on which new products and new processes are based. Yet under Mrs. Thatcher's Government, investment in manufacturing industry and in R & D has fallen substantially. We must give a much higher priority to training and education. There has been a huge decline in apprenticeships and skill training in Britain in the last eight years, although the new technologies demand much higher qualifications and regular updating of knowledge.  The Government has failed to use the once-in-a-lifetime opportunity North Sea oil gave us to invest in our industry and in our people. High interest rates have crippled businesses of all sizes; sudden ups and downs in the sterling exchange rate have handicapped exports. Even the proceeds from selling-off state assets - our assets - have gone into cutting taxes to buy votes.  These are our objectives:  - to reduce unemployment, first amongst those unemployed for a year or more, and amongst young people; in three years we will reduce unemployment by one million;  - to bridge the gap between the older industrial areas and the areas of prosperity. The older industrial areas have lost a million jobs. We would encourage regional development agencies and local employment initiatives to harness the energy and enthusiasm of the local people in these hard-hit areas. The South-East would benefit too, for house prices are now snaring far beyond the ability of most families to pay, and attractive countryside is besieged by developers;  - to build a new partnership between business and government, to re-equip our factories, tackle the blight of our inner cities, and draw up a strategy for a competitive and successful industry;  - to abolish class division in the workplace by encouraging a single status for white collar and blue collar workers, and creating opportunities for all employees to share in the profits, decisions and ownership of firms;  - to strengthen the rights of women at work including equal pay for work of equal value and equal treatment. We will ensure that all public authorities and private contractors are equal opportunity employers and we will promote changes to enable those with domestic responsibilities to secure access to employment. We would restore maternity grants and give a tax allowance to help with child-care costs. We would remove the tax on the use of workplace nurseries and encourage wider provision of child-care facilities.  UNEMPLOYMENT  Unemployment at present levels is not the inevitable result of new technology or world recession - Japan has only 2.5% unemployment and US unemployment has fallen by two million since 1983. It can be reduced in Britain. The key is to ensure that in creating new jobs the nation does not embark on another round of severe inflation which will damage competitiveness and cost us jobs in the long run. Labour ignores this danger and the Conservatives use it as an excuse for allowing unemployment to remain high. The Alliance is prepared to take the difficult steps necessary to create jobs and control inflation at the same time.  Therefore we will expand the economy by targeting resources to increase output and exports rather than consumption and imports. New capital investment building up to £1.5 billion per annum will support the framework of services on which industry and society depend, like transport, homes, schools, hospitals and drainage. We will give more spending power to the poorest people in our society, which will itself generate more economic activity with much less impact on imports than general cuts in income tax;  We will control inflation by winning the support of the British people for our incomes strategy; as a back-up we will legislate for reserve powers for a counter-inflation tax on companies under which inflationary increases would be unattractive because they would go in extra tax: profit-sharing would be exempted. We would introduce fairer arrangements for public sector pay, with an independent pay and information board whose findings would inform and assist negotiations, arbitration procedures and incentives to negotiate no-strike agreements in essential services;  We will join the exchange rate mechanism of the European Monetary System, enabling us to make our currency more stable and to reduce current interest rates by as much as 2%. We would also seek to develop the role of the EMS within the world economy.  For the long-term unemployed we will provide a guarantee of a job through:  - a) a building and investment programme aimed at providing 200,000 jobs in such essential areas as transport, housing, insulation, urban renewal and new technologies;  - b) a new recruitment incentive to encourage companies to take on over 270,000 jobless people;  - c) a crash programme of education and training, offering new skills to the unskilled unemployed, with 200,000 places;  - d) 60,000 extra jobs in the health and social services to improve care in the community and more jobs in nursery education;  - e) an expanded job release scheme, opening up 30,000 jobs by allowing men to benefit from the scheme at 62 years of age.  REBUILDING BRITISH INDUSTRY  Manufacturing and services go hand in hand, but only a quarter of services are tradable and two thirds of our exports depend on manufacturing. Britain cannot survive on a basis of low-tech service jobs. Nor can business flourish without a thriving industry to buy their products. Manufacturing industry is the driving force at the core of our economy. Its decline must be reversed.  Therefore:  - We will introduce Industrial Investment Bonds to attract investors into industry, a new industrial credit scheme to provide medium-term finance for manufacturing companies and a tax allowance for investment in new technologies;  - We will work in partnership with industry and put industry first. There will be a new Cabinet Industrial Policy Committee responsible for overseeing the development and implementation, in co-operation with industry, of a broad industrial strategy with long-term priorities;  - We will encourage employers to take on more staff by a 25% cut in their National Insurance Contribution payments targeted on assisted areas and areas of high unemployment;  - We will introduce a training incentive with rebates for companies who spend more money on training and contributions from those who do not provide it themselves; our new Department of Education and Training will monitor standards and turn youth training into a fully comprehensive, high quality vocational and educational programme for 16-19 years old;  - We will increase the lamentably low funding of civil research and development, placing emphasis both on commercial exploitation of new technology using the British Technology Group, and on boosting basic scientific research; we would give greater support to European Community joint research programmes;  - We will give more backing to exports using the Export Credit Guarantee Department and the Aid and Trade Provision (funded from the DTI) more effectively than the present Government has done in recent years because of its ambivalent attitude towards public sector support. We will press the European Community to take stern action against dumping. We will launch a more determined attack on unfair restrictions on our trade, including those imposed by Japan on a wide range of products and services and by the US on our high-technology exports;  - We will insist on a strong competition policy to promote efficiency and give consumers a fair deal: the Office of Fair Trading will be strengthened and will take on the responsibilities of the Monopolies and Mergers Commission and companies seeking mergers will have to justify them; individuals and institutions will have power to seek redress in court against anti-competitive practices;  - We will continue to judge whether industries should be in the public or private sector on objective criteria related to competition and efficiency. We opposed the privatisation of British Gas and British Telecom although we would not reverse it but instead concentrate on improving consumer choice and protection. We supported the privatisation of Rolls Royce. We would not privatise water authorities and the Central Electricity Generating Board on grounds of public policy relating to safety standards and care for the environment. We welcome the fact that British Steel is now operating profitably. We believe it should be retained as a single entity to withstand international competition and should be considered for privatisation providing its success can be maintained;  - We will work with the people of the hard-hit regions to stimulate new economic activity and new prospects for jobs through regional development agencies. We will encourage the setting up of a local venture capital funds to finance new enterprise. We do not believe that government always knows best, so we will support local initiatives through appropriate fiscal and financial means.  Backing Small Business  We will build a partnership between government, entrepreneurs and investors to encourage new businesses and create new jobs. We will especially encourage small businesses, which will be a major motor of growth and employment in the 1990s.  We will reduce the tax and administrative burdens on small businesses.  We will promote the establishment of Small Firms Investment Companies to provide equity and loan finance.  We will introduce a Bill to enable business to charge interest on overdue payment of bills, if they so wish.  We will ensure that there are business start-up schemes and expansion schemes specifically geared to encouraging enterprise by women.  We will ensure small businesses get their fair share of public contracts from both central and local government.  We will encourage local public/private initiatives, such as the Enterprise Agencies, which we identified in our Worksearch Campaign.  Industrial Investment Bonds  We will introduce Industrial Investment Bonds to liberate many new and small businesses from the high cost of borrowing start-up capital.  These bonds will help bridge the gap between the new businessman who needs access to low-cost funds and the investor, including individuals, who would like to back him or her provided the balance between risk and reward is reasonable. We will accordingly allow new and growing companies to raise funds through the issue of Industrial Investment Bonds which will pay interest free of tax to investors.  A similar scheme is already providing a valuable kick-start for many new companies in the United States. Together with the Business Expansion Scheme, our Industrial Investment Bonds will give the next generation of businesses the most favourable climate ever to build up employment for the community and profits for themselves and their investors.  We Will Promote Partnership  For too long the industrial sector has been a battleground between opposing forces of capital and labour, instead of a mutually beneficial and equal partnership.  We will legislate for employee participation but believe that flexibility must be allowed in working out the detail for employee councils at the place of work. These councils should have the information and the rights to enable them to contribute to strategic decisions; opportunity must be provided for participation at top level - for example by employee directors or a representative or supervisory council, or by directors elected by shareholders and employees jointly.  We will encourage other forms of industrial participation, including co-operatives in which it is workers who hire capital and management skill; we will establish an Industrial Partnership Agency incorporating the Co-operative Development Agency to take a lead in this field.  We will strengthen the law in relation to Directors' statutory obligation to have regard to the interests of their employees as well as their shareholders; this should include a requirement to consult employees before making a recommendation in response to any take-over bids.  We will extend incentives to employees' share-ownership and profit-sharing which were introduced at Liberal insistence in 1987.  We will encourage wider share ownership by a scheme which gives more people a direct tax incentive to become small investors;  We have long been committed to trade union reform aimed at giving unions back to their members and we have taken the lead n promoting the extension of postal ballots and internal elections and have vigorously opposed pre-entry closed shops. Trades unions are an essential element in the protection of the employees' interests, which is why we would return union recognition to GCHQ members. Our central aim is to make unions democratic and accountable and therefore entitled to positive rights including the right to recognition and the right to strike balanced by the acceptance of their responsibilities to their members, their industries and to the wider community.  To reduce industrial conflict we support a system of referring disputes to independent arbitration prior to any industrial action. We will also encourage the establishment of freely negotiated strike-free agreements especially in the provision of essential public services.  We will take action through equal opportunity and contract compliance policies to eliminate discrimination against ethnic minorities and women.  We will actively promote measures that give employees with family responsibilities minimum rights to parental and family leave.  AGRICULTURE  The Alliance will promote a healthy farming industry. We must arrest the precipitous decline in farm incomes of recent years. Our policies for aligning supply and demand of agricultural produce are designed to secure fair returns for farmers' efforts. Adequate price and income support is required to enable necessary farming adjustments to be made.  We will join the exchange rate mechanism of the European Monetary System to lower interest rates, promote financial stability and prevent unfair discrimination against British farmers through over-valuation of the green pound.  The Alliance will work to reform the CAP; the policy has achieved secure food supplies but has gone on unchecked to produce wasteful and hugely expensive surpluses. Many farmers who borrowed heavily on inflated land prices to meet production demands are now threatened with bankruptcy. The Alliance will secure the income of British family farms by negotiating adequate guaranteed prices for determined quantities of production, with additional quantities disposed at much lower floor intervention prices: a two-tier pricing system. An eligible tonnage for each member-state will be agreed to take into account the differing farm structures in the Community.  We will seek a fairer share of milk quota for British producers and the retention of the right to quota transfer and leasing. Transfer of quotas through an agency would create a pool of quota to be administered by the Milk Marketing Board and would help small family farms.  We are committed to supporting the less favoured areas, and ensuring that the upland beef and sheep industries are safeguarded through differential premia and retention of the sheepmeat regime.  We shall increase Government support for effective marketing schemes for farm produce at home and abroad. Farm-based processing and marketing co-operatives will be assisted to retain more of the selling price of foodstuffs in rural communities.  We will encourage conservation, the reduced use of chemical inputs, organic farming and less intensive methods of livestock production. The Government's cuts in agricultural research, education and advice will be reversed. Special efforts will be devoted to lowering input costs. The Alliance will sponsor partnership between Government and industry to promote both research into new uses for farm produce which will help to sustain incomes and into the improvement of animal welfare.  We will encourage farmers to diversify taking account of the needs of tenant farmers and other small family farms. We will make annual payments for the upkeep of important amenities such as walls, hedges, footpaths and meadows. We will provide further support for the custodianship of areas of environmental importance, and the encouragement of mixed forestry on the farm with establishment grants and annual payments for growers. We will propose clear guidelines for land use to assist diversification and to protect the countryside.  The Alliance rejects proposals to rate farm land or buildings. We also reject the Government's proposals for a poll tax which will apply to farmers and farm workers and, unlike Alliance proposals for local government income tax, is not based on the ability to pay.  The Alliance wishes to support new entrants to the farming industry, and therefore proposes the retention of County Council smallholdings and the promotion of tax incentives to encourage landlords to let more land.  We would promote local rural employment, including farm-based tourism, through properly funded rural development agencies and by means of a credit scheme which would provide working capital at low rates of interest to agricultural and rural industries.  We will also encourage the establishment of a Credit Union (or Farm Bank) designed to help farmers secure finance at fair and reasonable rates.  FISHING  The Alliance in government will act to strengthen the contribution the fishing industry can make to the livelihood of rural communities.  After many years of turmoil from the loss of traditional distant water fishing grounds and the protracted negotiations for a fair Common Fishing Policy, what British fishermen now need above all is stability to plan and invest for the future. We will:  - Improve the conservation of fish stocks by the use of licensing and technical means that will safeguard stocks and decentralise the administration of quantitative controls so as to give fishermen greater responsibility for the management of necessary conservation measures with the flexibility to recognise regional differences.  - Strengthen the European Community Inspectorate so as to achieve fair enforcement by all member-states.  - We will support better vocational training, fish processing and marketing and export promotion under the co-ordination of the Seafish Industry Authority.  - We would not impose light dues on fishing vessels.  The Alliance believes that these policies will help to secure jobs, greater prosperity, greater fairness, and a sense of pride in the industries upon which our future depends.  HEALTH AND COMMUNITY CARE  The National Health Service is in a state of fundamental crisis and malaise. It is suffering shortages and declining standards. Our people are seeing their services cut, their waiting lists lengthened, and more and more needs going unmet. Unless a Government is elected again which is committed to the ideas and ideals of a National Health Service, one of the great achievements of 20th century civilised society could be in irreversible decline.  We will back the National Health Service by increasing its budget so that by year five it will be £1 billion per annum higher than that planned by the Conservatives. Our Health Service was once the envy of the world: now the strains under which it is working are well known, and we are losing some of the best health professionals who can no longer do the job they were trained to do because of inadequate resources. We aim to restore a sense of pride in the Health Service and to give it a new sense of direction. Our priorities for change are:  - to provide prompt medical treatment for those who need it, regardless of who they are or where they live. There are huge inequalities between and within regions of the country in availability of hospital treatment and family doctor services. We would set aside special funds - building on the recently introduced funds to cut waiting lists - to back good practice. The Conservative Government has increased prescription charges by 240% over the last eight years which is much higher than inflation. We will not increase prescription charges beyond the inflation rate;  - to promote good health, not merely to treat illness. This means targeting resources in health education, promoting healthy eating, tightening up food labelling and facing up to the problems presented by smoking and alcohol abuse. We will ban advertising of tobacco products. Our policies to deal with unemployment, poverty and poor housing are crucial in reducing ill-health The primary health care team working with family doctors must be built up and their preventive work expanded. There should be more screening, including well-women clinics, with efficient follow-up for known risk groups;  - to create a new innovation fund, to tackle inequalities in health care, improve the ""cinderella services"", and to fund new developments and new priorities in health care; this will have an initial life of five years, with a budget which will total £250 million in the first three years. This will be in addition to money spent on creating new jobs caring in the community;  - to make ""care in the community"" a reality. We are not prepared to see patients turned out of the old institutional hospitals without adequate facilities to care for them in the community. We want to support ""carers"" who look after elderly and handicapped people in their own families and their own homes. We intend to introduce a carers' benefit, and we want carers to have more opportunities for a break from their responsibilities. However, we recognise that for some people good institutional care remains the best solution;  - to strengthen patients' rights, through statutory access for the individual to his or her own medical files, through more opportunities for patients to participate in decisions and through stronger community health councils;  - to give real independence to the Health Education Authority;  - to restructure the nursing profession along the lines proposed in Project 2000.  In the longer term we want to see health authorities brought under democratic control at local level, but the NHS has suffered so many bouts of reorganisation under successive governments that for the moment the priority must be to let those running the service get on with the job.  We would remove the centralising pressure to make all authorities do things in the same way, and we would leave authorities with more freedom to decide, for example, whether privatisation of services was likely to improve patient care or not; we would give these authorities more direct control over their budgets.  We uphold the right of individuals to use their own resources to obtain private medical care, but we will not allow private medicine to exploit the NHS by using facilities at subsidised cost and we will work to end the delays which give rise to ""queue-jumping"" through private medicine.  Right to Treatment  No client of the NHS should have to wait longer than six months for hospital treatment. No-one should be kept waiting for years in pain, with unnecessary crippling disabilities for lack of a hospital bed. Patients should have the right to treatment in other authorities where there is spare capacity.  The Alliance will work to ensure that every patient receives hospital treatment for routine operations within six months of referral by a GP. The backlog of people waiting is now of crisis proportions. We estimate it will take two years to reduce the maximum waiting time to one year. We aim to reduce this to within six months during our first term of office.  To end long waiting lists District Health Authorities and Health Boards will be empowered to:-  - Buy and sell hospital treatment from each other to obtain the best and quickest service;  - Buy services from other Districts with surpluses. Selling services between DHAs would be a new incentive for good management practice rather than penalise success;  - Pay travelling costs for patients who cannot afford transport out of their districts;  - Appoint more hospital doctors and negotiate with consultants so that they give priority to their NHS waiting lists rather than on private practice;  - Ensure an increased number of places in local hospitals for convalescence and community care to release beds for acute treatment.  GPs will need to have full computerised information on waiting lists when they make their first referrals. There are already substantial funds within the NHS for computerisation and the Alliance will ensure all GPs can be linked to hospitals nation-wide.  In consultation with the medical profession, we will draw up and regularly review a list of routine operations such as hip replacement for which all patients should expect treatment within our six month target.  In consultation with District Health Authorities, we will agree allocations of extra resources, taking into account the numbers of patients from outside their area that Districts are already treating.  The Vital Role of the Voluntary Sector  In health and in many other fields of service the work of volunteers and voluntary organisations is vital: the Alliance sees no benefit in state monopoly, and welcomes the dedication, innovation and diversity which the voluntary sector can bring. We want a more stable framework for the voluntary organisations making them less dependent on short-term funding which can be misused by local councils and government departments as a means of exerting political control in the voluntary sector. We will:-  - Expand opportunities for individual voluntary effort, giving young people, for example, the chance to volunteer full-time for a year without losing their social security entitlements and by linking existing voluntary groups with new initiatives;  - Ensure that experience gained by volunteers is given proper accreditation to enable those without traditional qualifications to gain access to further and higher education;  - Ensure adequate public core funding to enable voluntary organisations to take full advantage of tax concessions on payroll giving and individual donors;  - Support services which advise voluntary organisations on how to develop their management skills and structures to ensure staff development and better service delivery;  - Support and help to widen the network of Citizens Advice Bureaux, Law Centres and other legal advice services.  ENDING POVERTY  We can and will relieve many thousands of people from the burden of poverty.  Poverty in Britain is getting worse. The Conservatives' taxation and benefit policies have redistributed income from the poor to the rich, from people with dependent children to single people and childless couples, and from one group of the poor to another group of the poor. This is unjust and unacceptable. The Alliance will tackle poverty by targeting much higher benefits to those with the lowest incomes in relation to their needs. We will help families with children. We will improve benefits for the disabled and those caring for elderly and disabled relatives at home.  Our proposals fall into two parts:  - First, we will, over the first two years, improve the incomes of pensioners, families with children, the unemployed, disabled and carers. These improvements will be paid for in part from increasing public expenditure by a net £1.75 billion by the second year. The remainder will be paid for from increased tax revenues and from changes which will make the tax system fairer.  - The second phase of our proposals will be a restructuring of the tax and benefits systems to create one integrated system which will be simpler and fairer.  The Immediate Package  PENSIONERS  We intend to concentrate the bulk of extra spending on helping poorer pensioners with incomes on and just above the state retirement pension. We will increase the basic state retirement pension by £2.30 a week for a single person and £3.65 for a married couple. This will include the forecast update of the pension in 1988. For poorer pensioners we will introduce an additional benefit of £3.70 a week for single people and £5.75 for couples. This will increase the incomes of poorer pensioners in total by £6 per week (single person) and £9.40 per week (couple).  We will introduce a Death Grant of £400, recoverable from the estate of the deceased, specifically designed to help pensioners with a small amount of savings feel confident that most of their, or their spouse's, funeral costs will be covered by the Grant;  We will require standing charges for gas, electricity and telephones to be abolished for everyone  The £10 Christmas bonus has became hopelessly inadequate to meet the extra spending pensioners and widows face at Christmas.  We will increase the bonus by paying a double pension in the first week of December. A single person will receive £39.50 and a married couple £63.25. The net cost will be £268 million.  CHILD BENEFIT  We will increase child benefit by £1 per child a week in the first year and by a further £1 per child a week in the second year.  MATERNITY GRANT  We will introduce a maternity grant of £150 for the first child born in every family and of £75 for the births of each subsequent child;  FAMILIES IN WORK  We will add £5 per week to the family credit due to be introduced in April 1968 as a replacement to family income supplement. These families will also gain from the extra child benefit. Unlike the Conservatives we will retain at this stage free school meals and milk for family credit recipients regardless of whether the families are in work or not; this will ensure equal treatment with families dependent on benefits.  FAMILIES OUT OF WORK  We will increase the family premium under the income support scheme by £5 per week and, in this first phase, we will increase the net amount per child received by income support families by £2 per child per week;  SINGLE PARENTS  We will increase the single parent premium for income support recipients by £1.10 a week, single parents will also benefit from the increased child benefit and, if their earnings are low, from the extra £5 on family credit. If they are not in paid employment they will benefit from higher family premium and the child additions.  YOUNG PEOPLE  The Conservatives' benefit changes include setting a new low personal allowance for unemployed 18-24 year olds with a higher Personal Allowance for single people 25 and over. We do not support this discrimination based on age and we will abolish the 18-24 income support rate to ensure that all single people receive the same amount of benefit;  LONG-TERM UNEMPLOYED  We will establish a new premium under the income support scheme for the long-term unemployed without dependent children of £3.50 a week for a single person and £5 for a couple;  SOCIAL FUND  We will not place cash limits on the Social Fund and we will replace loans with grants. We will establish clear criteria of eligibility for special payments and a right of independent appeal and will ensure that the very poor receive extra money to cover heating costs;  HOUSING BENEFIT  We will not impose a 20% rates charge on those with very low incomes as the Conservatives plan to do from April 1988. We will not implement the Conservatives' proposed cuts in the funding of Housing Benefit.  The total gross cost of this immediate package over two years is £3.6 billion and the net cost is £1.75 billion, which will be met from our planned expansion of the economy. Part of the cost of the package will be met by changes to the tax system, and by starting to phase in independent taxation for married women.  We will change the current personal tax allowances into a standard allowance worth the same value for all taxpayers and will not uprate the Married Man's Tax Allowance. Pensioners', Single Person's and Wife's Earned Income Allowances will continue to be uprated with inflation. We will confine Mortgage Tax Relief to the basic rate of tax, so that all taxpayers benefit equally from it at the same rate.  PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES  The biggest handicap faced by people with disabilities is the barriers put up by the rest of us to their participation in society. The Alliance therefore supports measures which reduce the physical and attitudinal obstacles faced by those with disabilities and which enable all to enjoy as many as possible of the opportunities which are often taken for granted by the able-bodied.  We believe that the majority of people with disabilities wish to live an independent life in the community and in their own home. In support of this we will:-  - speed up the full implementation of the Disabled Persons Act 1986;  - increase the income of people with disabilities who are dependent on benefits by £3.50 per week and provide additional financial support through our tax and benefit proposals;  - ensure that 'care in the community', policies are properly co-ordinated and funded, unlike the current situation which has been described by the Audit Commission as resulting in ""poor value for money and unnecessary suffering"";  - tackle discrimination against disabled people through our proposed new Bill of Rights and the Human Rights Commission;  - support the voluntary organisations of and for disabled people and ensure that they are properly consulted on matters which affect them;  - ensure that the needs of disabled people are taken into account in housing, public buildings and by public transport operators. We would expand support for the specialised transport which can often be the key to independent living for people with limited mobility;  - improve the provision of education for those with special needs, in colleges as well as fl schools, backed by a National Advisory Committee.  People Caring for Dependent Relatives  We will legislate through the Carers' Charter for carers' needs. We will replace Invalid Care Allowance by a more generous Carers' Benefit.  We will seek to improve the position of people with disabilities in our society.  The Second Stage  The next stage will be to implement our structural changes to the tax and benefit systems. We will replace income support and family credit by a new basic benefit for those in or out of work. Basic benefit entitlement will be gradually reduced as income rises. Child benefit will be payable to all alike, whether they are in or out of work.  We will introduce legislation to merge the tax and benefits systems, and employees' NICs with income tax at a high threshold. These structural changes will not come into effect until the second Parliament.  In the meantime we will continue to freeze the Married Man's Tax Allowance, and this extra revenue will enable us further to improve benefits for families with children, people with disabilities and carers.  Our Longer-Term Objectives  We will reform capital taxation to encourage wider distribution of gifts and legacies;  Wider tax relief for savings, including savings directly invested in small businesses, ending the artificial distinction between income from earning and income from investment;  We would move towards an equal and flexible retirement age for men and women giving everyone the right to retire at any age from 60 to 70, with a reduced pension for those retiring below 65 but protection for women currently approaching retirement at 60;  We will aim to restore the link between pensions and average earnings, broken by the present Government, which will become more feasible if our plans to achieve growth while restraining inflation are given the chance to succeed.  EDUCATION: THE ESSENTIAL INVESTMENT  We will increase investment in education and training by an additional £2 billion per annum beyond that planned by the Conservatives by the fifth year.  Britain lags far behind our main industrial competitors in the proportion of our people who receive higher education, further education and skill training. Basic research is seriously underfunded. As a result, industry lacks the qualified and skilled people it needs, and individuals are not given the chance to develop their potential.  We aim:  - To widen access to education;  - To raise standards in schools;  - To increase research;  - To provide more effective training and skills.  Our schools are in turmoil. The decision of the two largest teachers unions to conduct a series of strikes in protest at the removal of their bargaining rights by the Teachers Pay and Conditions Act, means another term of disrupted education for the children of England and Wales, with especially serious consequences for those taking public examinations this summer. Many of these pupils have suffered repeated disruption of their schooling over the past three years; they are innocent victims of other people's actions.  To continue with the current Government's present policy, which would deny to the teachers negotiating rights for the next three years, cannot create the mutual trust between the teachers, the local education authorities and the Secretary of State that is essential to improved morale in the profession. Without an improvement in morale, pledges of higher standards are in vain; higher standards in the schools can only be achieved by a committed self-respecting teaching profession.  The teachers unions have been divided among themselves on pay and conditions. That is why the Alliance urged earlier this year in the House of Lords that an independent review body should put forward recommendations as a basis for negotiation. That was done by the Main Committee in Scotland; after an agreed settlement, disruption ceased in Scottish schools.  The Alliance believes that the Government should make it clear that teachers pay and conditions would be imposed for the current settlement only; and that an independent review body would be established to make proposals on teachers' pay and conditions as a basis of negotiation. We understand and sympathise with the teachers' anger at the removal of their negotiating rights. We would restore them. But the action by the teachers unions should cease. It does nothing to achieve their aims. It is damaging pupils' education, is alienating public opinion and undermining the standing of teachers in the community. It is in no-one's interest that it continues.  Investing in Quality  A national programme for raising educational standards - The Alliance TEN POINT PLAN.  - ENCOURAGING PROGRESS We will require all schools, both maintained and independent, to publish indicators showing progress in academic results related to intake and social factors such as community involvement, truancy, and delinquency.  - SETTING GOALS We will ask each school to set targets for improvement - in the case of maintained schools, in consultation with their local education authority.  - ASSISTING IMPROVEMENT We will institute 'special inspections' of all schools which regularly fall below a certain level in terms of progress achieved.  - REWARDING EXCELLENCE We will institute an annual 'Queen's Award' for schools, to be judged by an independent panel of experts, for outstanding progress, teaching and curriculum innovation and success.  - PROMOTING PROFESSIONALISM We will establish 'teacher fellowships' as one year awards to outstanding teachers.  - SPREADING TECHNOLOGY We will develop Information Technology Centres as resources of technological expertise in collaboration with local colleges, polytechnics and universities and computing.  - ENRICHING EXPERIENCE We will initiate a pilot project of summer schools, targeted on inner city children, to enhance performance across the curriculum; we will approach independent schools to participate and make their facilities available for these summer schools.  - BOOSTING NUMERACY We will inaugurate a national numeracy campaign, backed by advertising and television.  - INVOLVING PARENTS We will launch pilot projects for parental involvement in schools.  - EMPOWERING PARENTS We will establish a 'code of good practice' for local education authorities including:  - Parents having a voice on education committees;  - LEAs publishing their policies on home/school links;  - LEAs appointing an advisory officer with special responsibility for developing a closer partnership with parents;  - The training of parent governors.  THE ALLIANCE PLANS:  - To create a united Department of Education, Training and Science, and put local education authorities in charge of much of the local training work of the MSC;  - To restore negotiating rights to teachers and to create a General Teaching Council to enhance professional standards, which will also be supported by more in-service training and appraisal to ensure that good teachers do not have to leave the classroom to become administrators n order to achieve adequate rewards and status;  - To raise standards in schools through increased resources for books and materials, doubling teacher training in shortage subjects such as maths, science and computing, through special funds for innovation, through a stronger Inspectorate and through a broad and balanced curriculum established by consensus providing for a core range of subjects to be studied by all pupils but allowing for local needs to be reflected and innovation to be tried.  - To make available one year's pre-school educational experience for all children;  - To develop the potential of each young person by the wider use of profiles and records of achievement, by discouraging early specialisation by reforming the A-level examination so that it covers a wide range of subjects over the arts-science divide, by positive action to encourage girls to take up subjects previously dominated by boys, and by seeking to build on achievements rather than merely penalising failure;  - To enable schools to have full charge of their own budgets, as the Alliance has done in Cambridgeshire, ensuring that a fully representative governing body is accountable for making the most effective use of the available money;  - To get rid of artificial divisions at 16 by taking steps towards a single system of education and training allowances, replacing the present arrangements which make YTS schemes more financially attractive than further study;  - To develop tertiary colleges where local conditions are appropriate;  - A crash programme to overcome skills shortages, with an expansion of training and re-training facilities under the guidance of local education authorities, giving representation to trainees in the management of schemes;  - A training incentive scheme to encourage employers to increase their commitment to training; companies spending above a certain quota on training would receive a rebate;  - To enable the long term unemployed to take up vacant places n further and higher education courses without losing benefit, with the student able to leave the course immediately a job becomes available;  - To widen access to further and higher education by an immediate restoration of benefits taken away by the Tories, plus a 15% phased real improvement in student support.  - To recognise that education is a life-long process, and that more people need to return to it at different stages of life either to learn new skills or to acquire basic skills; we will seek to make access to higher and further education for mature students easier and to strengthen those institutions which are specifically geared to their needs; the European Social Fund should be widened to help in this area;  - To guarantee a period of free further education based on Open University levels of funding for everyone over 1 e to be taken at a time of their choice;  - To restore confidence in our Universities, Polytechnics and Colleges by according proper  - recognition to their value and increasing so far as possible the resources available to them, by expanding scientific research, which has been severely cut, and widening access. We will increase the number of students by 20% over five years as a step towards our goal of doubling the proportion of our young people going in to higher education by the year 2000. The higher education sector would have a major part to play in our crash programme to overcome skill shortages; we intend to create a Higher Education Council to co-ordinate the planning of both sectors of higher education; we support corporate status for Polytechnics but oppose the Government's plans to bring them under national control;  - Improved education provision for those with special needs, in colleges as well as in schools, backed by a National Advisory Committee;  - We recognise and would uphold the rights of those who wish to pay for independent education in the private sector. We would phase out the Assisted Places scheme without affecting pupils already in the scheme, so that money which has been diverted from the state system can once again be used to raise the standards in state schools. We believe that charitable tax reliefs in private education should only go to genuinely philanthropic activities, and would review the workings of charity law with that object in view. We will encourage greater co-operation between state and independent schools.  An Alliance for Young People  The Alliance seeks to give young people the opportunity to shape their own lives and play a full part in their community. Our policies are designed to provide a platform for young people to speak out and to increase their financial independence.  - We will build on the YTS to turn youth training into a fully comprehensive, high quality vocational and educational programme for 16-19 year olds;  - We will offer a job guarantee for our young people who have been unemployed for over a year;  - Our ""Rent-a-Room"" scheme will help satisfy the need, particularly among single, young people, for rented accommodation and will make it easier for them to travel to seek work;  - We will abolish the 18-24 income support rate so that all single people will receive the same rate of personal allowance;  - We will review the duties of local authorities to house the homeless and in the first instance will aim to give 16-18 year olds leaving local authority care, a statutory right to be housed;  - We will get rid of artificial divisions at 16 by taking steps towards a single system of education and training allowances, replacing the present arrangements which discourage young people from continuing in full time education;  - We will restore student benefit entitlements, make a 15% phased real improvement in student support, increase the number of full time equivalent students by 140,000 (20%) in five years and double the number by the end of the century;  - We will reduce the age of candidature to eighteen to enable young people to take a full part in local and central government.  GREEN GROWTH  There cannot be a healthy economy without a healthy environment.  We will take proper care of our environment.  Under an Alliance government every aspect of policy would be examined for its effect on our environment, which we hold in trust for future generations.  We will ensure Britain takes the lead in promoting sustainable economic growth and investment in new technologies designed to remove pollution and thereby create new job opportunities.  The Alliance will set up a new Department of Environmental Protection headed by a Cabinet Minister who will be responsible for environmental management, planning, conservation and pollution control, and promoting environmental policies throughout government. Among the priorities of this department will be:  - Powerful disincentives to polluters based on tougher penalties and implementation of a polluter pays"" principle for cleaning up the damage backed by support for good practice;  - The safest possible containment and disposal for industrial waste, with recycling wherever feasible;  - Clean Air legislation setting new standards, with tough measures to deal with acid rain and an acceleration of the phasing out of lead in petrol;  - Introducing a statutory duty for both private and public sector companies to publish annual statements on the impact of their activities on the environment and of the measures they have taken to prevent, to reduce and eliminate their impact;  - Protection of the green belt round our cities.  The Alliance is opposed to privatisation of the water authorities, which would hand over vital environmental responsibilities affecting rivers, sewerage, water quality, pollution control and fisheries to private hands. These functions should be restored to democratic control.  Energy and the Environment  We will institute an energy policy which meets the needs of industry and the domestic consumer and has full regard to the environment. Britain is in a better position than many other countries to do this because of the natural assets we have. Alliance energy policy avoids dependence on any single source of supply and is based on:  - More prudent use of our oil and gas resources so that they are not depleted too quickly;  - Continued modernisation and development of the coal industry, including new coal-fired power stations with measures to prevent acid rain and more help to areas affected by pit closures; the power to license coal mines would be transferred from British Coal to the Department of Energy to prevent abuse of monopoly;  - Much more research and development work on renewable energy sources, including wind, solar, wave and geothermal energy; we will vigorously pursue proposals for tidal barrages such as those suggested for the Severn and the Mersey, subject to taking the environmental impact into account;  - Far more effort into energy efficiency and conservation, including higher standards of insulation in homes and encouragement of Combined Heat and Power schemes; nevertheless there will need to be a programme of replacement and decommissioning for power stations which are reaching or have reached the end of their design lives.  Existing capacity and planned coal-tired power stations are enough to meet our needs for some time to come and we see no case for proceeding with a PWR at Sizewell or other nuclear power stations at the present time. Safety must come first and after Chernobyl there is clearly a need for a wider investigation into the safety of nuclear power, and there is also a need for a thorough and independent review of the economics of nuclear power generation.  We will continue research into nuclear fission power including research into the fast breeder reactor which may be needed if renewable resources prove to be less viable than we believe. We remain committed to the Joint European Torus (Jet) nuclear fission project.  There is a serious problem concerning the disposal of nuclear waste, and further studies will be commissioned to solve the problem as satisfactorily as possible. We do not believe that this critical matter should be rushed and therefore advocate on-site storage until suitable methods which have proved to be safe are available.  We would abide by the international convention (the London convention) which prohibits marine dumping of nuclear waste.  The environment is under particular stress in two areas: the cities and the countryside. The Alliance is determined to protect and improve the quality of life in both.  Improving the Quality of Life in the Inner Cities  Our cities are in danger of changing from having been centres of initiative and activity in the past into industrial deserts, pessimistic about their future. The division and bitterness in Britain that Conservative neglect in central government and Labour control in local government have brought about are seen at their worst in our major cities.  Urban neighbourhoods need to be no less distinct and individual than rural communities but the Labour and Conservative attitude has been to regard the city and particularly the inner city as one huge problem area and as a battleground for the class struggle. Those who live there know better and are appalled at the damage inflicted on the close, caring communities of the past.  The Alliance believes that the strong city cannot survive without strong neighbourhoods. We have confidence in the ability of those who live in the inner city to renew their own communities, but they must be given the political and economic tools to do the job. Too many of the people who serve the inner cities in professional jobs live in suburbs remote from local problems.  Through a partnership of the public and private sectors we would invest in housing, schools and the infrastructure to encourage those who work in the inner cities to live there.  We will make attractive residential accommodation available and closer to the city centre to end the twilight ghettos that assist the mugger and the burglar.  We will support opportunities for local people to work in their own community, to establish new businesses through local enterprise agencies and to train for needed skills.  The Alliance will use the Urban Programme to establish community centres, enhance voluntary groups and assist tenants to manage their own estates.  We will promote the establishment of elected Neighbourhood Councils with statutory parish status, where there is clear demand.  Genuine law and order depends on communities supporting the police in preventing crime and being confident enough to end the anonymity on which criminal activity thrives.  Renewing our cities and enabling urban communities to develop a real sense of stability and security is the only sound way of preventing and detecting crime.  Protecting and Enhancing Our Countryside  The Alliance seeks to provide better opportunities for those who live and work in the countryside, to check decline and depopulation, (especially of young people), to support small businesses and to encourage self-help solutions to rural problems.  Our agricultural policies are designed to allow farmland to remain in use rather than being set aside. However, our planning strategy will allow for alternative land use which is in keeping with, and makes a sensitive contribution to the local rural economy.  - We will give strong support to the Development Commission and COSIRA, in their efforts to promote local enterprise and to re-use existing buildings for these purposes. In regions where Development Agencies are set up they will promote a co-ordinated approach to the rural economy. Rural areas with severe economic problems should be designated to receive aid from the European Community regional fund;  - We will encourage imaginative schemes to maintain essential facilities in the countryside such as rural transport, village schools, call boxes and sub-post offices, all of which have been threatened under the Conservatives; nationalised industries and privatised monopolies such as British Telecom should be placed under stronger obligations to recognise rural needs;  - We will conserve our heritage of buildings;  - National Parks, areas of outstanding natural beauty and green belts should be fully protected, with those who live and work in these areas having a full, democratic voice in planning policies and recognition given of the added problems they face;  - Forestry policy should place more emphasis on broad-leaved species, and larger scale afforestation should be subject to a special system of planning controls;  - We oppose the privatisation of the Forestry Commission.  BETTER HOUSING  Home Start  Owning a home of one's own is most people's dream but not everyone can afford the high cost of taking the first step. We will open the door to home-ownership for thousands more the young and the not-so-young - to enable them to cope with the initial problem, buying a home, when their resources are most stretched.  We will build on and considerably improve the existing Capital Home Loan Scheme with a tax credit of up to £1,000 for every new buyer. This will give first time buyers the benefit of lower monthly repayments at the start of their mortgages.  All those eligible will have average incomes for the two previous years not exceeding £20,000 (joint) or £10,000 (single). A ceiling will be worked out, region by region, on the price of the home purchased, so as to exclude people rich enough to buy very expensive homes. We estimate this will cost around £50 million per annum once the scheme is fully underway.  We will abolish Stamp Duty on house purchases for everyone participating in ""Home Start"". Stamp Duty now stands at 1% on purchases priced at above £30,000. Abolition would be worth at least £300 and could in the south-east be worth £500 to a first-time buyer.  We will take action to deal with homelessness and bad housing. Housing is a vivid example of the Conservatives' cynicism. The Government decided the narrow rules restricting local housing powers, cut back the capital sums available and is now blaming the local housing authorities for the housing crisis such national decisions cause. In particular the restriction of spending on housing to only 20% of the money coming to local authorities from capital sales makes no financial or social sense. We will remove the restriction.  - We will tackle the problem of homelessness;  - We will give tenants more control over their environment and more choice;  - We will provide more choices for private tenants;  - We will give the elderly and disabled more opportunities to move to more suitable housing or to adapt their present homes;  - We will stop housing problems from restricting economic opportunities - it is no use getting ""on your bike"" to find work if the only available jobs are in places where there is no affordable housing accommodation;  - We will require each housing authority to draw up a housing strategy to determine what are the areas of need and how they can best be met working with voluntary organisation, housing associations, building societies and the private sector, as Alliance groups on local councils are already doing;  - We will open up a new 'partnership' sector of rented housing funded by building societies and institutions with a central government contribution to keep rents at reasonable levels; these schemes would be run by their tenants as co-operatives with the support of local councils and Housing Associations. In the long run we want public support for housing costs to be even-handed between those who rent and those who buy;  - We will target our housing assistance on those who most need it. We will promote mortgage schemes which can open up home ownership to a wider variety of people, such as index-linked mortgages and shared ownership; we will improve the availability of home improvement grants to homeowners to maintain the fabric of their properties for the benefit of the whole community;  - We will retain the right to buy. We also wish to give local authorities enough discretion to deal with local housing shortages. Parliament must ensure that limits are set on such discretion to ensure that it is not used to deny the right to buy to tenants in general, and that anyone who is precluded from buying his or her present home is given the opportunity to buy another property on comparable terms through portable discounts;  - We would restore to councils the right to spend the proceeds of council house sales on replacing and repairing housing stock;  - We will insist on higher design standards in public housing, more and greater recognition of the contribution that good community architecture can make to the quality of life and we want investment directed at improving existing properties wherever justified rather than demolition;  - We will incorporate rights for council tenants to control and improve their houses in a statutory tenants' charter;  - We will set up a national mobility scheme covering all sectors of housing;  - Once more homes are available because of the Alliance's housing strategy, we will extend the statutory duty of local authorities to provide for the homeless, phasing in extensions to the 1977 act beginning with single people over 40 and young aged 16-18 leaving care or who are otherwise homeless.  Rent-A-Room  There is a desperate need for rented accommodation, particularly for single people and couples. There are millions of owner-occupied houses and council houses in Britain with spare rooms.  Many are deterred from renting by the present rentals red tape. Another crucial factor is to make it easier for people to travel to seek work. We will act to enable owner-occupiers and council tenants wishing to let a room in their own home to do so more easily, and to their financial advantage.  Rental income up to £60 per week will not be subject to income tax or capital gains tax.  We will legislate to invalidate clauses in mortgage contracts or local authority letting contracts that prohibit such lettings.  Re-possession of such rooms will be made easier.  The ""Rent-a-Room"" scheme will be restricted to owner-occupier, council tenants, or tenants of housing associations, letting a maximum of two rooms in their home.  The rent will be determined by the market, but only rental income up to a total of £60 per week will be disregarded by the Inland Revenue.  We will legislate to impose a duty on local authorities to issue and regularly review licences to approved agencies, such as housing associations, housing aid centres, or commercial agencies, in their area to operate the scheme. Such agencies will enter into contracts with both landlord and tenant, and will be responsible to the landlord for ending any tenancy arrangement within a fortnight. Court procedures will be speeded up to ensure that possession in all genuine cases is obtainable in that time.  The ""Rent-a-Room"" scheme will benefit many people.  First, it will help single people and couples, particularly the young, and those moving in order to get work to find suitable accommodation, where at the moment it is both scarce and expensive.  Second, it will help owner-occupiers, including elderly people, to increase their income, to assist with mortgage repayments or with the maintenance for their homes; it should help some young families to be able to afford to become home owners for the first time.  Home Income Plan  For many elderly people their only capital is their home and they do not have a regular income. Elderly home owners on low incomes, in fact, are becoming one of the most deprived sections of the community. The proportion in low standard homes is double that of the population as a whole and many others in good homes are short of spending money.  To enable Britain's elderly home owners to live more comfortable, independent and happier lives we will introduce a tax-assisted Home Income Plan. It will significantly increase their income or provide money for essential house expenses and repairs.  The Home Income Plan will enable them, if they choose, to unlock the capital value of their homes to meet their need for more income now  They will be able to take out a mortgage on part of the value of the house and use it to buy an annuity providing regular income. The interest on the loan will be added to the capital sum so that neither interest nor capital need be repaid during the borrower's lifetime.  Although several leading building societies and life assurance companies offer home income plans at present, they are of limited value because the interest has to be paid gross after the death of the borrower. Yet tax relief is allowed if the borrowers reduce their income by repaying the interest during their lifetime. Neither method gives really fair value and so only 25,000 home income plans have been taken out.  We will make Home Income Plans a really worthwhile benefit for older people by allowing them to postpone the interest payments and qualify for tax relief when the interest is finally repaid. This could, on life assurance industry calculations give an 80% boost to the income of a woman in her 70's.  Tax relief for pensioners aged 70 or over who take out Home Income Plans would cost less than £40 million, assuming a 70% take-up. The cost would take time to build up and would not be incurred all at once.  TRANSPORT  We will maintain public transport.  Wider car ownership has improved the quality of life and enhanced the freedom of millions of people, which we welcome; at the same time, transport policy has to deal with the problems of congestion and road safety, which arise from busier roads, and has to ensure adequate public transport for those who do not have access to a car, including many women, young people and the elderly. While so many people have greater freedom of travel than ever before, significant minorities now have significantly less opportunity to travel than previously, especially in rural areas and some outlying housing estates.  The Alliance believes that:  - Deregulation of bus services under the Conservatives was botched. Bus services could only survive if they paid for themselves, leaving many elderly people and single-parent families isolated in their own homes. The Alliance supports comprehensive competitive tendering for a network of necessary bus services, with local councils involved in planning and financing them. This combines greater enterprise and new ideas with more care for deprived groups and areas. Local councils and transport authorities should use their subsidy powers to ensure that essential services are maintained and that public transport in cities is attractive enough to reduce congestion resulting from commuting by car;  - We will undertake a major renewal of road, rail and port infrastructure as part of our programme of measures to tackle unemployment; we will build more by-passes and a designated national heavy lorry network to get more of the vehicles out of the towns, villages and residential areas;  - We will support investment in our rail network both to encourage the transfer of freight from road to rail and to ensure that the nations and regions of Britain all share in the economic advantages of the Channel fixed link.  The Conservative Government has presided over a decline in our merchant fleet which threatens our national economic and security interest. We would entrust the lead role in co-ordinating maritime policy to a senior member of the Cabinet; and we would seek to help the industry through the present crisis by positive financial support and a determination to ensure fair play in world shipping markets.  ARTS, BROADCASTING AND RECREATION  We will ensure that people have the opportunity to enjoy the arts and physical recreation and to develop their own potential through these activities. To help achieve this aim we will double arts funding within the lifetime of one Parliament.  The Alliance will set up a unified Ministry, headed by a Cabinet Minister, to have responsibility for the arts, broadcasting, films, publishing, leisure and recreation - these activities are at present scattered amongst Ministries within which they are of minor significance and are subject to control rather than enhancement;  We will further decentralise funding for the arts, channelling it through enhanced regional arts associations and the Scottish and Welsh Arts Councils;  Wherever possible we will replace grants with endowment trusts providing greater stability and independence for the arts with a mix of public and private funding;  We will co-operate with artists to achieve better deals through stronger copyright and public lending right laws;  We regard the BBC World Service, the British Council and the provision of educational facilities for overseas students as very effective cultural ambassadors and we will ensure that increased funds are available to carry out that task;  We will secure the maximum access to sports facilities for the whole community.  ANIMALS  We will strengthen the protection of animals.  A civilised society treats animals with care and compassion. An Alliance Government will therefore set up an Animal Protection Commission which will considerably improve control over the welfare of animals in laboratories, farms, zoos, slaughter houses and circuses, as well as domestic and wild animals, and at a reduced cost, by unifying all existing Government responsibilities in this field. The Commission will be given extensive powers to advise, inspect and enforce legislation, and to review the effectiveness of existing legislation to deal with cruelty, in particular police entry powers and the power of the courts. The Commission will include fair representation from animal welfare organisations as well as users.  BRITAIN, EUROPE AND THE WORLD  The Alliance will ensure that Britain's foreign and defence policies help to bring a fairer and safer world. The things we want to achieve n our own country will not be possible unless we co-operate with other countries to achieve a fairer and safer world. Our concern that people should have basic human rights and a decent life cannot stop at the Channel. The huge public support for famine relief, the vigorous public debates on peace and defence and the public compassion for those suffering from oppression in many parts of the world refute the narrow-minded view that world affairs are not an election issue in Britain.  Our Aims  The Alliance is firmly internationalist. Opportunities for international co-operation have been thrown away by the Governments of the post-war years, when Britain needed to develop a new role and new relationships in a changed world.  We see the future of the United Kingdom as being bound up with the future of the European Community. As an enthusiastic and committed member of that Community Britain can significantly influence political and economic decisions.  Britain is also a member of the Commonwealth and should be using that position to develop concerted policies on eradicating hunger and on issues such as South Africa and Namibia, yet Mrs. Thatcher has made such agreement impossible and treats respected Commonwealth leaders with disdain.  Britain should take the lead in seeking international agreement on selective, targeted sanctions, backed by help for the Front Line States, as a means of increasing the pressure for an end to apartheid n South Africa.  Britain should have a sufficiently mature relationship with the United States for the British Prime Minister to make clear where British foreign policy departs from that of the President of the day. The British Prime Minister should disavow such ventures as the bombing of Libya and support for the Contras, as so many Americans do, rather than allying with the most conservative forces in the White House.  On defence and disarmament, Britain should be firmly committed to the achievement of multilateral disarmament and firm in our acceptance of our responsibility towards collective security through NATO: the Alliance rejects the one-sided approach which characterises both the escalation of our present nuclear capacity through Trident and Labour's decision to remove all nuclear weapons from British soil without securing the removal of those weapons which could threaten us.  The Alliance believes that Britain should take a lead in seeking international efforts to tackle the basic problems of the poorest countries of the world, particularly the burden of debt which is crippling their efforts to feed their own people and the need to get a fairer system of international trade which is not biased against the poorer countries.  Europe  The European Community must be the basis of a united Europe which has common policies on trade, technology and social policy, and encourages Europe's scientific and industrial development. We believe Labour's negative attitude to the European Community, and the obstructiveness of Mrs. Thatcher's Government, not least in vetoing the proposed European Community programme for co-ordinated research and development, is short-sighted and unconstructive. In a world of super-powers, Europe has to speak with a united voice.  The Alliance would:-  - Ensure fair elections to the European Parliament by proportional representation to give proper rights to the people of this country;  - Seek reform of the Community's political institutions so that the bureaucracy is properly accountable to the European Parliament, and that the Council of Ministers shares power effectively with the Parliament;  - Work for reform of the Common Agricultural Policy so that it no longer dominates the Community budget, and to develop Community policies on regional development, social and employment issues;  - Support European initiatives to put effort and resources into developing advanced technology; we would accept the negotiated European Community co-ordinated research and development programme;  - Make it easier for companies to sell throughout Europe;  - Extend the common rights of citizenship in Europe.  Global Co-operation  An Alliance Government will:  - Increase British support for the United Nations, develop its capacity for peacekeeping, restore Britain's membership of UNESCO and increase British backing for the UN agencies such as the High Commission for Refugees;  - Develop Commonwealth and European co-operation on a wide range of issues, including sanctions against South Africa designed to increase pressure for an end to apartheid and peaceful change before war becomes inevitable; we are also determined to end South Africa's illegal occupation of Namibia;  - Increase efforts through international co-operation to deal with the threat of terrorism.  Peace and Security  We will promote disarmament while maintaining sound defence.  Everything we prize most highly could be threatened by the destruction of our freedom through armed intervention or threat, or by the destruction of a world which now contains a massive arsenal of nuclear weapons. But at long last there is now an opportunity to halt the arms race. The Alliance is determined to combine sound defence against any possible threat with determined efforts to reduce and even remove the massive nuclear stockpile, which causes increasing anxiety to the peoples of the world. New opportunities for arms agreements are being opened up by the changed priorities of a new Soviet leadership: we cannot afford to assume that this new and welcome trend in Moscow will continue unchecked, but at this delicate and hopeful stage it is vital that we have a British Government determined to seize the opportunity to drive sensible bargains on arms control which are secure because they are seen on each side as being realistic. Britain cannot defend itself or the values of western democracy alone, just as it cannot achieve international disarmament solely by its own actions: both the other Parties have chosen in different ways to ignore the reality that our defence and disarmament efforts are interdependent with those of other countries.  The Alliance is committed to NATO, and we accept the obligations of NATO, including the presence of Allied bases and nuclear weapons on British soil on the basis of clear arrangements for a British veto over their operations including where appropriate, dual-key systems; we believe it is essential to strengthen the European contribution to NATO.  The Alliance welcomed the outline agreement discussed at Reykjavik to remove all intermediate nuclear weapons from Europe, and Mr Gorbachev's later acceptance that such a deal should not be linked to the future of the US Strategic Defence Initiative; The Alliance believes that this must be only the first, vital step in a continuing process which will include both shorter-range nuclear weapons and conventional forces.  The Alliance would withdraw UK support for President Reagan's Strategic Defence Initiative, which clearly involves breaching the ABM Treaty, is destabilising and is likely to lead to further escalation.  We will seek to revive negotiations on a Comprehensive Test Ban. In the meantime Britain should itself ban nuclear weapons testing and should encourage the US to do likewise.  We would seek a battlefield-nuclear-weapon-free zone in Central Europe extending 150km in each direction from the East-West divide.  We believe that NATO relies too heavily on nuclear weapons at all levels for deterrence. A strengthened European pillar, involving effective defence co-operation and improved conventional strength would better enable Western Europe to move towards the elimination of dependence on first use of nuclear weapons. NATO should adopt strategies and weapons which are more self-evidently defensive in intent and which are concerned with minimum deterrence.  We want to see a new initiative achieve Mutual and Balanced Force Reductions and we would be prepared to include Britain's nuclear weapons in disarmament negotiations.  We would continue Britain's efforts to achieve a multilateral treaty prohibiting the manufacture, development and possession of chemical weapons. In the meantime, we would oppose any manufacture of fresh stocks of chemical or biological weapons.  In government we would maintain, with whatever necessary modernisation, our minimum nuclear deterrent until it can be negotiated away, as part of a global arms negotiation process, in return for worthwhile concessions by the USSR which would enhance British and European security. In any such modernisation we would maintain our capability in the sense of freezing our capacity at a level no greater than that of the Polaris system. We would cancel Trident because of its excessive number of warheads and megatonnage, high cost and continued dependence on US technology. We would assign our minimum deterrent to NATO and seek every opportunity to improve European co-operation on procurement and strategic questions.  We would seek to reduce the flow of arms to areas of conflict and to ensure that arms from Britain are not supplied to repressive regimes, particularly for their internal security operations.  Shared Earth  The Alliance will:-  - Increase the share of Britain's GNP which goes in development aid, which has gone down from 0.52% to 0.33% under the Conservatives, so that we reach the UN target of 0.7% by the end of a five-year Parliament;  - Concentrate aid on raising the living standards of the poorest through more rural development, environmentally sustainable resource use, promotion of self-sufficiency, recognition of the role of women, appropriate technology, training and education, making full use of experience and expert voluntary agencies;  - Seek to increase awareness of development issues through more resources being devoted to development education;  - Change the situation in which many poor countries pay more in debt repayments to rich countries than they receive in aid by seeking international agreement on debt rescheduling and cancellation;  - Combine the Aid-Trade Provision and the Overseas Development Administration's ""soft-loan"" facility with the Overseas Projects division of the Department of Trade and Industry and the Export Credit Guarantee Department into one division of the DTI - help to British industry will no longer be taken from the aid budget.  CONCLUSION  The Alliance came into being to achieve these things. From three sources came the political ideas and momentum which are now carrying the Alliance forward. One was Liberalism, a long and honoured political tradition from which we draw not only the philosophy of individual freedom but also a record of achievement in the establishment of the modern welfare state and the championing of local communities. The SDP combines a commitment to social justice and ending poverty with a dynamic approach to wealth creation and its leaders have extensive experience of government. A third element, which has ensured that the strength of the Alliance is infinitely greater than the sum of its parts, is the support of those who have never before been members of a political party, because no party seemed to offer them the chance to realise their aims. Their numbers continue to grow.  The Alliance is therefore different. It involves two political parties working together, and taking along with them the great mass of people who are dissatisfied with the politics of recent years, the kind of politics which is so dismally displayed in the shouting match of the House of Commons at Prime Minister's Question Time. All political parties involve compromises between different views and different strands of opinion - the Labour and Conservative parties each embrace an enormously wide range of opinion. But for them the spirit of compromise, if it operates at all, has to be concealed, kept within the party and denied in public. We make no secret of the fact that our programme draws on the ideas of our two parties and that we are keen to work together to achieve shared goals. Like the others we seek to put our entire programme forward for endorsement and to form a majority Alliance Government, but unlike the others the whole approach of the Alliance underlines our belief that if we are in a balanced Parliament we must heed the message of the voters and work with the other parties to seek an agreed programme which commands the widest possible support.  The Alliance is different also because it is not the voice of any one section or interest. It is not paid for and controlled by the trade union movement, as is the Labour party, and it does not have the massive dependence which the Conservatives have on the City and big business. These links make each of the other parties powerless to reform their own institutional backers and incapable of understanding or winning the confidence of their institutional opponents. The Alliance has a capacity to be fair which is based on its independence and on the breadth of its support, typified by the fact that we have been able to win by-elections in the heart of the countryside in a former Conservative stronghold in Ryedale and in a former Labour stronghold in Greenwich, both seats now held by Liberal and SDP women MPs.  The Alliance is different in another respect. It is not merely seeking to become the elected government of the country, but to overhaul the system of government so that all future governments, of whatever party, are based on real public consent and full participation in an open society. Our intention is not simply to get into the driving seat but to re-design the vehicle. Once the Alliance has reformed the voting system, no future government will be awarded the power of a majority without the support of a majority of the people, and no kind of extremism, whether of the left or of the right, will be able to get in through the back door. Not only that - if we find ourselves exercising power in a Parliament with no overall majority, we guarantee that we will use that power to block extremism and to fight for the kind of reforms which make sure that governments cannot push people around and individuals have the opportunity and the means to achieve their full potential.  The Alliance is different too, in its belief about the nature of society. Our aim is a civilised society in which individual freedom goes hand-in-hand with care for others. Individual freedom is central to our beliefs, but if it is not accompanied by social responsibility it becomes freedom only far those who can afford it, or the survival of the fittest. But when society as a whole tries to meet human needs it must respect individual choice and be aware of the dangers and limitations of state provision, otherwise there will be no freedom, and public services will be both inhuman and inefficient. Declining public services and the inhuman scale of organisations like the DHSS and the big council housing departments have contributed to a widespread feeling of apathy and despair, and many young people in particular feel that this society has no place for them and does not want to listen to them. Government must work in partnership with people, enabling them to use their own organisations, their own local communities and their own skills, and giving them effective democratic control over those services which can only be provided by the community as a whole. Our society is one that recognises that the arts are not an optional extra, to be grudgingly afforded when the economy is booming, but play an essential part in meeting the wider needs of individuals and in broadening the vision of communities. Our aim is a society in which values other than the purely economic are recognised and valued. Our society is one that recognises the importance of the environment in which we live - even those who are successful do not want to live in a shoddy society whose values are dominated by greed and selfishness. We recognise the crucial need to live in harmony with our environment and we will support those developments in our industrial and social activities which are environmentally enhancing and benign. We aim to join the nations which lead the field in environmental protection instead of trailing amongst the last,  The Alliance is also different in being concerned about both unemployment and inflation. The Conservative Party concentrates all its attention on inflation and ignores unemployment and its consequences. The Labour Party concentrates all its attention on unemployment and ignores the fact that increased inflation undermines expansion and inevitably puts brakes on efforts to get people back to work. We must have sustainable growth. That is why our proposals for expanding the economy are accompanied by plans for an incomes strategy and for a firm monetary and exchange rate discipline through entry to the exchange rate mechanism of the European Monetary System. But in the long term we will only succeed if we give the top priority to industry. The service and manufacturing sectors of industry are mutually dependent, but manufacturing industry has been devastated in recent years. We believe it is the engine of growth and our competitors in Japan, in Germany and in the US demonstrate that only too well,  Much of what the Alliance wants to do to ensure basic standards in the public services and to encourage people to find new ways of caring for one another depend on achieving success through our economic and industrial policies, which are designed to enable us to achieve greater prosperity. Some of what we want to do will have to wait until we have earned the resources with which to do it. We are not prepared to enter an electoral auction seeing who can make the largest bids to spend money which is not there and will not be there unless taxes and borrowing are increased to unreasonable and imprudent levels. Investment in industry and particularly in new and high technology industry is the key to creating the wealth we all want. We deplore the way in which windfall benefits such as oil revenues and the proceeds from privatisation have been frittered away instead of being used to enhance the basic fabric of our society.  The other parties know that the Alliance is different, and they fear it, even to the extent of burying their own fundamental disagreements with each other so as to co-operate against us. In the House of Commons they have voted together against electoral reform, and against some of the measures designed to put trades unions fully under the control of their members. They work with each other in an attempt to preserve the appearance of a two-party system long after it is dead: Conservatives carefully protect Labour's privileges in the House of Commons to ensure that latterly only Labour and Conservative working peers have been appointed to the Lords, in vain hope of silencing the Alliance voice. We do not rule out the possibility that after the next election there could be an informal ""Lab-Con pact"" to keep the Alliance out, as there has been on several local councils: it would be the old parties way of attempting to stagger on as if nothing had happened after the two-party system had suffered a shattering defeat. Indeed we believe that Labour and Conservative supporters should now be asking their candidates ""In a balanced Parliament will you work with the Alliance or with our traditional opponents?""  That is why our prime aim is an Alliance majority government, an aim that can certainly be realised at this election. Indeed, such are the absurdities of the voting system that quite small increases in Alliance support can make the difference between fifty Alliance seats and three hundred. If we get that majority we will at once set out to reform the system which produced it. Our commitment to fair elections is clear. We are the only political grouping who, if given a majority, would use that majority power forthwith to reform the system under which we gained it. But we will also be able to get on with the job of bringing down unemployment while managing the economy on a sound basis so as to prevent inflation from increasing dramatically again. We will be able to embark on immediate improvements in basic services like education and health, while we open the way to the longer-term proposals in these and other fields which will give people more chance to realise their full potential and build a caring community. We will be able through our tax and benefit proposals to improve the lot of those who now find themselves on or near the poverty line. We will be able to make the conservation of the environment a priority of government, and pay special attention to the needs of cities and countryside. We will be able to house many of the homeless through more imaginative housing policies involving partnership between public and private housing. We will pursue policies on defence and foreign affairs which will make Britain a force for good in the world, recognising our interdependence with other nations.  All this is possible, and our Joint Programme sets out the main steps we will take. These aims and values are also a clear guide to the way we would use the power we had if no party had an overall majority. We would insist that the views of the substantial section of the electorate who had voted for us went into the process by which the programme of a new government was decided. If other parties seek to cheat the electorate of that right, we shall seek to bring the matter back before the voters as soon as possible. We are not prepared to see the views of so many voters ignored any longer.  Alongside this Programme for Government the Alliance is publishing manifestos for Scotland and Wales, setting out our policies on those issues which we believe should be dealt with by devolved power.  An Election of Opportunity  We believe that our priorities are right, that our proposals are practical and that our values are those which are most urgently needed in the government of this country. We make no claim to have a monopoly on good ideas. We seek from the voters the chance to give back to them the power and the opportunities which are rightly theirs. Their time has come."
"Conservatives",198706,"The Next Moves Forward  FOREWORD  In the last eight years our country has changed - changed for the better.  We have discovered a new strength and a new pride. We have fostered a new spirit of enterprise. We have risen to fresh challenges at home and abroad. Once again our economy is strong. Our industries are flourishing. Unemployment is falling.  Founded on this new prosperity, we are building a better Health Service and providing more care for those in need. Living standards are higher than ever before. Our people have the protection of a stronger defence and more police.  Britain has come right by her own efforts. We trusted in the character and talents of our people. The British instinct is for choice and independence. Given the opportunities provided by Conservative policies, many more families now enjoy the pride of ownership of homes, of shares and of pensions.  Together we are building One Nation of free, prosperous and responsible families and people. A Conservative dream is at last becoming a reality.  This Manifesto points the way forward.  MARGARET THATCHER  THE BRITISH REVIVAL  This manifesto sets out our vision for the Britain of the 1990s and beyond, a future based on the aspirations of millions of individuals and their families their hopes, their needs, their security. For the first time in a generation this country looks forward to an era of real prosperity and fulfilment.  A vast change separates the Britain of today from the Britain of the late 1970s. Is it really only such a short time ago that inflation rose to an annual rate of 27 per cent? That the leader of the Transport and General Workers' Union was widely seen as the most powerful man in the land? That a minority Labour Government, staggering from crisis to crisis on borrowed money, was nonetheless maintained in power by the Liberal Party in return for the paper concession of a Lib-Lab pact? And that Labour's much-vaunted pay pact with the unions collapsed in the industrial anarchy of the ""winter of discontent"", n which the dead went unburied, rubbish piled up in the streets and the country was gripped by a creeping paralysis which Labour was powerless to cure?  It seems in retrospect to be the history of another country. Yet these things happened and people had to accept them as an unavoidable part of everyday life.  REVERSING THE DECLINE  Remember the conventional wisdom of the day. The British people were ""ungovernable"". We were in the grip of an incurable ""British disease"". Britain was heading for ""irreversible decline"".  Well, the people were not ungovernable, the disease was not incurable, the decline has been reversed.  - Britain today is in the seventh successive year of steady economic growth. We have moved from the bottom to the top of the growth league of major European countries.  - In Britain today. inflation has reached its lowest levels for almost twenty years.  - In Britain today, the number of strikes has dropped to the lowest levels for 50 years.  - In Britain today. far from being in debt to the IMF, we have built up our net overseas assets to their highest level since the Second World War - higher than France, Germany and the United States, second only to Japan.  - In Britain today. living standards are higher than ever before in our history.  But these are bald statistics. What matters is the feel of the country - the new enthusiasm for enterprise, the new spirit that Britain can make it, that we can prosper with the best. Investment in British industry is rising strongly. Our services sector, employing almost two-thirds of our workforce, generates a vast surplus of foreign earnings. And our manufacturers are travelling the globe with a new confidence born of the knowledge that Britain is internationally competitive again.  THE WORLD STAGE  This national revival is not confined to increased economic strength. Britain is also playing a major part on the international stage. From the White House through Europe to the Kremlin our voice is heard on arms control, on East-West issues, on human rights, on the Middle East and on African affairs.  With the Conservative Government, Britain has played a strong and responsible role internationally. We have defended civilised values by fighting terrorism relentlessly. We have secured our national interests, as when we liberated the Falklands. We have been ready to settle long-standing issues like Hong Kong where we reached an agreement to safeguard the way of life of the people.  Time and again we have shown that we possess the essential requirements of successful diplomacy: we stand firm on principles yet are ready to negotiate and prepared to take decisive action.  FOUNDED IN STRENGTH  The ability to act internationally does not come without effort. It must be founded on a strong economy and a robust defence. This Government took the necessary steps to build up both. Success has followed.  - Prudent financial policies have made Britain one of the world's largest creditors. Today we are able to shape world efforts to sustain trade and promote international monetary co-operation.  - We gave a lead in NATO and installed Cruise missiles. Today, as a result, the Soviet Union is at last prepared to negotiate to remove its own missiles targeted against us.  - This Government is modernising our own independent deterrent. Today Britain retains an independent influence in arms control negotiations between the superpowers.  By such steadfastness, we have not only rebuilt our economy and re-established our world reputation; we have also regained our national self-respect. But restoring a country's greatness is not easy. The new Conservative policies met bitter resistance every step of the way.  REMEMBER:  The year-long coal strike, with its violence and intimidation on a massive scale. It failed and mining productivity has since soared.  The battle we had to fight to ensure that Britain paid no more than its fair share of the European Community Budget. We now get automatic rebates - this year, over £1.3 billion.  The doubling of the oil price which confronted the new Government with a world-wide recession - and, more recently, an equally dramatic fall in the oil price which halved government oil revenues and in earlier times would have threatened a collapse of confidence in the pound. Both these oil ""shocks"" were successfully withstood by prudent policies wl1ich have produced a sustained growth of prosperity.  And let us not forget the challenge of the Falklands War.  How many of the alternative governments on offer would have stood firm, overcome, or even survived such difficulties? Does anyone suppose that the Labour Party would have resisted, let alone defeated, the violence and intimidation in the coal strike? Or that the Liberals or the Social Democrats would have fought so hard for our rebate from the Europ6an Community? Or that any of the Opposition parties would have persevered through all these difficulties to break the back of inflation and restore honest money?  A STRONG AND STABLE GOVERNMENT  How has it been done? All these improvements in the wealth and standing of our country have only been possible because we have had a strong government with sound policies and a decisive majority in Parliament. A weak government with uncertain policies would not have known how to withstand the pressures upon it; a government without a good overall majority in Parliament would not have been allowed to do so; and a strong government with unso1ind policies would have been a positive force for disaster.  In this election, only the Conservative Party is offering strong, decisive and united government.  THE NEXT MOVES FORWARD  The next Conservative Government will build on the achievements of the past eight years with a full programme of positive reform.  We will continue:  - to pursue policies of sound financial management, the conquest of inflation, the promotion of enterprise and the growth of employment;  - to spread the ownership of homes, shares, pensions and savings ever more widely to give families greater financial independence;  - to give people greater choice and responsibility over their own lives in important areas such as housing and education;  - to improve the well-being of the people through better health care, and to safeguard the living standards of those who have to depend on the community;  - to improve the quality of life by conserving the best of our heritage and our countryside, and by fostering provision for the arts and sport;  - to exercise strong leadership where government needs to be strong in protecting the nation against potential aggression and the citizen against lawlessness.  We intend to press on with the radical Conservative reform which we embarked upon in 1979, and which has already revived the spirit of our people and restored the reputation of our country.  WIDER OWNERSHIP AND GREATER OPPORTUNITY  Conservatives aim to extend as widely as possible the opportunity to own property and build up capital, to exercise real choice in education, and to develop economic independence and security.  Our goal is a capital-owning democracy of people and families who exercise power over their own lives n the most direct way. They would take the important decisions - as tenants, home-owners, parents, employees, and trade unionists rather than having them taken for them.  Of course, it is not possible to give people independence. That is something we must all achieve by our own efforts. But what this Conservative Government has done is to make it easier for people to acquire independence for themselves:  - by introducing the right to buy council houses;  - by returning nationalised industries to the people in ways that encourage the widest possible spread of ownership;  - by making it easier to buy shares in British industry through employee share schemes and Personal Equity Plans.  These opportunities - all too often introduced n the teeth of fierce resistance from the Opposition parties - have achieved spectacular results. There has been a surge of home- ownership, share-ownership and self-reliance.  And because these first-time shareholders and home-owners are more independent, they develop a more independent outlook. They are no longer content that some of the most important decisions in their lives what school their children attend, for example, or whether or not to go on strike should be taken by officialdom or trade union bosses. People want to decide such things for themselves.  In this way the scope of individual responsibility is widened, the family is strengthened, and voluntary bodies flourish. State power is checked and opportunities are spread throughout society. Ownership and independence cease to be the privileges of a few and become the birthright of all.  In this way One Nation is finally reached not by a single people being conscripted into an organised socialist programme but by millions of people building their own lives in their own way.  Better Housing for All  HOME OWNERSHIP  Nowhere has the spread of ownership been more significant than in housing. Buying their own home is the first step most people take towards building up capital to hand down to their children and grandchildren. It gives people a stake in society - something to conserve. It is the foundation stone of a capital-owning democracy.  A home should be a source of pride and independence to the family living in it, regardless of whether it is owned or rented. We will ensure that every family in the land has the opportunity to make it so.  Home-ownership has been the great success story of housing policy in the last eight years. One million council tenants have become home-owners and another one and a half million more families have become home-owners for the first time.  Two out of every three homes are now owned by the people who live in them. This is a very high proportion, one of the largest in the world. We are determined to make it larger still.  Some people are still deterred by the costs and complications of house purchase. That is why we must look for new ways to make house-buying simpler and easier. Our abolition of the conveyancing monopoly has already made it cheaper.  We will keep the present system of mortgage tax relief.  We will target improvement grants to where they are most needed - to the least well- off. To meet the special needs of old people, we will ensure that all local authorities have powers to give improvement grants, where necessary, for properties where elderly people move in with relatives. We will extend the 30 per cent housing association grant to help schemes for old people.  A RIGHT TO RENT  Most problems in housing now arise in the rented sector. Controls, although well-meant, have dramatically reduced the private rented accommodation to a mere 8 per cent of the housing market.  This restricts housing choice and hinders the economy. People looking for work cannot easily move to a different area to do so. Those who find work may not be able to find rented accommodation nearby. Those who would prefer to rent rather than buy are forced to become reluctant owner-occupiers or to swell the queue for council houses. Some may even become temporarily homeless.  And it is not only these people and their families who suffer from the shortage of homes for rent. The economy as a whole is damaged when workers cannot move to fill jobs because there are no homes to rent in the neighbourhood.  This must be remedied. We have already taken some modest steps in this direction by making it easier to part-own and part-rent homes through shared ownership; by bringing in and widening the scheme for assured tenancies; by our system of shortholds; and by providing a new 30 per cent housing association grant to build hostels for young workers. We have also directly tackled the problem of homelessness through new grants to housing associations and other measures.  More must now be done. The next Conservative Government, having already implemented the right to buy, will increase practical opportunities to rent.  We must attract new private investment into rented housing - both from large institutions such as building societies and housing associations as well as from small private landlords. To do this we intend, in particular, to build on two initiatives we have already taken,  First, to encourage more investment by institutions, we will extend the system of assured tenancies. This will permit new lettings in which rents and the period of lease will be freely agreed between tenants and landlords. The tenant will have security of tenure and will renegotiate the rent at the end of the lease, with provision for arbitration if necessary.  Second, to encourage new lettings by smaller landlords, we will develop the system of shorthold. The rents of landlords will be limited to a reasonable rate of return, and the tenant's security of tenure will be limited to the term of the lease, which would be not less than 6 months. This will bring back into use many of the 550,000 private dwellings which now stand empty because of controls, as well as making the provision of new rented housing a more attractive investment.  And we will revise the housing benefit system to ensure that it prevents landlords from increasing rents to unreasonable levels at the taxpayer's expense.  All existing private and housing association tenants will continue to have their present protection in respect of rents and security of tenure.  We will strengthen the law against harassment and unlawful eviction.  RIGHTS FOR COUNCIL TENANTS  Many council estates built in the sixties and seventies are badly designed, vulnerable to crime and vandalism and in bad repair. In many areas, rent arrears are high. In all, over 110,000 council dwellings stand empty. Yet it is often difficult for tenants to move. If they are ever to enjoy the prospect of independence, municipal monopoly must be replaced by choice in renting.  We will give groups of tenants the right to form tenant co-operatives, owning and running their management and budget for themselves. They will also have the right to ask other institutions to take over their housing. Tenants who wish to remain with the local authority will be able to do so.  We will give each council house tenant individually the right to transfer the ownership of his or her house to a housing association or other independent, approved landlord.  In some areas more may be necessary. The success of Estate Action and Housing Action Areas shows how a carefully targeted approach can transform an area of poor housing and give people there new hope. Our Urban Development Corporations have been successful in restoring derelict industrial areas. We believe that a similar approach could be adopted for housing in some places. We will take powers to create Housing Action Trusts initially as a pilot scheme to take over such housing, renovate it, and pass it on to different tenures and ownerships including housing associations, tenant co-operatives, owner-occupiers or approved private landlords.  We will reform the structure of local authority housing accounts so that public funds are directed at the problems of repair and renovation; maintenance and management are improved; resources are directed to the areas where the problems are greatest; rent arrears are reduced; and fewer houses are left empty.  Housing is the biggest single investment that most people make - whether in money or in time, skill and effort. In the last eight years, as a result of our policies, we have seen a dramatic increase in home-ownership. In the next five years, we will complement that with policies designed to improve the supply and condition of the rented housing stock.  A Capital-Owning Democracy  SHARE OWNERSHIP  Home-ownership leads naturally to other forms of financial provision for the future - notably to pensions and share-ownership. Half of the working population are in occupational pension schemes, but in 1979 only seven per cent of the population held shares.  People were deterred by the sheer unfamiliarity of owning shares. Young people were reluctant to save for a retirement which seemed far away. And most tax incentives encouraged saving through institutions rather than directly.  With a Conservative Government, all that has been changing. We were determined to make share-ownership available to the whole nation. Just as with cars, television sets, washing machines and foreign holidays, it would no longer be a privilege of the few; it would become the expectation of the many. We achieved this historic transformation in three ways:  First, we introduced major tax incentives for employee share-ownership. Seven out of the last eight budgets have included measures to encourage people to purchase shares in the company in which they work.  Second, starting this year, we brought in Personal Equity Plans, which enable people to invest in British industry entirely free of tax.  Third, we embarked on a major programme of privatisation, insisting that small investors and employees of the privatised companies should have a fair chance to join in the buying.  The results have been dramatic, and the direct consequence of government policy. Share ownership has trebled. Almost one in five of the adult population now own shares directly. And the figure will continue to rise. Of this total, the majority are first-time shareholders and most of them own shares in either privatised companies or the TSB group. One-and-a-half million people hold shares in the companies where they work.  After eight years of Conservative Government, Britain is now at the forefront of a world wide revolution in extending ownership. One in every five British adults now owns shares compared to one in ten Frenchmen and one in twenty Japanese. Only the Americans, where a quarter of the people are shareholders, remain ahead - and the gap is narrowing.  This is the first stage of a profound and progressive social transformation - popular capitalism. Owning a direct stake in industry not only enhances personal independence; it also gives a heightened sense of involvement and pride in British business. More realistic attitudes to profit and investment take root. And the foundations of British economic achievement are further strengthened.  We will press on with the encouragement of popular capitalism.  In the next Parliament:  - We will continue to extend share-ownership as we have done with home-ownership.  - We will reintroduce our proposed tax incentives for profit-related pay.  - We will privatise more state industries in ways that increase share-ownership, both for the employees and for the public at large.  Raising Standards in Education  Parents want schools to provide their children with the knowledge, training and character that will fit them for today's world. They want them to be taught basic educational skills, They want schools that will encourage moral values: honesty, hard work and responsibility. And they should have the right to choose those schools which do these things for their children.  RAISING STANDARDS IN OUR SCHOOLS  How can all this best be done? Resources obviously matter. This Government has provided more resources for pupils than ever before.  With the Conservatives:  - Spending per primary pupil has risen by 17 per cent after allowing for inflation and per secondary pupil by 20 per cent under our Government.  - There are more teachers in proportion to pupils than ever before.  - British schools are world leaders in the use of computers in the classroom.  But money alone is not enough. Increased resources have not produced uniformly higher standards. Parents and employers are rightly concerned that not enough children master the basic skills, that some of what is taught seems irrelevant to a good education and that standards of personal discipline and aspirations are too low. In certain cases education is used for political indoctrination and sexual propaganda. The time has now come for school reform.  FOUR MAJOR REFORMS  First, we will establish a National Core Curriculum.  It is vital to ensure that all pupils between the ages of 5 to 16 study a basic range of subjects - including maths, English and science. In each of these basic subjects syllabuses will be published and attainment levels set so that the progress of pupils can be assessed at around ages 7, 11 and 14, and in preparation for the GCSE at 16. Parents, teachers and pupils will then know how well each child is doing. We will consult widely among those concerned n establishing the curriculum.  Second, within five years governing bodies and head teachers of all secondary schools and many primary schools will be given control over their own budgets.  They know best the needs of their school. With this independence they will manage their resources and decide their priorities, covering the cost of books, equipment, maintenance and staff. Several pilot schemes for financial devolution to schools have already proved their worth, such as those in Cambridgeshire and Solihull.  Third, we will increase parental choice.  The most consistent pressure for high standard in schools comes from parents. They have a powerful incentive to ensure that their children receive a good education. We have already done much through the 1980 and 1986 Education Acts so that parents can make their voice heard. But parents still need better opportunities to send their children to the school of their choice. That would be the best guarantee of higher standards. To achieve this:  We will ensure that Local Education Authorities (LEAs) set school budgets in line with the number of pupils who will be attending each school.  Schools will be required to enrol children up to the school's physical capacity instead of artificially restricting pupil numbers, as can happen today. Popular schools, which have earned parental support by offering good education, will then be able to expand beyond present pupil numbers.  These steps will compel schools to respond to the views of parents. But there must also be variety of educational provision so that parents can better compare one school with another.  We will therefore support the co-existence of a variety of schools - comprehensive, grammar, secondary modern, voluntary controlled and aided, independent, sixth form and tertiary colleges as well as the reasonable rights of schools to retain their sixth forms, all of which will give parents greater choice and lead to higher standards.  We will establish a pilot network of City Technology Colleges. Already two have been announced and support for more has been pledged by industrial sponsors.  We will expand the Assisted Places Scheme to 35,000. This highly successful scheme has enabled 25,000 talented children from less-well-off backgrounds to gain places at the 230 independent schools currently in the scheme.  We will continue to defend the right to independent education as part of a free society. It is under threat from all the other parties.  Fourth, we will allow state schools to opt out of LEA control.  If, in a particular school, parents and governing bodies wish to become independent of the LEA, they will be given the choice to do so. Those schools which opt out of LEA control will receive a full grant direct from the Department of Education and Science. They would become independent charitable trusts.  In the area covered by the Inner London Education Authority, where entire borough councils wish to become independent of the LEA, they will be able to submit proposals to the Secretary of State requesting permission to take over the provision of education within their boundaries.  VILLAGE SCHOOLS  We recognise the important contribution made by small rural primary schools to education and to the community life of our villages. We will ensure, therefore, that the future of these schools is judged by wider factors than merely the number of pupils attending them.  PRE-SCHOOL EDUCATION  Eighty per cent of all three- and four-year-olds in this country attend nursery classes, reception classes or playgroups. Formal nursery education is not necessarily the most appropriate experience for children. Diversity of provision is desirable. LEAs should look to support the voluntary sector alongside their own provision.  A BETTER CAREER FOR TEACHERS  We recognise the importance of teachers and wish to enhance their professional status. The Government has provided a record amount of money to increase their pay by an average 16.4 per cent this year 25 per cent over 18 months. Our new pay award will encourage able young people to enter the career of teaching and reward the many good teachers already in the profession.  The Burnham negotiating machinery finally broke down and has been temporarily replaced by an Interim Advisory Committee. The Government wants an effective and permanent machinery for settling teachers' pay, in which the interests of all parties will be recognised.  The Government will produce a Green Paper setting out the various alternatives and will enter into wide consultations with a view to establishing a new and effective machinery.  Higher and Further Education  The British system of higher education is among the best in the world. It ranges from universities to further education colleges providing skills and qualifications. We recognise the value of research and scholarship for their own sake. At the same time we must meet the nation's demand for highly qualified manpower to compete in international markets.  Building on our achievements since 1979 - 157,000 more full-time and part-time students we want to expand higher education opportunities still further. By 1990, we plan to increase student numbers by a further 50,000, and to raise the proportion of 18-year-olds in higher education.  We will replace the University Grants Committee with an independent statutory body on the lines recommended by the Croham Committee. The new body will be called the Universities Funding Council (UFC) and will have broadly equal numbers of academic and non-academic members with a chairman who has substantial experience outside the academic world. The primary responsibility of the UFC will be the allocation of funds to individual universities under new contractual arrangements.  Polytechnics are today strong, successful and mature institutions. They are complementary to the universities. Their present structure, under local authorities, is inappropriate for an expanding national role.  As part of our policy to delegate power and responsibility, we will legislate to convert the polytechnics and other mainly higher education colleges in England to free-standing corporate bodies under boards of governors.  We will set up a new Polytechnics and Colleges Funding Council independent of central Government, in place of local authority control.  As part of our aim to widen access to higher education we have begun a review of student support which is the most generous in the western world. We need to modernise this system which has not changed for 25 years. The purpose of the review is to improve the overall prospects of students so that more are encouraged to enter higher education. No final conclusions have been reached, but we believe that top-up loans to supplement grants are one way, among others, of bringing in new finance to help students and relieve pressure on their parents.  We will take care to ensure that the best aspects of the present system are retained in any new proposals which we bring forward.  Trade Unions  It is not only in relation to government, however, that people's right to choice and independence must be safeguarded and extended. Great social institutions can sometimes become too powerful and cease to represent their members, denying them any control over the decisions taken in their name and even forcing them to act against their own interests. That was the case with trade unions before 1979.  Since then, Conservative reforms have redressed the balance between the individual and his union, preventing coercion of the majority by activists and militants. These highly successful and popular measures have encouraged democracy within the unions, restrained the abuses of secondary action and picketing, reversed the growth of closed shops, restored the rights of redress against unions acting unlawfully and removed the immunity of unions that call a strike without a fair ballot.  The result has been a transformation of shopfloor relations, allowing management and workforce to co-operate to improve working practices and introduce new technology to mutual gain. In the next Parliament we will protect the rights of individual trade union members.  We will introduce legislation to:  - empower individual members to stop their unions calling them out on strike without first holding a secret ballot of members;  - protect individual members from disciplinary action if they refuse to join a strike they disagree with;  - ensure that all members of trade union governing bodies are elected by secret ballot at least once every five years;  - make independently supervised postal ballots compulsory for such elections;  - limit further the abuse of the closed shop by providing protection against unfair dismissal for all non-union employees, and removing any legal immunity from industrial action to establish or enforce a closed shop;  - provide new safeguards on the use of union funds;  - establish a new trade union commissioner with the power to help individual trade unionists to enforce their fundamental rights.  BUILDING PROSPERITY AND EMPLOYMENT  Since this Government took office in 1979, we have restored honest money and established a stable economic framework in which business can flourish. We have been careful not to spend money before we earned it. We have brought the nation back to living within its means. We have massively rebuilt our international assets. We have refused to be drawn into an auction of pledges for higher spending that the country simply could not afford. We have balanced the books. We have paid our way.  The results have been dramatic.  - Despite the coal strike and the collapse of the oil price, Britain has moved from being bottom to the top of the growth league of major European countries.  - Inflation has reached its lowest levels for almost 20 years.  - The basic rate of income tax has been cut from 33p to 27p, four taxes have been abolished, and almost a million and a half people have been taken out of income tax altogether.  - Over a million extra jobs have been created since 1983 more than in the rest of the European Community put together.  - Unemployment, a problem throughout Europe, is now firmly on a downward trend - with youth unemployment in this country below the European average.  - We have rebuilt our net overseas assets to some £110 billion from a mere £12 billion when we first took office. This will provide substantial foreign earnings in the years ahead and a cushion, should oil revenues fall.  While the Opposition parties cling to the failed policies of the past, our strategy has become widely accepted abroad. Socialist Spain as well as Christian Democratic Germany, Social Democratic Sweden as well as France, Labour New Zealand and Conservative Canada, all accept that governments must reduce their borrowing, curb state spending, reduce taxation, privatise state firms and do away with unnecessary controls. What we began in 1979 is today common international practice.  Stable Prices  Our greatest economic challenge on entering office was to defeat inflation. Rampant inflation under the Labour Government, when money lost a quarter of its value in a single year, had reduced our economy to ""the sick man of Europe"".  Nothing erodes a country's competitive edge faster than inflation. Nothing so undermines personal thrift and independence as to see the value of a lifetime's savings eaten away in retirement through spiralling prices. And nothing threatens the social fabric of a nation more than the conflicts and divisiveness which inflation creates.  Our success in the battle against inflation has been the key to Britain's economic revival. It required firm control of public expenditure, a substantial reduction in government borrowing, curbing the growth of money in circulation, maintaining financial discipline, stimulating competition and moderating trade union power.  The Opposition parties opposed nearly every aspect of this strategy. If even some of their policies were implemented today, higher borrowing and higher spending would once again unleash inflation.  There is no better yardstick of a party's fitness to govern that its attitude to inflation. Nothing is so politically immoral as a party that ignores that yardstick.  The Conservative Government will continue to put the conquest of inflation as our first objective. We will not be content until we have stable prices, with inflation eradicated altogether.  Lower Taxes  We are the only Party that believes in lower taxation.  As the Party determined to achieve growing prosperity we recognise that it is people who create wealth, not governments. Lower taxation coupled with lower inflation makes everyone better off. It encourages people to work harder, to be inventive and to take risks. It promotes a climate of enterprise and initiative.  Lower tax on earnings enables people to build up savings to give them financial security in later life.  Lower taxation, by increasing take-home pay without adding to industry's costs, improves competitiveness and helps with jobs. And tax relief for charitable donations encourages more people to give and to give more generously.  There is a strong moral case for reducing taxation. High taxes deprive people of their independence and make their choices for them. The desire to do better for one's family is one of the strongest motives in human nature. As a party committed to the family and opposed to the over-powerful State, we want people to keep more of what they earn, and to have more freedom of choice about what they do for themselves, their families and for others less fortunate.  Governments should trust people to spend their own money sensibly and decently; high taxation prevents them doing so.  That is why we have:  - cut the basic rate of tax from 33p to 27p in the £, and increased the personal allowances (the starting point for paying tax) by 22 per cent more than inflation. If Labour's tax regime were still in force, the family man on average earnings would today be paying more than £500 per year in extra income tax: a headmaster married to a nurse would be paying more than £1,300 extra;  - reduced sharply the absurd top rates of tax inherited from Labour which were causing so many of our most talented people to work abroad;  - increased greatly the tax relief for charitable donations. Giving to charities has doubled since we first took office;  - abolished four taxes completely: the national insurance surcharge - the tax which Labour put on jobs - the investment income surcharge, the development land tax and the lifetime gifts tax;  - reformed and simplified corporation tax, and cut its rate to the lowest of any major industrial country;  - cut the small business corporation tax rate by more than a third, and extended it to many more small businesses;  - reformed and reduced capital taxes as well as slashing stamp duty.  In every case where taxes have been reformed and reduced there has been an increase in the amount of tax collected.  Labour totally fail to understand the benefits this brings to everyone. Today they openly threaten to raise taxation. To fulfil their plans, they would have to raise taxes substantially. Indeed, all the Opposition parties Labour, Liberals and SDP - would raise taxation. We believe that it is precisely the wrong thing to do.  It will be our aim to do the opposite.  In the next Parliament:  - We aim to reduce the burden of taxation.  - In particular, we will cut income tax still further and reduce the basic rate to 25p in the £ as soon as we prudently can.  - We will continue the process of tax reform.  Spending We Can Afford  Over the past eight years we have managed the nation's finances with care. Even allowing for inflation, this has enabled us to spend substantially more on the Health Service (up by 31 per cent), defence (up by 23 per cent), roads (up by 17 per cent), education per pupil (up by 18 per cent), the police and the battle against crime (up by 47 per cent), the disabled and long-term sick (up by 72 per cent), and government training schemes (up by 120 per cent).  How have we been able to do this without running into the financial crises which Labour's spending policies invariably set off?  First, we have been prudent with the nation's money. We have slashed public borrowing and sought savings in government expenditure wherever they could sensibly be found.  Second, we are engaged in steadily reducing the share of the nation's income taken by the State. This means that more will be left for families and for business to invest - the only safe route to higher growth in the economy.  Third, we have constantly improved the efficiency of the public services, ensuring that we get more value for every pound spent.  For the next Parliament:  - Our aim is to ensure that public expenditure takes a steadily smaller share of our national income.  - Within that objective, we will continue to spend more on our priorities. We have set out our plans for further increased spending in these areas over the next three years.  CREATING NEW JOBS  High unemployment is one of the most intractable problems facing all Western industrialised countries.  We understand the anxiety and stress which unemployment can cause. For almost a year unemployment in the United Kingdom has fallen faster than among any of our major competitors in Europe, and faster than at any time since 1973. It is falling because of the growth and enterprise we have achieved, assisted by the employment and training programmes we have developed.  Since we were last re-elected in 1983, the number of jobs has risen by over 1 million more than in the rest of the European Community put together. This Government has established the conditions in which business can prosper and create new jobs. This has not just been achieved through the revitalisation of traditional industries. We have encouraged growth in those crucial areas of new enterprise which provide the foundation for the jobs of the future - self-employment, small firms, the creation of new enterprise, the expanding service sector - particularly tourism and leisure - and new technology.  Self-employment is the seedcorn of the new enterprises of tomorrow. Without sufficient people to start new businesses, the future of our whole economy is in jeopardy. Today we have the highest number of self-employed for over 60 years. One worker in ten is now his own boss - or her own boss, since a quarter of the self-employed are women. Indeed, the eighties have seen almost three-quarters of a million people become self-employed. More and more of our young people today seek self-employment as a worthwhile career. It is particularly encouraging that almost half the growth in self-employment since 1983 has been in the northern part of our country.  Small firms, along with all businesses, have benefited from our management of the economy. Since this Government took office, the number of registered businesses has shown a net increase of more than 500 a week - and the number has increased in every region of the country.  Helping Unemployed People into Jobs  As well as creating a climate in which business could employ more people, we have developed programmes to help those out of work.  The Youth Training Scheme (YTS) caters for school-leavers aged 16 and 1 7 who wish to participate in training and work experience. Every trainee is given the opportunity of working towards a recognised qualification.  The new Job Training Scheme (JTS), which started in April this year, will offer a chance to any person over 18 who has been unemployed for six months or more, who wants to work and train with an employer for a recognised qualification. This year it will help nearly a quarter of a million people.  Under our Community Programme, each year over 300,000 people who have been out of work for some time gain valuable experience working on community projects. They have a reference to show potential employers.  We will improve the Community Programme to make it full-time and better able to help those with families. We shall pay those working on the programme an allowance giving a premium over and above their social security payments.  Under the Enterprise Allowance Scheme, 230,000 unemployed people have started to work for themselves. Many of them have now become employers themselves.  JobClubs were first opened in 1985 to help the unemployed help themselves back into jobs. Over 1,000 have been established. At present two-thirds of those leaving JobClubs go into employment.  The JobClubs programme has been a great success. We aim to expand it.  Our economic success means that we can now do more to help those out of work.  Although youth unemployment has declined in the last year it still remains a problem. Far too many of our youngsters leave school with an education that has failed to prepare them for the world of work. At the same time, by maintaining high starting wages comparable to those of fully trained craftsmen, trade unions have kept many of them out of work.  In 1983 we introduced the first Youth Training Scheme. It is now a national two-year programme aimed at giving young people qualifications for work.  THE FIRST GUARANTEE  We will now guarantee a place on the Youth Training Scheme to every school-leaver under 18 who is not going directly into a job.  As a result, none of these school-leavers need be unemployed. They can remain at school, move to college, get a job, or receive a guaranteed training. YTS will serve as a bridge between school and work.  We will take steps to ensure that those under 18 who deliberately choose to remain unemployed are not eligible for benefit. We will of course continue to protect other young people, such as those who suffer from disabilities.  THE SECOND GUARANTEE  There are still too many young people without the right qualifications for employment in today's world.  Within a year we aim to guarantee a place, either on the Job Training Scheme or on the Enterprise Allowance Scheme or in a JobClub, for everyone aged between 1 8 and 25 years who has been unemployed for between six and twelve months.  THE THIRD GUARANTEE  In addition to these major programmes we have taken one further important step.  Restart is a programme we have set up for interviewing and counselling the long-term unemployed to help them into a job or training. Everyone who has been unemployed for more than one year has already been given an interview.  We will guarantee to provide the Restart service in the future at six-monthly intervals, to all those who have been unemployed for more than six months.  Over the next five years we will aim, through the Restart interviews, to offer everyone who is under 50, and who has been unemployed for more than two years, a place in the Job Training Scheme or in the new Community Programme, in a JobClub or in the Enterprise Allowance Scheme.  REGIONAL ASSISTANCE  Money spent on earlier programmes attracting firms to regions has sometimes created very few jobs. Our new system of regional assistance, introduced in 1984, ensures that aid is directly targeted towards the creation of new jobs. New activities in the service sector from which so many of the new jobs come have also been made eligible for assistance. Under the new policy, offers of assistance have already been made which should secure almost 300,000 jobs. We will continue to ensure that assistance is directed where it is most needed.  The Employment and Training Services  We will take further steps to provide a comprehensive service to the unemployed. We will consult the Manpower Services Commission about transferring JobCentres to the Department of Employment so that they can work more closely with Unemployment Benefit Offices.  The Manpower Services Commission would then become primarily a training agency. It is employers who are best equipped to assess their training needs.  We will increase employer representation on the Commission and its advisory bodies.  More jobs are being created by business and industry. Nothing would destroy whole industries more effectively than a return to the overmanning and restrictive practices of the 1970s. Our policies form a practical and realistic approach to help people back into work. We will build on prosperity to create more employment.  A FRAMEWORK FOR BUSINESS AND INDUSTRY  British business is in a healthier state than it has been for a generation. Output has been rising steadily for six years. Productivity has increased at a rate second only to Japan. Company profitability is at its highest for over twenty years. Industry has a confidence in the future that would have been unthinkable seven years ago.  Moreover, setting new records has not been confined to the private sector. Since 1983 productivity in the coal industry has risen by over 50 per cent. British Steel has more than doubled its productivity since 1979 and made a profit last year for the first time in over ten years. British Rail will cost the taxpayer 25 per cent less in subsidy this year than n 1983 and without any major route closures.  The Conservative Government has created a framework in which once again enterprise can flourish - by cutting red tape, by denationalising state-owned companies, by r4moving unnecessary restrictions, by abolishing exchange control, by enabling the City of London to become the foremost financial centre in the world, by keeping down prices through extending competition, and by ensuring access to open trade so that British exporters and consumers can both benefit.  Privatisation  Over a third of the companies and industries which used to be owned by the State have been returned to free enterprise. Productivity and profitability have soared in the newly privatised companies.  - In 1980 Jaguar made 14,000 cars a year, losing well over £3,000 on each Car sold. Now the company is hard put to keep up with overseas demand and last year sold over 40,00 cars, making a pre-tax profit of over £120m.  - Since the National Freight Consortium was sold to management and staff in 1982, pre-tax profits have increased sevenfold.  - British Aerospace, Cable & Wireless, Amersham International and Associated British Ports have all strikingly increased their profits.  It is no mystery why privatisation has succeeded. The overwhelming majority of employees have become shareholders in the newly privatised companies. They want their companies to succeed. Their companies have been released from the detailed controls of Whitehall and given more freedom to manage their own affairs. And they have been exposed to the full commercial disciplines of the customer. Even former monopolies now face increased competition.  We will continue the successful programme of privatisation.  In particular, after the privatisation of the British Airports Authority we will return to the public the Water Authorities, leaving certain functions to a new National Rivers Authority.  Following the success of gas privatisation, with the benefits it brought to employees and millions of consumers, we will bring forward proposals for privatising the electricity industry subject to proper regulation.  Competition  Competition forces the economy to respond to the needs of the consumer. It promotes efficiency, holds down costs, drives companies to innovate and ensures that customers get the best possible value for money.  Accordingly, this Government has:  - deregulated long-distance coach services creating over 700 new services with improved quality and lower fares;  - removed the monopoly on conveyancing of houses in England and Wales;  - removed the opticians' monopoly, making it easier and cheaper to buy spectacles;  - relaxed advertising controls on accountants, solicitors, stockbrokers and vets, and permitted greater fee competition for architects and surveyors;  - increased competition on air routes within the UK and between certain European countries, which has resulted in cheaper fares, a more responsive service and greater choice of carriers for the passenger;  - deregulated telecommunications, so that customers can now choose between suppliers when buying telephones and private exchanges, and business can choose between two alternative telecommunications networks;  - suspended the Post Office monopoly of time-sensitive and valuable mail, stimulating a dramatic increase in the number of private courier companies.  We will continue this approach.  But competition must be supplemented by legal protection for consumers. Those who make their living from their ideas and creations also require protection against theft.  We will introduce further measures to impose tighter controls on pyramid selling.  We will introduce measures to reform the law on copyright, design and performance protection.  The City  The City of London is the world's leading market place in foreign exchange, international bank lending and international insurance, It is a major source of funds for British companies. The financial services sector as a whole accounts for nearly 6 per cent of our national income, generates a net £7 billion per year to our balance of payments, and employs over one million people.  Like other sections of British industry, however, the City was held back by restrictive practices until they were swept away in last year's ""big bang"". This has brought nearer the day when shares can be bought and sold over the counter in every high street. We have also given building societies greater freedom to make a wider range of financial services available to the average family.  At the same time, the Conservative Government has introduced a legal framework to protect investors and consumers:  - The Companies Acts of 1980 and 1981 strengthened the powers of investigators and increased the courts' power to disqualify directors for misconduct in the City as elsewhere.  - The Insolvency Act of 1985 made it easier to disqualify directors who had been guilty of unlawful trading.  - And now the Financial Services Act of 1986 provides the first comprehensive system of investor protection we have had in this country. It also contains stringent new powers to investigate insider dealing which was first made a criminal offence by the Conservative Government in 1980.  The Conservative Party is the party of law and order. That applies just as much to City fraud as to street crime.  Parliament has just approved our proposals for establishing a Serious Fraud Office to improve the work of investigating and prosecuting the worst cases of fraud and for streamlining court procedure. After the election we will reintroduce our proposals to reform the outdated rules on evidence, as recommended by the Roskill Committee.  Trade  Britain exports 30 per cent of all that it produces. If this country is to remain a key trading nation, industry must remain competitive. That is one reason why the Conservative Government attaches great value to maintaining an open multinational trading system. Another is that increased trade is a major way of encouraging growth and prosperity in the Third World. There is little point in demanding more aid for these countries and then refusing them the opportunity to trade.  We will continue to fight for free and fair trade in international negotiations and resist the growth of protectionism.  We will press for international rules of fair trading to be extended to international investment, trade in services and the protection of intellectual property such as patents, trademarks and copyright.  We will continue to exert pressure on countries such as Japan to open up their markets and provide the same freedom to trade for our exporters as they expect us to provide for theirs.  As well as creating the commercial and legal framework in which industry can flourish, the Government must also ensure that the practical services on which industry and the citizen rely - transport, energy, research and development, and an efficient civil service - are provided to a high standard.  Efficient Transport  The Conservative Government is proud of a record that has:  - modernised the transport system by investing over £10 billion in the nation's motorways, roads, airports, seaports and railways;  - since 1979 completed over 680 miles of motorway and trunk roads and 67 bypasses;  - secured greater efficiency by privatising British Airways, the National Freight Corporation, Sealink and Associated British Ports;  - increased competition by deregulating long-distance coach services and abolishing local bus licensing.  These measures have laid the foundations of an efficient and more flexible transport system. We will develop it further along these lines. We are now returning the nationalised bus companies to the private sector in many cases to management buy-outs. We are also privatising the former British Airports Authority the world's leading international airports group.  We are committed to a major capital investment programme through:  - new investment to build an extra 450 miles of motorway and trunk roads to 1989/90;  - British Rail's plans to invest £500m a year over the next 3 years;  - private sector financing, construction and operation of the Dartford Bridge and the Channel tunnel.  Energy  Britain is the only major Western industrial country that is a net exporter of energy. This owes much to North Sea oil so successfully developed by free enterprise. But it is an advantage that will not last indefinitely.  Coal will continue to meet much of the steadily rising demand for electricity. Renewable sources of energy can make some contribution to the nation's energy needs, which is why government-sponsored research has been increased. Nevertheless, to reject, as our opponents do, the contribution of nuclear energy to supplying reliable, low-cost electricity, and to depend on coal alone, would be short-sighted and irresponsible.  The world's resources of fossil fuels will come under increasing strain during the 21st century; so may the global environment if the build-up of carbon dioxide the so-called ""greenhouse effect"" significantly raises temperatures and changes climates.  After the most careful and painstaking independent assessment of the safety case for a new pressurised water reactor at Sizewell, therefore, the Government has decided to proceed with the next phase of our nuclear programme. It is vital that we continue to give the highest priority to safety. Our nuclear industry has a record of safety and technical excellence second to none.  We intend to go on playing a leading role in the task of developing abundant, low-cost supplies of nuclear electricity, and managing the associated waste products.  Science and R & D  Government support for research and development amounts to more than £4½ billion per year. It is larger as a share of our national income than that of the United States, Japan or Germany. A country of our size cannot afford to do everything. These resources need to be better targeted. The task of government is to support basic research and to contribute where business cannot realistically be expected to carry all the risks.  We will ensure that government spending is firmly directed towards areas of high national priority, by extending the role of the Advisory Council on Applied Research and Development, drawing on the full range of advice from the academic community and from business.  The Civil Service  We have long had in this country a professional and dedicated public service which is the envy of the world. We are now building on those traditional qualities which can too easily be taken for granted with new strengths and skills: a greater readiness to adapt efficiently to change, including technological change, to manage the public service more effectively, and to see that the taxpayer gets value for money. The size of the Civil Service at under 600,000 people today is the smallest since the war. This is already saving the taxpayer £1 billion a year.  We will press on with long-term management reforms in order to improve public services and reduce their cost.  AGRICULTURE AND THE RURAL ECONOMY  Farming  Britain's farmers serve the nation well. They produce 80 per cent of the food we grow compared with 60 per cent only 10 years ago. They have made us into the world's sixth largest exporter of cereals when we had been a net importer for decades before. They look after 80 per cent of the British countryside. And consumer food prices have risen less than the cost of living, unlike the Labour years.  But farmers world-wide are under pressure because of rising surpluses and the huge costs of disposing of them. It is just as much in the farmers' interest as in the consumers' and taxpayers' that this over-production be stopped and a radical overhaul of the Common Agricultural Policy achieved. Farmers need a more sustainable environment in which to plan ahead.  We will continue:  - to play a leading part in European Community negotiations to reform the CAP;  - to strive for even-handed and fair treatment between Member States and between the different regions of the UK;  - to work for an early devaluation of the Green Pound, especially in relation to beef; to uphold the interests of the efficient family farm;  - to reduce costs and tackle surpluses, by bringing supply and demand in the Community  - into better balance by a combination of measures including price restraint;  - to reduce the role for intervention, At home we will continue:  - to promote competitiveness and innovation in British farming and horticulture;  - to give particular assistance to farmers in the Less Favoured Areas, recently extended, where farming is difficult;  - to encourage better marketing of agricultural and horticultural products and to ensure that the consumer has as much information about the contents of food as is necessary to make sensible choices.  We will not introduce rating on agricultural land and will oppose two-tier pricing in the CAP, which would greatly disadvantage our farmers and benefit their competitors.  The Rural Economy  Farming is, and will remain, the major industry in the countryside and food production will continue to be the farmer's basic purpose. The higher production resulting from greater efficiency and modern techniques initially means more land coming out of agriculture. A new balance of policies has to be struck, with less support for expanding production of commodities already in over-supply and more support for diversifying into other activities.  We have recognised the new needs of the countryside and rural economies in two ways. First, we now place more emphasis on support for the environment and the beauty of the countryside; we now give grants to plant hedgerows, not dig them up. Second, we encourage alternative uses of land and more diverse job opportunities to maintain thriving communities in the rural economy.  We will therefore:  - emphasise environmental protection and promotion of non-farming rural businesses in the planning system;  - continue to support the Development Commission in developing rural enterprises;  - extend the Environmentally Sensitive Areas scheme which makes conservation a more integral part of farming;  - introduce new schemes to assist diversification of new enterprises on farms;  - introduce a new Farm Woodland Scheme to assist alternative land use.  The UK Fishing Industry  Our fishing industry supplies two-thirds of the fish we eat. It is an important source of jobs and income in many areas.  The Government's success in further improving the Common Fisheries Policy has meant that international policing has been made more effective; and increasingly stringent conservation measures have secured the future for our fleets.  We will introduce legislation to ensure that UK quotas are reserved for UK fishermen. We are pledged to measures to enable our fishermen to take full advantage of all their opportunities and to improve and modernise their boats.  Animal Welfare  The Conservatives have a proud record over the years of promoting animal welfare. Most of the legislation was either initiated by Conservative governments or introduced as Private Members' measures by Conservative MPs when the Conservatives were in office.  Since 1979 we have:  - set up the Farm Animal Welfare Council which advises the Government on the welfare of farm animals. We will continue to care for them with the advice and guidance of the Farm Animal Welfare Council;  - honoured our commitment to replace the 1876 legislation with the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 - the most effective in Europe. It imposes tight new controls on the use of animals for experiments. The number of experiments has declined in each of the last nine years, and we expect that decline to continue.  BETTER HEALTH, BETTER CARE  Achievements in Health  The health of the British people is steadily improving. Quite simply, we live longer. Life expectancy has increased and infant mortality has declined.  Over the last eight years the Government has spent more on the Health Service than any previous government, Labour or Conservative. In 1979, the outgoing Labour Government planned to spend less than £8 billion on the nation's health. This year, the Conservative Government will spend nearly £21 billion. After allowing for inflation, that is an increase of almost a third. This extra money has been spent wisely and well. The Health Service today is treating more patients than ever before in its history.  Money is important, but the success of the NHS depends still more on the dedication of the people working in it. There are over 75,000 more doctors, dentists and nurses than in 1978. These extra staff have enabled the NHS to treat 6 million more patient cases - in-patients, day cases, out-patients than when we took office. Sometimes they work in very difficult conditions. That is why the Government has reduced nurses' basic hours from 40 to 37 1/2 hours per week and increased their pay by 30 per cent after allowing for inflation.  We will continue to improve the Health Service.  Future Tasks for the Health Service  Our policies rest on six principles:  First, we will give greater emphasis to the prevention of avoidable illness and the promotion of good health to make the NHS more truly a health service and not merely a sickness service.  Much progress has been made in the past eight years.  - The improvement of the maternity services has helped to reduce by a third the death rate among babies in the weeks around birth.  - The expansion of vaccination and immunisation has prevented illness and death among children.  - Screening for cervical cancer has been improved and death rates from the disease have fallen by almost 10 per cent in the past decade.  - We have already embarked on a major campaign to tackle the problem of coronary heart disease.  - To fight AIDS, the Government has undertaken the biggest health education campaign ever seen in this country one much admired abroad and is fully supporting the Medical Research Council in a special programme of research towards treatments and vaccines.  These are welcome advances.  In the next Parliament, we will build on this work by:  - completing the network of computerised 'call and recall' systems for cervical cancer screening. and extending them to younger women;  - developing a national programme for breast cancer screening;  - backing the newly established and powerful Health Education Authority.  Second, we will continue to show our support for the million people working in the NHS, of whom half are nurses.  Nurses wanted the assurance that, without recourse to strike action, they would receive fair treatment over pay. That is why we set up the independent Nurses' Pay Review Body. After the latest award, we will have increased nurses' pay by 30 per cent since 1979, after allowing for inflation. That compares to the severe reduction of more than 20 per cent, which they suffered under the last Labour Government.  Nurses also want a training and career structure which reinforces their professionalism, rewards experience, and offers opportunities for managerial responsibility without being removed to a distant desk. We share those views, and will seek to further them. We are particularly keen to attract experienced nurses back into the profession, and to encourage others to take up nursing as a new career.  Hospital doctors and consultants, too, are a vital part of the Health Service. We have already increased the number of consultant posts and we will continue to work for improvements in the medical career structure.  The NHS could not function without ancillary services. Some of these cleaning, catering, and laundry have been put out to competitive tender to enable health authorities to select the best and most effective way of providing these services. Savings are now approaching £100 million a year and they have gone directly and immediately into better patient care.  We have undertaken consultation on the improvement of primary care. Our aim is to develop the strength and flexibility of the services provided by GPs, dentists, pharmacists, opticians and nurses who work in the community.  There are particular problems affecting health care in inner cities. Doctors and nurses there take on a particularly tough and difficult job. We shall continue to look for new ways of helping them and improving health care, especially primary care in the inner cities.  Our third principle is to modernise the whole framework of the health service its hospitals, its clinics, its equipment.  In the face of economic collapse, the last Labour Government cut the hospital building programme by a third. This Government has embarked on the biggest building programme ever. It will cost £3 billion. In seven years we have already carried through over 200 major building projects from start to finish.  We will complete some 125 further major new building schemes in the next three years, and get many more under way.  New hospitals, too, are being built in areas lacking the provision they need. Old and inefficient Victorian buildings are being replaced with purpose-built modern hospitals. Much modern medicine and surgery is better carried out in the new larger hospitals, equipped with new medical technology. Wherever possible, however, small old hospitals have found a new role as community hospitals staffed by local GPs.  Fourth, elderly, disabled, mentally ill and mentally handicapped people, should be cared for within the community whenever this is right for them.  In the past some people who should have been cared for in other ways have remained in hospitals, sometimes for years. That is changing. The number of children in long-stay hospitals for the mentally handicapped has fallen by almost three-quarters. The number of adults in long-stay mental handicap and mental illness hospitals has fallen by around 11 000.  This changing pattern has already brought a better life to many thousands of people. It has the potential to do so for many thousands more. But we need to examine carefully various alternatives to discover what is now best for patients. We have set in hand the first ever full-scale review of community care.  We will develop our policies in the light of its findings.  Our fifth principle is to strengthen management.  The NHS is a large and complex organisation. It needs good management. It is not a business, but it must be run in a business-like way.  The reduction of waste and inefficiency has released hundreds of millions of pounds for better patient care. The sale of property which the NHS no longer needs - for example, because of new hospital developments is currently raising £200 million a year for better health care.  We will continue to ensure that the Health Service is as efficient as possible.  But good management is not just a matter of efficiency. We value enterprise in the public service just as much as in the private sector. We will continue to encourage district and regional managers to devise new ways of providing better patient care.  Finally, the ultimate purpose of the Health Service is to serve the patient: that principle is at the heart of the Government's policy.  The time some patients have to wait for treatment is the most widespread concern in the NHS. The Government has given priority to reducing waiting lists and times. We have set up a special £50 million two-year programme. This year it will give treatment to over 100,000 people who are waiting for operations. We have set targets for more hip operations for old people, and more bone marrow transplants for children.  Putting patients first was the theme of our consultative document on primary care. We want the patient to have more information about services available from family doctors so that they can make a more informed choice.  Social Security - a Fair Deal for Those in Need  We are spending about £46 billion this year on social security benefits over £800 a year for every man, woman and child in the country. Expenditure on pensions and other benefits has risen by £13 billion on top of inflation, since we came into office. Most of this, an extra £9 billion, has gone to provide better standards of help and support to more elderly people, families with children, disabled people and those suffering long-term illness. The other £4 billion has gone to help the unemployed. But we have done more than provide extra resources massive as the increase has been.  For the first time for 40 years the Government has undertaken an overall review of the social security system. The review showed a social security system which was too complex and which too often did not provide help for those most in need. The 1986 Social Security Act tackled these problems and reformed the position so that the system is simpler to understand and to run. It will be fairer in the way it directs help to those who need it most. And it will be a system in which people can look forward to independence and security in retirement.  Our policies for social security have four main aims.  First, to ensure that those in retirement have a secure standard of living through state provision and their own pensions and savings.  This Government has honoured its pledges to the pensioner and more than maintained the buying power of the state pension. Total spending on state pensions and benefits for elderly people has risen by 29 per cent after allowing for inflation.  We will continue to maintain the value of the state retirement pension.  But retired people value their independence. They do not want to rely on the State alone for their income nor, increasingly, are they doing so. We share Beveridge's original goal of a good basic pension from the State, together with a second income from occupational and personal pensions and savings.  Pensioners have benefited from our success against inflation. Almost three-quarters of all pensioners have savings. Their income from these has grown by over 7 per cent on average every year since 1979. Income from savings fell by 3Y2 per cent every year under the last Labour Government, eaten away by inflation.  Occupational pensions, pensioners' savings, social security benefits and the state retirement pension have all increased. The total increase in income for the average pensioner is more than double that achieved during the last Labour Government.  We are now offering new opportunities for people to obtain additional pensions from their jobs or their own savings. We have already improved the treatment of those now retiring early and of the pension rights of people changing jobs.  We wish to encourage the 10 million employees who do not yet have their own occupational pension scheme to have a pension of their own. Every employee should have the right to take out a personal pension, fully portable from job to job. That is why we are extending favourable tax treatment from employers' schemes to personal pensions.  As a result of these reforms, millions more people will have the opportunity to take out additional pensions of their own.  In the next Parliament:  We will reintroduce measures to give substantial tax incentives to personal pensions, and to enable members of occupational schemes to make additional voluntary contributions to a pension plan that is completely separate from their employers' schemes. These measures will further increase choice for millions of employees.  Second, to bring more help to low income families.  Child benefit will continue to be paid as now, and direct to the mother. Families on income support which replaces supplementary benefit will benefit from the new family premium. In addition, we will introduce the new family credit which will benefit twice as many low income families in work as family income supplement. The new system will also help tackle both the unemployment and the poverty traps.  Third, to improve the framework of benefits for disabled people.  Spending on benefits for disabled people and those suffering long-term sickness has been increased by 72 per cent after inflation to £6 billion. The amount spent on mobility allowances has been doubled, invalid care allowance extended, the new severe disablement allowance introduced and the invalidity trap abolished. The introduction of the new disablement premiums will bring an extra £50 million per year to disabled people.  We are carrying out a major new survey of the needs of disabled people. This will be completed next year.  Fourth, to reform the tangled web of income-related benefits which has grown up piecemeal over forty years.  For the first time all the income-related benefits will be calculated in the same way. Where people are working, the amount of benefit they get will depend on their pay after tax and national insurance contributions. Thus people will not be made worse off by taking a job and will not lose money when their gross pay rises.  The new rules, which come into effect in April next year, will be easier for claimants to understand and staff to run. In addition, our programme of computerisation - the biggest programme ever in this country will help staff to deliver benefits to all who are entitled to them quickly, accurately and courteously.  Success in social policy depends on growth in national prosperity. Labour's economic failure led to damaging cuts in health care and benefits. Our increasing economic strength means that resources for care have grown and are growing - with programmes better managed, better adapted to changing demands, and better directed to those most in need.  FREEDOM, LAW AND RESPONSIBILITY  Conservatives have always believed that a fundamental purpose of government is to protect the security of the citizen under the rule of law. There can be no half-heartedness, no opting out, in the fight against crime and violence: all of us, not just the Government or the police, share a responsibility to make safer our streets and homes.  The Fight Against Crime  We do not underrate the challenge. Crime has been rising steadily over the years; not just in Britain but in most other countries, too. The origins of crime lie deep in society: in families where parents do not support or control their children; in schools where discipline is poor; and in the wider world where violence is glamorised and traditional values are under attack.  Government alone cannot tackle such deep-rooted problems easily or quickly. But Government must give a lead: by backing, not attacking the police; by providing a tough legal framework for sentencing; by building the prisons in which to place those who pose a threat to society - and by keeping out of prison those who do not; and by encouraging local communities to prevent crime and to help the police detect it. All this we have done; and we will intensify these efforts.  - The manpower available to the police has been increased by 16,500 since 1979.  - We have given the police more powers to avert public disorder.  - We have encouraged tougher sentences for violent criminals. The maximum penalties for trafficking in hard drugs and for attempted rape have been raised to life imprisonment. The courts have been empowered to strip drug traffickers of their profits.  - We have brought forward a number of reforms to help tackle child abuse and make it more likely that offenders will be successfully prosecuted.  - We have embarked on the biggest prison building and modernisation programme this century and increased staff numbers by almost a fifth.  Care for the Innocent  At the same time we have extended protection for innocent people and for the victims of crime.  - We have strengthened the safeguards against any abuse of police power by setting up an independent police Complaints Authority, providing for the tape-recording of police interviews and setting down clear rules on the proper treatment of the individual citizen.  - We have given special priority to helping the victims of crime. Police treatment of rape victims has been made more sensitive. More criminals now pay compensation to their victims. We are providing more money to help local Victim Support Schemes.  - We have launched a determined drive to improve the administration of justice by providing for time limits by which the cases of those held in custody must be heard. 58 more Circuit Judges have been appointed and 43 court building projects have been completed.  Better Justice  The challenge before us remains great; but much has been done. The great majority of those who commit serious crimes of violence are brought to book. There are more police, better equipped to fight crime. Those who commit serious crimes can now expect much tougher punishment.  Early in the new Parliament the Criminal Justice Bill will have to be reintroduced. It will:  - enable child victims of physical and sexual abuse to give evidence by a live video link n order to reduce the anguish which they would otherwise face;  - raise to life imprisonment the penalty for carrying firearms while committing a crime;  - tackle, by providing for reference to the Court of Appeal, the problem of lenient sentences which undermine public confidence in the criminal justice system;  - give victims of crime a statutory right to compensation under the Criminal Injuries Compensation Scheme;  - build on our previous measures stripping drug traffickers of the proceeds of their crimes and extend the same approach to other serious crimes.  We have already signed an extradition treaty with the United States which will make it more difficult for terrorists to escape British justice: now we will reform our own law on extradition so as to make still more effective the international war against crime.  Building on Strength  We will continue to put a high priority on the fight against crime, so that the citizen can feel safe on the street or in his home.  We will:  - increase the number of police further to ensure a stronger police presence on our streets, to combat crime and to protect the public;  - strengthen the law dealing with the sale and possession of offensive weapons;  - maintain the operational independence of the police and resist pressure from the Opposition parties to politicise the police by letting local authorities decide policing priorities;  - continue our present prison building programme and achieve more professional and efficient working practices in the prison service;  - institute a thorough review of the workings of the parole system.  Our approach in all these cases is strongly supported by the general public. We will go further in drawing on that support by promoting crime prevention. Already more than 29,000 Neighbourhood Watch Schemes have sprung up since the last Election. We are committed to the success of this popular anti-crime movement.  We will build on the support of the public by establishing a national organisation to promote the best practices in local crime prevention initiatives.  We will seek ways to strengthen the special constabulary.  Tackling Drug Abuse  We have taken the battle against drugs into every corner of the globe where production or trafficking flourishes. We have more than doubled the number of customs specialist drug investigators. We have strengthened the effectiveness of the police in the fight against drug abuse. Traffickers can now be sentenced to life imprisonment. They also stand to lose all the wealth generated by their evil trade under the most far-reaching asset seizure provisions anywhere in the world.  We have funded about 200 new drug treatment facilities. Our prevention campaign, targeted on youngsters at risk, is encouraging a strong resistance to hard drugs amongst teenagers.  The battle against drugs can and must be won. Already there are some signs that the heroin problem may have passed its peak. The cocaine explosion has never happened. It need never happen.  We will continue to make the defeat of the drug trade a key priority.  Immigration and Race Relations  Immigration for settlement is now at its lowest level since control of Commonwealth immigration first began in 1962. Firm but fair immigration controls are essential for harmonious and improving community relations.  We will tighten the existing law to ensure that the control over settlement becomes even more effective.  We now require visas for visitors from the Indian sub-continent, Nigeria and Ghana, both to protect genuine travellers and to guard against bogus visitors seeking to settle here illegally. We are tackling the problem of those who fraudulently pose as refugees and who seek to exploit Britain's long tradition of giving refuse to the victims of persecution.  We want to see members of the ethnic minorities assuming positions of leadership alongside their fellow citizens and accepting their full share of responsibility. Racial discrimination is an injustice and can have no place in a tolerant and civilised society. We are particularly concerned about racial attacks. They require effective and sympathetic attention from the police and we have ensured that increasingly they receive it.  Progress towards better community relations must be on a basis of equality. Reverse discrimination is itself an injustice and if it were to be introduced it would undermine the achievement and example of those who had risen on their merits.  Immigrant communities have already shown that it is possible to play an active and influential role in the mainstream of British life without losing one's distinctive cultural traditions. We also want to see all ethnic minorities participating fully in British culture. They will suffer permanent disadvantage if they remain in linguistic and cultural ghettos.  Reforming the Law  Since the last election the Government has made a number of important reforms of family law. These cover the law of maintenance and distribution of property following divorce, measures to prevent the abduction of children and the law of illegitimacy.  Particular laws which are not enforced or which are full of obvious anomalies risk bringing the law itself into disrepute. Changing tastes also require the reform of outdated laws which govern personal habits and behaviour: such reform should where possible be on the basis of a wide consensus.  The present laws on Sunday trading and licensing contain innumerable anomalies. They are frequently flouted.  We will therefore look for an acceptable way forward to bring sense and consistency to the law on Sunday trading.  And we will liberalise the laws on liquor licensing hours so as to increase consumer choice, but we will also keep a sensible limit on late-night opening.  We have already extended absent voting rights to new categories of electors. In particular we have enfranchised British citizens who have lived abroad for less than 5 years.  We propose to extend this eligibility.  Northern Ireland  The British people have shown their commitment to the people of Northern Ireland in the common fight against terrorism, and in helping improve the economic and social situation in the Province. We resolutely support the security forces in their outstanding service to the whole community.  We are determined that terrorism will not succeed; that the vital principles of democracy will be upheld; and that the people of Northern Ireland themselves should determine their constitutional position.  We will maintain, against Socialist opposition, for as long as is necessary the special powers which the police need throughout the UK to prevent terrorism and bring terrorists to justice.  There will be no change in the present status of Northern Ireland as part of the United Kingdom unless the people of Northern Ireland so wish it.  That is at the heart of the Anglo-Irish Agreement which was signed with the Republic of Ireland in 1985. The Agreement offers reassurance to both sides of the community that their identities and interests will be respected, and that any change in the status of Northern Ireland would only come about with the consent of a majority of the people of the Province. It commits both governments to work together in the fight against terrorism.  We will continue to work within the Province for a devolved government in which both communities can have confidence and will feel able to participate.  LOCAL GOVERNMENT AND INNER CITIES  The Conservative view of local government is that local people should look after the interests of the local community which they were elected to serve, maintaining and improving essential services at a price people can afford. That is an honourable tradition of public service, still upheld by councillors in most local authorities.  But the abuses of left-wing Labour councils have shocked the nation. The Labour Party leadership pretends that this is a problem in only a few London boroughs. The truth is that the far Left control town halls in many of our cities.  The extremists have gained power in these areas partly because too few ratepayers have an interest in voting for responsible councillors pursuing sensible policies. Many people benefit from local services yet make little or no contribution towards them: this throws too heavy a burden on too few shoulders.  There is much else wrong with the present system of domestic rates. They seem unfair and arbitrary. And companies are left with little protection against huge rate rises levied by councils controlled by Labour, Liberals and Social Democrats, which drive them out of business and destroy jobs.  We have acted to protect ratepayers' interests in a number of ways. The wasteful and unnecessary tier of the GLC and metropolitan counties has been eliminated - to the substantial benefit of ratepayers. Our rate-capping legislation so bitterly opposed by the Labour, SDP and Liberal parties in Parliament has protected ratepayers from huge rate increases. This year alone, twenty councils will be rate-capped nineteen of them Labour and one controlled by the Liberals and the SDP saving ratepayers several hundred million pounds.  We will now tackle the roots of the problem. We will reform local government finance to strengthen local democracy and accountability.  Local electors must be able to decide the level of service they want and how much they are prepared to pay for it.  We will legislate in the first Session of the new Parliament to abolish the unfair domestic rating system and replace rates with a fairer Community Charge.  This will be a fixed rate charge for local services paid by those over the age of 18, except the mentally ill and elderly people living in homes and hospitals. The less-well-off and students will not have to pay the full charge but everyone will be aware of the costs as well as the benefits of local services. This should encourage people to take a greater interest in the policies of their local council and in getting value for money. Business ratepayers will pay a Unified Business Rate at a standard rate pegged to inflation.  We will require local authorities to put out to tender a range of services, including refuse collection, the cleaning of streets and buildings, vehicle maintenance, catering and ground maintenance.  Ratepayers expect councils to provide their services as efficiently as possible. Yet some local authorities steadfastly oppose private sector companies tendering for services even though they could provide them more cheaply and effectively. The independent Audit Commission has estimated that some £500 million a year could be saved if all councils followed the practices of the best sums which could be used to lower rates or improve services.  The Widdicombe Report into the conduct of local authority business painted a disturbing picture of the breakdown of democratic processes in a number of councils. We will take action to strengthen democratic processes in local authorities.  Inner Cities  The regeneration of the inner cities must be tackled. The growth in our national prosperity in recent years has been founded on a rebirth of enterprise. But in many of our inner cities the conditions for enterprise and pride of ownership have been systematically extinguished by Socialist councils. For the sake of those living in our inner cities we must remove the barriers against private investment, jobs and prosperity which such councils have erected.  We are setting up five new Urban Development Corporations which will have the powers, resources and management structure to reclaim and redevelop great tracts of derelict land: these new Corporations will follow the model successfully applied in London Docklands and on Merseyside.  Our Unified Business Rate will ensure that companies and jobs are not driven out of inner city areas by the high rates of profligate councils.  We have roughly doubled the resources to reclaim derelict land. We will improve procedures to accelerate the process of bringing vacant and under-used public sector land back into productive use.  We will build on the experience of Urban Development Corporations by creating new mini-UDCs. These will operate on a smaller scale in areas where there is clear economic potential but where the local authorities are failing to tackle the problem.  Our Urban Programme provides a range of grants to help industry and local councils undertake projects that will improve the environment and encourage new investment.  We are helping to lead local action through our five City Action Teams, sixteen Inner City Task Forces and the Inner City Partnerships. All of them draw on government assistance and work with local business and local people to promote enterprise, employment and training.  Great cities are built on the enterprise and vitality of the individuals who live there. Our aim is to create a climate which encourages and harnesses that energy in the interests of all.  A BETTER SOCIETY  Planning and the Environment  Conservatives are by instinct conservationists - committed to preserve all that is best of our country's past. We are determined to maintain our national heritage of countryside and architecture. Since taking office we have:  - more than doubled the area of specially protected Green Belt: we will continue to defend it against unsuitable development;  - established new arrangements, backed with public funds, to make farming more sensitive to wildlife and to conservation;  - completed the work of listing pre-war buildings which receive legal protection and extended such protection to the best post-war buildings;  - established a new, powerful Pollution Inspectorate;  - passed new laws on the control of pesticides and implemented new controls on the pollution of water;  - put in hand plans for cleaning up Britain's beaches, costing over £300 million over the next four years;  - more than doubled spending after allowing for inflation on countryside and nature conservation since 1979;  - set in hand the establishment of the new Norfolk Broads Authority - a major environmental initiative;  - established a huge programme, costing over £4,000 million, to clean up the environment of the Mersey Basin by the early years of the next century.  We are determined to maintain the Green Belt. We will protect the countryside for its own sake and conserve its wildlife, while allowing for those small scale and well planned developments which are needed to provide jobs and keep country areas thriving.  Wherever possible we want to encourage large-scale developments to take place on unused and neglected land in our towns and cities rather than in the countryside. We want to improve on our performance in 1986 when nearly half of all new development took place on reused land.  A Practical Agenda  Only the Conservatives have a serious costed agenda for further environmental action for another five years of Government. We will:  - continue our £600 million programme of modifying power stations, to combat acid rain;  - adopt improved standards, in concert with Europe, for reducing pollution from cars. We have already reduced tax on lead-free petrol and will encourage its wider use;  - introduce new laws on air pollution and dangerous wastes;  - double the funding for Environmentally Sensitive Areas;  - introduce new laws giving extra protection to the landscape of our National Parks;  - encourage more small woodlands in lowland areas through new grants;  - legislate to safeguard common land on the basis of the Common Land Forum, and continue to protect public access to the countryside through footpaths;  - support scientifically justified, international action to protect the atmosphere and the sea from damage from pollutants;  - establish a National Rivers Authority to take over responsibilities for ensuring strict safeguards against the pollution of rivers and water courses and to pursue sound conservation policies. The water supply and sewage functions of the water authorities will be transferred to the private sector;  - set up safe facilities for disposing of radioactive waste from power stations, hospitals and other sources: we have asked UK NIREX to come forward with proposals for deep disposal.  THE ARTS  Our international reputation in the arts has never been higher. Tourists flock to this country to enjoy the highest standards of theatre, music, artistic excellence and our museums. Art centres have nearly doubled in number since 1979. Attendances at theatres, concerts, cinemas and historic houses have all risen significantly.  Under the Conservatives, spending on the arts has risen by 15 per cent since 1979 after allowing for inflation. Over the same period, the Arts Council grant has risen from £61 million to nearly £139 million. And schemes like the Business Sponsorship Incentive Scheme have pushed the value of such sponsorship from £72 million to £25 million over the last decade.  In future years:  - We will maintain government support for the arts and continue to encourage private support.  - We will make it a major objective to ensure that excellence in the arts is available in all parts of the country.  - We will continue to safeguard our heritage, particularly through the National Heritage Memorial Fund, created by this Government in 1980 to assist the preservation, maintenance and acquisition of items of outstanding merit which might otherwise be lost to the nation.  - We will encourage our great national museums and galleries to make the national treasures which they house more widely accessible.  Sport  We have increased funding for the Sports Council from £15 million in 1978/79 to £37 million in 1987/88.  We will continue to work with the Council and, through our funding of the Sports Council National Centres, we will encourage the pursuit of excellence in our sports.  We want to encourage competitive sports through schools and clubs and we strongly oppose any attempts to ban competitive sports in schools.  We will continue to encourage schools and colleges to open their facilities for community use wherever possible to co-operate with other owners to achieve public access to sport premises.  Football hooliganism has tarnished the good name of British sportsmanship. We have acted to control the sale of alcohol at sports grounds. We have enhanced police powers to stop and search at football grounds and we have encouraged tougher sentencing of hooligans.  Broadcasting  Our objectives for broadcasting are to provide consumers with a wider range of programmes, to encourage independent producers, and to preserve the high standards which we have traditionally enjoyed in British broadcasting.  Vital decisions will need to be made in the next Parliament. We have already published proposals for a less regulated and more diverse radio system. We shall follow a policy of more competition, variety and innovation in our domestic networks and encourage the export of British programmes to international audiences and markets. The development of the broadcasting industry will be allowed to occur, wherever possible, commercially.  We will therefore introduce a major new Broadcasting Bill in the new Parliament. It will enable the broadcasters to take full advantage of the opportunities presented by technological advances and to broaden the choice of viewing and listening.  The broadcasters owe it to the lively talent in the independent sector to take more programmes from them.  We will ensure that at least 25 per cent of programmes broadcast on both ITV and BBC will be supplied by independent producers as soon as possible.  The responsibility for enforcing broadcasting standards must rest with the broadcasting authorities. The present Broadcasting Complaints Commission has a relatively narrow remit. But there is deep public concern over the display of sex and violence on television. We will therefore bring forward proposals for stronger and more effective arrangements to reflect that concern.  We will remove the current exemption enjoyed by broadcasters under the Obscene Publications Act 1959.  BRITAIN AND THE WORLD  Britain is once again giving a lead in world affairs. We are forthright in support of freedom and justice. We stand up vigorously for Britain's interests abroad. Our voice is heard with respect on the crucial issues of war and peace, of finance and trade.  Defending the Nation  The first duty of government is the defence of the realm and the preservation of peace. Nuclear weapons are vital to that task. In the 40 years since 1945, more than 10 million people have died in wars around the globe. But there has been peace in Europe.  Conventional weapons did not succeed in deterring war. But nuclear weapons have prevented, not only nuclear war, but conventional war in Europe as well. A strong defence policy has proved to be the most effective peace policy.  Labour's policy is to give up Britain's independent nuclear deterrent without asking anything in return. The Labour Party would require the United States to withdraw its nuclear weapons from our soil and to close down NATO nuclear bases in Britain. It would remove Britain altogether from the protection of the United States' nuclear umbrella.  That policy would abandon the defence policy followed by every British government, Labour or Conservative, since the Second World War. It would expose us to nuclear blackmail from the vast Soviet armoury, to which we would have no reply. It would inflict damage, perhaps fatal damage, on the Atlantic Alliance on which we and Western Europe depend for our security. It would strike at our relations with our most important ally, weakening the American commitment to Europe's defences. It would, in short, be the biggest victory for the Soviet Union in 40 years.  The defence policy of the Liberals and Social Democrats is muddled and confused. They would cancel Trident and they have no clear idea of what to put in its place. Their suggested replacements are much more expensive than Trident, which costs only 3p in every £ of defence spending. None would be available in time. None would provide equal security.  The Liberal and SDP defence policy would be one-sided disarmament by default or inadvertence. The only difference between it and Labour policy is a matter of timing. Labour would scrap Britain's deterrent immediately upon entering office. The Liberals and Social Democrats would allow it to wither on the vine.  Only the Conservative Party stands by the defence policy which every post-war government has seen to be necessary and which has kept the peace of Europe for more than a generation. We are not prepared to take risks with Britain's security:  - We will stand fully by our obligations to our European and American allies in NATO.  - We will retain our independent nuclear deterrent and modernise it with Trident. Because of improvements in Soviet defences we need the greater capability of Trident to retain the necessary deterrence which Polaris gives. No amount of money spent on conventional defence would ever buy us the same degree of deterrence.  - We will continue to increase the effectiveness of our conventional forces, to provide them with the most modern equipment and to obtain better value for money from the defence budget. We have already increased defence spending by more than 20 per cent in real terms since 1979 and restored the pay and conditions of our servicemen.  But we also want to see a world in which there are fewer nuclear weapons. That is why Britain is at the forefront of arms control negotiations.  We strive with our allies to achieve balanced and verifiable agreements for:  - the elimination of medium-range nuclear missiles in Europe and preferably world-wide;  - agreed constraints on shorter-range missiles;  - a 50 per cent cut in strategic nuclear missiles;  - and a world-wide ban on chemical weapons.  Western strength and resolution are essential to achieve these aims. That is why the Conservative Government deployed Cruise missiles. All the Opposition parties - Labour, Liberals and SDP - voted against deployment in the House of Commons. Yet it was the deployment of Cruise and Pershing missiles which brought the Soviet Union back to the negotiating table. We can look forward to an agreement this year which will, for the first time, reduce the numbers of nuclear weapons.  With the Conservatives Britain is also taking the lead in working towards greater trust and confidence between East and West, and to encourage changes in the East, where disillusion with totalitarian Socialism grows inexorably. The Prime Minister's historic visit to Moscow was a major contribution to this. We shall welcome any move by the Soviet Union towards respect for basic human rights. But we must not lower our guard. Strong defence is still the surest foundation for building peace.  Europe Grows in Strength  This Government has taken Britain from the sidelines into the mainstream of Europe. But being good Europeans does not prevent us from standing up for British interests. The agreement we negotiated on the Community Budget has saved Britain £4,500 million since 1984.  We will continue to work for strict controls on the Community Budget.  Britain has led the way in establishing a genuine common market, with more trade and services moving freely across national boundaries.  We will campaign for the opening of the market in financial and other services and the extension of cheaper air fares in Europe.  We will also continue to work with our European partners to defend our own trading interests and press for freer trade among all nations.  All of this will help safeguard existing jobs and create new ones.  We will continue to play a responsible leading role in the development of the Community, while safeguarding our essential national interests.  Firm Against Terrorism and Aggression  Britain has stood at the forefront in the fight against international terrorism. No democracy has a better record than Britain in standing up to the terrorists, who threaten the most basic values of civilised life.  We will seek the support of other democratic nations for the provisions of the European Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism.  We stood up to aggression in the Falklands and would do so again, if necessary. We want normal relations with Argentina. We have made numerous proposals to that end. But we stand by our pledges to the Islanders. We will not negotiate on the sovereignty of the Falklands.  The Wider World  When other countries are prepared to act in good faith, the Conservative Government has shown the will and the diplomatic skill to find solutions to age-old conflicts and misunderstandings. Our record of tackling long-standing problems in Hong Kong, Zimbabwe and Gibraltar demonstrates our determination to seek peaceful and imaginative settlements of difficult international disputes. We have played a prominent part in bringing Israel and the moderate Arab states closer to peace negotiations in the framework of an international conference.  We believe that the issues of Southern Africa, too, will be tackled best by dialogue, not violence. We want to see an end to apartheid in South Africa. But trade and economic sanctions would only serve to entrench apartheid, increase the risk of bloodshed and inflict severe hardship on black South Africans without bringing a settlement any nearer. Negotiations between the leaders of the South African people are the best way to resolve the problems of that unhappy country.  Overseas Aid  We have the sixth largest aid programme in the western world, and the third largest in Europe, spending about £1,300 million each year. Britain pioneered the reform of Europe's food aid policy, to make it more rapid and effective. We have substantially increased our support for the disaster, famine and refugee relief activities of voluntary agencies, as well as for their long-term development work. We have led the way in giving help to the people of Ethiopia, ravaged by famine. Our ""Aid and Trade Provision"" funds have helped win good development contracts for British firms worth over £2 billion since 1979.  We will maintain our substantial aid programme and direct it ever more effectively.  We will bring more young people from Commonwealth and other countries to train and study in Britain.  We ourselves have made positive and practical proposals for international action to help some of the poorest and most indebted countries of sub-Saharan Africa.  Labour's proposal of selective import controls would damage developing countries, open the door to protectionism and harm those poorest countries which most need our help. It would also be bad for Britain. The best contribution Britain can make to developing countries is to champion open trade and free enterprise abroad and to practise them at home.  A Fateful Choice  For decades there was basic agreement between political parties on defence and foreign policy. That agreement was firmly in the national interest. It has been torn up by our opponents.  Labour's policy would mean not a secure Britain, but a neutralist Britain. And eventually for there can be no trifling with Soviet power a frightened and fellow-travelling Britain.  The Liberals and Social Democrats would take us more slowly down that same disastrous road.  This election matters more for our safety and freedom than any election since the Second World War.  CONCLUSION: THE WAY FORWARD  The proposals outlined in this manifesto are the extension of policies which have already proved outstandingly successful.  Today Britain is a stable and well-governed country which exercises great influence in the world.  We seek the support of the British people to make this achievement truly secure, to build upon it and to extend its benefits to all.  No previous government with eight years of office to its credit has ever presented the electorate with such a full programme of radical reform.  No other party, presenting its manifesto proposals to the nation, has been able to support them with such a solid record of achievement.  We commend them with confidence to the British people."
"Labour",199204,"It's time to get Britain working again  WINTER ENDING 'A cold coming we had of it' huddled together in cardboard cities, crouched over shared books in leaking classrooms, crammed into peeling waiting-rooms, ice stamped into crazy-paving round polluted streams. Winter ending: paintings, poems bud hesitantly, tentative chords behind boarded facades; factories open like daffodils, trains flex frozen rheumatic joints, computer-screens blink on in the sudden daylight. As the last cardboard boxes are swept away beneath busy bridges, the cold blue landscape of winter suddenly alive with bright red roses.  Adrian Henri March 1992  Contents  Foreword by the Rt. Hon. Neil Kinnock Leader of the Labour Party 1. Immediate action for national recovery 2. Building a strong economy 3. Modernising the National Health Service 4. Raising standards in our schools 5. The best future for families 6. A modern democracy 7. Britain in a new world  FOREWORD BY THE RT. HON. NEIL KINNOCK LEADER OF THE LABOUR PARTY  This general election is a choice between a Conservative government paralysed by recession, and a Labour government determined to get on with building recovery. Gripped by the longest recession since the war, Britain needs a government with a clear sense of direction and purpose. A government with the people and the policies to get Britain working again and to achieve sustained recovery - strength with staying power. Labour will be such a government. But this election is not only a choice between policies, important though both are. It is also a choice between values. At the core of our convictions is belief in individual liberty. We therefore believe: First, that for liberty to have real meaning the standards of community provision must be high and access to that provision must be wide. Second, that those rights of the individual must, like all others in a free society, belong to all men and women of every age, class and ethnic origin and be balanced by responsibilities of fair contribution and law-abiding conduct. Third, that for rights and responsibilities to be exercised fully and fairly, government in Britain as in other industrialised democracies, must work to build prosperity by properly supporting research, innovation, the improvement of skills, the infrastructure and long-term industrial development. Our vision for Britain is founded on these values. Guided by them, we will make our country more competitive, creative, and just; more secure against crime, aggression and environmental danger. We want government to serve the whole nation - using its power to realise this vision. Labour will be such a government. These are our convictions and we will work to fulfil them. They are also down-to-earth aims - essential objectives in a country hit by recession, suffering run-down public services and facing the intensifying pressures of European and global economic competition. Ml of those realities require that the government provides: a stable economic environment; education and training that fosters the abilities of all young people and adults; a firm emphasis on productive investment in both the public and private sectors. Labour will implement and maintain those policies. They are vital for prosperity, for consistently low inflation and for continuous improvement in economic performance and living standards. They are also fundamental to improving the quality and quantity of provision in health and social services, and to combating poverty We have absolute commitment to a high-quality National Health Service, free at time of need and not fractured and weakened by underfunding and a commercialised contract system. We will get on with fulfilling that commitment from the moment of our election - by strengthening and modernising the NHS, by extending care in the community and by establishing the National Health Initiative to prevent illness. Our pledges to increase the income of pensioners and families with children will urgently be fulfilled. Our undertakings to stop the perpetual experiments in schools and to raise standards of investment and achievement in education will be kept in full. These policies - like those to increase house-building, improve transport and protect the environment - are not only important to the well-being of the British people now. They are vital preparations for the future. In that future, we are determined that Britain will be a leader in the New Europe, setting higher standards and not surrendering influence by opting out. We have confidence in our country and in the qualities and potential of its people. We want to nourish their artistic, scientific, sporting and other abilities. And we want to enhance their democratic power too. We shall therefore make constitutional and other changes that will give renewed vitality to our democracy We shall empower people as citizens and as consumers of public and private services. We will strengthen equality before the law and equality of opportunity for the majority of the population -women. Neither their legal status nor their chances in education, training and employment are full or free. We will ensure that the barriers to fairness are removed. These policies, like many others, manifest our practical commitment to freedom. That purpose is not confined to the shores of our country. In an age where liberty has made great advances in the world, there is still conflict, instability and want, causing great misery and inhibiting the peace and co-operation which we want to help to build. We shall, therefore ensure that our country has the defence capacity, the strength of alliance and the peace-making commitment necessary to safeguard the United Kingdom, to participate in international negotiations for disarmament, to deter aggression and to contribute to constructing a New World Order, now feasible through the strengthened United Nations. In our relations with the new democracies of Central and Eastern Europe as well as with the poverty-stricken peoples of the South, we will work from the principle that political freedom needs the sure foundation of economic security. In this increasingly inter-dependent world there are no distant crises. The Labour government will therefore, as a matter of moral obligation and in the material interests of our country, foster the development and trade relationships necessary for the advance of economic security, political democracy and respect for human rights. The United Kingdom has been through 13 years in which unemployment has more than doubled, irreplaceable assets have been wasted, markets at home and abroad have been lost, manufacturing investment has fallen, poverty has increased, the crime rate has rocketed, and talents have been neglected. Now our country faces clear alternatives. A Conservative government would mean a repeat of the same, stale policies which brought economic insecurity, privatised and underfunded public services and increased social division. The Conservatives have no policies which would mean sustained recovery, higher health care or improved educational standards. The arrogance remains which brought us the poll tax, centralisation in Britain and isolation in Europe. If they can't get it right in 13 years, they never will. The Labour government will mean a fresh start for Britain. It will mean strong and continued emphasis on investment for economic strength. It will mean action to help families, fair taxation, incentives for enterprise and support for essential community services. It will mean greater freedom, securitv and opportunity. It will mean change for the better. It's time to make that change. It's time for Labour.  Immediate action for national recovery  Britain faces a huge task of national reconstruction. From day one, the new government must start to get Britain working again. It must get the economy out of recession, it must lay foundations for the future. Recovery must be based on investment, for only investment will create lasting prosperity.  Today. millions of people fear losing their job, their home or their business. The new Labour government's National Recovery Programme will start to remove that fear with immediate action on investment. jobs and training. It will combat recession now and build sustained and sustainable recovery for the future.  Britain's economic problems are deep-seated. We will not be able to do at once everything that we would like to do. But we will get down to business right away. And as with any properly-run business. our immediate programme will be part of a strategy for long-term success.  ACTION FOR INDUSTRY 1 We will provide enhanced capital allowances to encourage companies immediately to bring forward manufacturing investment in new machinery and plant, innovation and design. This will last for a limited period. 2. We will introducc an investment tax incentive tailored to the special needs of small businesses. 3. We will immediately begin the phased release of receipts from the sale of council houses land and property receipts to allow local authorities to build new homes and improve old ones. More building workers in the recession-savaged construction and building supply industries will be employed and more families rehoused. Equivalent arrangements will be made in Scotland. 4. We will allow British Rail to proceed with a leasing scheme of 188 new Networker trains on the North Kent line - the first step in securing private investment to help modernise Britain's railways and protect our environment. ACTION FOR JOBS 5. Housing investment will generate jobs. We will also establish a work programme combining three days a week work for the unemployed - paid at the proper rate - with two days' training and job seeking. This will benefit the community and ensure that unemployed people are offered a range of employment and training opportunities. The programme which can be quickly and easily established will allow us to start bringing down unemployment immediately. Our aim is to prevent long-term unemployment rather than just trying to cope with it after it has occurred ACTION FOR SKILLS AND SCHOOLS 6. We will restore last year's training cuts which caused so much damage to training for young people and the unemployed. We will establish a new cash-limited Skills for the 90s fund with an initial budget of £300 million, to upgrade the training of those in work. Investment will be targeted particularly at areas of skill shortages and will give people who are now unskilled the chance to acquire basic skills. 7. Over the next 22 months, additional resources of at least £600 million will be available for investment in education. Amongst other projects, this will help to tackle equipment shortages and the backlog of school repairs. ACTION FOR THE NHS Over the next 22 months. additional at least £1 billion will be available for investment in the National Health Service. This will help the NHS to make real advances in care and treatment. ACTION FOR CHILDREN 9. We will start to increase nursery education places for three and four year olds by making sure that local councils actually use the money they receive for nursery education to create new places and by switching capital funds earmarked for the City Technology College programmes. This will lead to the rapid creation of 25,000 new places. 10. We will extend the exemption from tax which applies to workplace nurseries to all forms of employer assistance with childcare. GETTING RESULTS Every action we propose makes sense by itself. Together our proposals add up to a co-ordinated programme for recovery. By investing in house-building and repairs, we start to rehouse homeless people. By investing in public transport, we start to transform commuters' lives and create a cleaner environment. By investing in the NHS, we offer new security to the patients and the public. By investing in education we nourish the talents of children and lay the basis for future success. With each step we employ more workers in industries from construction and computer software to high-tech engineering printing and publishing. We enable businesses to thrive. We save taxpayers' money on benefits. We transform unemployment claimants into employed contributors. Labour's programme for national recovery will this year help bring Britain out of recession. Public investment will modernise services help business and industry and stimulate private investment. It will make you and your family better off.  Building a strong economy  Labour's economic policy rests on one simple, commonsense fact. The only way for Britain to build a strong economy is to make the goods and services which people at home and abroad want to buy  Britain is in a race for economic survival and success. Faced with intense competition, companies and countries can succeed only by constantly improving their performance. Every employee in every enterprise must be involved in a new partnership so that trained and talented people can use the most modern technologies to create top-quality products. But none of this will happen with a government that believes that the best thing is to do nothing. Three thousand men and women have lost their jobs on every working day since John Major became Prime Minister. Every week 900 businesses go bankrupt. Every dav 200 families lose their homes.  The Conservatives have created the longest recession for 60 years. They have no idea how to get us out of it and even less idea how to stay out of it. Britain needs a Labour government which will back British industry in the way our competitors back theirs.  A GOVERNMENT WHICH BUSINESS CAN DO BUSINESS WITH  Modern government has a strategic role not to replace the market but to ensure that the market works properly. Other competitors in Europe and elsewhere recognise that industrial policy must be at the heart of economic policy. It is the government's responsibility to create the conditions for enterprise to thrive. Business needs sustained and balanced growth, with stable exchange rates, steady and competitive interest rates and low inflation. We will deliver them. Business must have a high level of education science and skills. Incentives for high-tech investment. Modern transport. Strong regional economies for new developments. We will deliver them.  WE WILL KEEP PRICES DOWN  Inflation has been suppressed by recession. But it has not been cured. To curb inflation. Labour will maintain the value of the pound within the European Exchange Rate Mechanism. We will manage credit sensibly. We will stop excessive price rises in water, electricity, telephones, transport and NHS prescriptions. The only way to defeat inflation in the medium term is to raise productivity substantially. By promoting investment and improving skills we will tackle the underlying causes of inflation.  WE WILL INTRODUCE FAIR TAXES  Attacking poverty is an essential component of Labour's programme for national recovery and prosperity. The most effective way to reduce poverty quickly is to increase child benefit and pensions and take low-paid people out of taxation. To achieve these goals, we will reform the national insurance and income tax system. We will increase child benefit to £9.95 a week for all children with the full value going to every family. This measure will benefit seven million families and is worth £127.40 a year to a family with two children. We will increase the basic retirement pension by an extra £5 a week for a single person and £8 for a married couple. All pensioners will receive the full increase which will also go to widows and others on benefits linked by statute to the basic pension level. Twelve million people will benefit. We will abolish the two per cent national insurance contribution on earnings under £54 a week - effectively a £56 annual entry fee into the national insurance system. At present employees earning less than £405 a week pay contributions on all their earnings, while above that level no contributions are paid at all. This is an unfair anomaly in our tax structure. The ceiling on contributions will therefore be abolished. We will take 740,000 taxpayers out of taxation altogether by increasing the personal allowance and wife's earned income allowance by more than inflation. Married couples will have the option of splitting the married couple's allowance between them as they choose. The basic rate of tax will remain unchanged at 25 per cent, as will the 40 per cent rate. A new top rate income tax of 50 per cent will apply to individuals with an income of at least £40,000 this year. Labour's tax and benefit changes are self-financing. They are fair. And they will make every individual employee on earnings up to at least £22,000 a year better off.  WE WILL REFORM DECISION-MAKING  Britain urgently needs a better way of making economic decisions. Government must decide at the same time how much to spend and how to pay for spending. The Budget should decide both. Every autumn, we will make a State of the Nation report on the British economy. Our national economic assessment will then allow employers, trade unions and other social partners to consider Britain's competitiveness and the competing claims on national output. These considerations will be an important influence on collective bargaining. In order to provide honest information about the state of the British economy, we will make the Central Statistical Office independent and free from political interference. We will halt the deterioration which has taken place in the pay and conditions of many public service workers - often through pay settlements which have been arbitrarily imposed upon them. We will seek fairer and more rational ways of determining public sector pay within clearly defined budget limits.  WE WILL CUT UNEMPLOYMENT  We are determined to make a swift reduction in unemployment and have explained in our NationaI Recovery Programme just how this will be done. It includes immediate action for unemployed people, as well as direct investment - for instance, in construction - to create thousands of new jobs. Steady and sustained economic growth will generate jobs that last. Better training will help people get back to work. Unemployment must be tackled by the European Community as a whole. We will use our influence in Europe to secure the necessary policies for co-ordinated growth.  WE WILL MODERNISE BRITAIN'S INDUSTRIES  It is time to rebuild Britain's industrial strength. For lasting recovery, Britain needs a modern industrial policy designed to build skills, upgrade technology, encourage industry in every region and expand exports. An Investment Decade for Britain will start with the immediate introduction of enhanced investment allowances (see page 9). We will help Britain's high-technology industries with a 25% tax credit for additional investment in research and development. Small firms will be assisted with a new investment scheme, combining a cash-limited fund for new investments with tax incentives tailored to heir special needs. Britain's industrial future depends on transforming our inventive genius into manufacturing strength. Labour will work with industry to establish British Technology Enterprise and create Technology Trusts throughout Britain, building bridges between industries and universities and helping firms turn good ideas into commercial products. We will encourage the development of the most modern telecommunications networks. Labour's Minister for Science will develop a national strategy to promote high-quality science and technology, so that Britain can better anticipate and respond to the challenges of the future. All over the world, industries face unprecedented environmental challenges. We will support new research into environmentally-friendly technologies and launch a Great Environment Exhibition to publicise and to promote sales of the cleanest British technologies.  WE WILL STRENGTHEN OUR REGIONAL ECONOMIES  We will establish new Regional Development Agencies in England, strengthen Scottish Enterprise and the Welsh Development Agency and modernise regional incentives. Regional agencies will become powerhouses for industrial development, encouraging investment, technology and skills. The Scottish Parliament will have a vital role in building the competitive strength of the Scottish economy. Our new Welsh Assembly will also have important economic responsibilities. Labour's National Investment Bank, operating on strictly commercial lines, will bring public and private sector together to invest in long-term regional and national infrastructure projects. Small and growing businesses will have a new deal. As well as the lowest possible interest rates, they need the backing on which their competitors can rely in France and Germany. Labour will establish a network of one-stop advice centres providing them with access to high-quality specialist assistance. We will give special attention to the establishment of small businesses by women, and members of the ethnic minority communities, who often face difficulties raising venture capital. Under the Conservatives, Britain has moved from manufacturing trade surplus to manufacturing trade deficit. The recent privatisation of the Export Credit Guarantee Department can only do further damage. Labour will create modern export services for the nation and the regions.  WE WILL INVEST IN MODERN TRANSPORT  Commuters and companies need fast, safe transport Labour will act to make sure they get it. It is absurd that French Railways can raise funds for new investment in the City of London, when British Rail is not allowed to do so. We will remove these restrictions. Leasing schemes will allow large-scale investments to be financed at relatively little cost to the public sector borrowing requirement. Private finance will also be mobilised for a high-speed rail network which will eventually link every region to the Channel Tunnel with proper environmental safeguards.  WE WILL IMPROVE ENERGY SUPPLIES  Families, commerce and industry need heat, light and power at prices they, can afford. Britain is well placed with reserves of coal, oil and gas which must be husbanded in a national energy policy to balance the needs of the present with those of the future. We will encourage enhanced recovery of oil from the North Sea and avoid becoming too dependent in on imported fuel. We will meet our international obligations to reduce harmful chimney emissions. We will restore public control of the National Grid and give it new duties and powers to ensure the long-term security of electricity supplies. We will secure the long-term future of the coal industry by reducing imports, stopping the 'dash for gas' and reining back on open-casting. We will retain the Department of Energy and move its petroleum engineering directorate to Aberdeen. We will require the energy companies to invest in R&D, and encourage the development of clean-burn coal technology.  WE WILL INVEST IN PEOPLE AT WORK  The key to a successful modern economy is a well-educated and motivated workforce. We cannot compete on the basis of low educational standards or poor working conditions. Britain's future must be high skill, high wage and high tech. Two things are needed: a training revolution to modernise people's skills, and rights for employees to fair treatment at work. We will offer unemployed people a range of employment and training opportunities. Our aim is to ensure that anyone who is unemployed for more than six months has a choice of job experience or training. We will also help the people often left out of good training opportunities, including the disabled, women returning after caring for children, and those with special educational needs. Expanded childcare will help women return to work and undertake training. A critical task is to upgrade the skills of people in work. Training and Enterprise Councils will be retained, reformed and made more broadly representative of their local communities and given stable budgets. Instead of the present series of piecemeal initiatives we will establish a coherent national training policy to meet the needs of industry and provide people with real equal opportunities at work. All employers, except for very small businesses, will be obliged to invest a minimum amount on training their workforce or make a contribution to the local or national training effort. Training will be a real partnership between government and industry, not an excuse to shift all the burden onto employers. We will transform the Careers Service to make careers advice available to everyone, young or old, employed or unemployed. Britain cannot get the best performance from our employees by giving them the worst treatment. There will be a fair framework of law for both employers and unions. There will be no return to the trade union legislation of the 1970s. Ballots before strikes and for union elections will stay. There will be no mass or flying pickets. But our individual employees are entitled to be treated at least as fairly as their colleagues in Europe. We will opt in to the Social Chapter of the new European Treaty and introduce employment standards common in successful economies, including the best health and safety legislation. The existing protection provided for people engaged in especially hazardous work will be retained. Women and men must be able to care for their family as well as earn a living. We will give all employees equal rights and status under the law, whether they are full-time or part-time, permanent or temporary. We aim to guarantee every woman in employment the right to 14 weeks' maternity leave on full pay, and to give fathers paternity leave, bringing Britain into line with the better provision elsewhere in the European Community. Employees will have new rights to be consulted and informed about decisions which affect them, as well as the right to union membership and representation. We will restore union rights at GCHQ. Anti-discrimination law will be strengthened and we will consider as part of that law outlawing discrimination in employment on the grounds of age. Britain's Wages Councils set minimum wages for about 2.5 million people. But there is no minimum wage for all employees. We will end the scandal of poverty pay and bring Britain into line with the rest of Europe by introducing a statutory minimum wage of £3.4O an hour. This is a major but long overdue reform which will benefit around four million low-paid people, 80 per cent of whom are women. We will consult widely to ensure smooth implementation.  WE WILL PROMOTE A STAKE FOR EMPLOYEES  Employees should have the opportunity to own collectively a significant stake in the company for which they work, through a democratic Employee Share Ownership Plan (ESOP) or a co-operative. We will strengthen support for such schemes and consult about the possibility of creating a new tax incentive to encourage companies to establish or extend an ESOP or set up a co-operative. Recent pension fund scandals have shown how right Labour has been to call for stronger legal protection. We will reform the law so that pension funds belong to their members, not to employers. Half of the pension trustees will be employees, with an independent chairman, and pensioners will be represented.  Modernising the National Health Service  This election will decide the future of the NHS. Indeed, it will decide whether or not we continue to have a NHS of the kind that the British people want. The Conservatives would continue to commercialise and privatise the NHS until it is run as just another business. With Labour, it will be modernised and restored as a high-quality public service, accountable to the community.  Labour will stop the privatisation of the NHS and return opted-out hospitals and other services to the local NHS. We will halt the commercial market which is creating a two-tier health service.  OUR COMMITMENT TO THE NHS  For a decade, the Conservatives have persistently underfunded the health service. It may well take at least the lifetime of a Parliament to put things right, but Labour will start immediately. Instead of cutting income tax, we will make additional resources of at least £1 billion available for investment in the NHS over the next 22 months. Each year thereafter, we will continue to tackle underfunding. Unlike the Conservatives, we ill not impose any new health charges. Labour will recognise the additional claims on the NHS from the growing number of very elderly people and the development of medical technology and knowledge. We will retain the pay review bodies. We will not cheat health authorities by agreeing pay awards which are not fully funded and leaving managers to bridge the gap by cutting patient care. We will invest in the modernisation of our hospitals and tackle the backlog of repairs and maintenance. We will also launch a new programme to invest £60 million in the modernisation of Britain's cancer services, using the resources we will save by scrapping the Conservatives' tax handout on private medical insurance. Within our overall budget, we will tackle the shortage of intensive care beds with a special programme providing an additional £25 million to expand this life-saving service.  A HEALTHY BRITAIN  Labour will launch a National Health Initiative to promote physical and mental health from birth to old age. This initiative will be led by the Department of Health and Community Care and by a new Cabinet committee that will cut through departmental boundaries. We will set new targets to cut the inequalities in health between social classes and ethnic groups. Our Health Initiative will set targets for better health, backed by effective action. We will, for instance:  - strengthen screening by restoring the free eye test;  - cut cancer by banning tobacco advertising;  - encourage healthy diets by introducing clearer food labeling;  - promote health at work by creating a modern occupational health service within the NHS.  GPs have a vital role to play in health promotion. We will increase the time they have for each patient by reversing the financial pressures to take on too many patients. We will make sure every community has access to dentists, with the resources to provide full NHS cover we will and restore the free dental check. By improving family planning services, we will reduce unwanted pregnancies and help achieve our target of cutting the number of abortions by at least a quarter. We will ensure that access to abortion is equally available in every region.  A MODERN NHS  We will create a modern, efficient NHS with incentives to improve performance - but without the queue-jumping and waste created by a market in health care. We will provide more services through local health centres and other community settings. We will give GPs the power to insist on improvements in service to all the patients in a neighbourhood. We will give the outcome of treatment the same importance as the throughput of treatment. Our new Health Quality Commission will monitor the quality of care and raise standards. The continuing care of very elderly and chronically sick patients will be a higher priority. We will halt the reduction in NHS services for long-term care and community health services which support elderly and disabled patients at home To achieve this change of direction, we will negotiate Performance Agreements with each health authority and back them with an Incentive Fund to reward authorities which perform well. These agreements will set local targets which reflect local priorities, for instance, to cut waiting lists or switch mental health services into the community. Hospital to managers, who will be accountable for meeting their targets, will otherwise be given maximum freedom of decision making. We will create new community health authorities, representative of local people, which bring together both GP services and hospital care.  A FIRST-CLASS SERVICE TO PATIENTS  In Labour's health service, power will belong to patients, not accountants. We will restore the right of patients to be treated in the hospital of their choice. Women will have the right to be seen by a woman GP and we will encourage the development of well women clinics. Ethnic minorities will have the right to obtain the diet required by their religious beliefs. We will set four new standards for a better service to:  - cut cancelled operations;  - improve cleanliness in hospitals;  - make it easier to phone for an ambulance;  - increase early admissions from waiting lists.  As part of our commitment to a quality service to patients, we will end compulsory competitive tendering for hospital support services, which has driven down standards of cleanliness and catering. We will invest £25 million from within our overall budget to purchase several hundred more new, fully-equipped ambulances.  A COMMUNITY SERVICE  Labour will expand the services which elderly people and their carers need for long-term support in the community, such as home helps, care assistants and community services. Our Department of Health and Community Care, with a new Minister of State for Community Care, will develop a high-quality programme of community care which responds to what users want. We will introduce a new earmarked grant for community care which will support the work of Labour councils in providing care for people at home, and oblige Conservative councils to use the grant to improve those services. We will end the pressure on councils to privatise their residential homes by providing funding for local authorities equivalent to the benefits paid to private homes. We will insist that the first call on income from the sale of mental health hospitals is the provision of better accommodation and services in the community for mental health users and people with learning disabilities. We will end the neglect that has allowed some former patients to end up sleeping rough and led to others being placed on remand. Labour will ensure that these services are in place before patients who will benefit from life in the community are transferred out of long-term hospital care.  Raising standards in our schools  Good education is the best investment in Britain's future. All girls and boys, from every background, must be able to discover their talents and fulfil their potential.  We want every child to get qualifications that count. We need safe, disciplined schools, where professional teachers work closely with parents. Learning must become a lifetime opportunity, with new chances to update skills at work. That is our vision of a well-educated Britain. But, under the Conservatives, Britain today invests a smaller share of our national wealth in education than in 1979. More and more parents are now being forced to pay for essentials in a system which should be free. Labour will modernise Britain's schools. Over the next 22 months, additional resources of at least £600 million will be made available for investment in education. We will then continue steadily to increase the share of Britain's national wealth invested in education.  WE WILL OFFER NURSERY EDUCATION TO THREE AND FOUR YEAR OLDS  By the end of the decade, all three and four year o1ds will have the opportunity of nursery education if their parents so wish. Within six months, every local education authority will have to set targets for steadily increasing nursery and childcare services. Childhood Partnerships between councils, parents, schools, local businesses and community groups will help extend a wide range of childcare and nursery education services. The immediate investment in childcare described earlier (see page 10) is only the beginning. Our Ministry for Women will have central role in helping to develop a nationwide childcare strategy, including out-of-school and holiday provision as well as care for younger children.  WE WILL RAISE STANDARDS IN OUR SCHOOLS  By investing in better teaching, smaller classes and modern books and equipment we will raise education standards. Teachers will be guaranteed a proper salary and career structure. A General Teaching Council for England and Wales will help them achieve the highest professional standards. Higher quality training will be followed by proper support for newly-qualified teachers. A national in-service training programme will ensure that all teachers are fully qualified in the subject they are teaching. Within 12 months, we will end the scandal of primary school classes of over 40 children. We will then establish and steadily reduce maximum limits on class sizes, until no primary school child is taught in a class of more than 30. To make sure that children are reading by the age of seven, we will create a national Reading Standards Programme, with a national Reading Recovery Programme to help those in difficult. £20 million will be invested in reading recovery in the first year. National tests must provide the information needed to help pupils, and to judge schools' effectiveness, without wasting good teaching time. Children with special needs or special abilities will receive the extra attention they deserve. Nine out of ten secondary school children are in comprehensive schools. We will end selection at 11 where it still exists. We will introduce a fairer system for all school reorganisations, with independent public enquiries. We will phase out the Assisted Places scheme (without affecting pupils currently on a place, or offered one from September 1992) and redirect the savings to meet wider educational needs. Because the national curriculum cannot be properly taught without new textbooks, we will earmark funds for class and library books. Every child needs a good grounding in science and technology. We will introduce a programme to improve equipment and laboratories. We will start to tackle the backlog of school repairs. For instance, we will invest £30 million to ensure that within 12 months, no child has to use an outside lavatory.  GUARANTEED STANDARDS  Conservative plans to privatise the schools' inspectorate will be scrapped Our Education Standards Commission, together with her Majesty's Inspectors, will monitor the performance of every school. If a school is under-performing, the commission, which will be answerable to Parliament, will have the powers to ensure that it is brought up to standard. National Awards, similar to the Queen's Award for Industry, will encourage excellence in schools. We will reform the Conservatives' scheme for the local management of schools. All schools will be free to manage their day-to-day budgets, with local education authorities given a new strategic role. Opted-out schools will be freed from central government control and brought together with City Technology Colleges into the mainstream of the local school system.  NEW RIGHTS FOR PARENTS  We will reform the Conservatives' scheme for the local management of schools All schools will be free to manage their day-to-day budgets, with local education authorities given a new strategic role. Opted-out schools will be freed from central government control and brought together with City Technology Colleges into the mainstream of the local school system.  Home-school contracts will tell parents exactly what the school undertakes to deliver and what their responsibilities are. If they are dissatisfied with the school or education authority, they will be able to call in the Education Standards Commission and get action taken.  We wish to see the key role of church and other voluntary-aided schools secured and available equally and on the same criteria to all religions.  WE WILL MODERNISE THE CURRICULUM  Labour will modernise the national curriculum and apply it in all schools. From the age of 14, pupils will study five essential subjects. English, mathematics, science, a modern language and technology. In schools teaching in Welsh, the study of Welsh will be included. Every pupil will also be offered a wide range of academic, technical and other options.  Taking account of the views of parents, enployers, teachers, pupils and the commendations of the Higginson Report, we will establish a five-subject A level and bring it together with technical qualifications into our new Advanced Certificate. Open to art-time and full-time students of any age, it will include 'credits' which can be transferred between different institutions. We will consult widely about the detailed structure of this new qualification, and finalise proposals quickly. Young people must have real opportunities to widen their experience and skills. Sixteen year olds not in full-time education will be entitled to a new traineeship lasting for up to two years, with an option of a further two years. Every young person in employment will be guaranteed the right to Learn While You Earn.  LABOUR'S EDUCATION TARGETS  We have set ourselves four education targets. They are the basis for our strategy and the benchmark against which progress will be judged. First, a nursery education for all three and four year olds whose parents wish by the year 2000. Second, within five years, we want four out of five 16 to 18 year olds to be able to achieve at least five GCSEs at grades A, B or C, or their equivalent. Third, by the end of the decade, we want half of Britain's 16 to 19 year olds to be able to qualify at the new Advanced Certificate levels or the equivalent in BTEC and other post-16 opportunities for study. Fourth, within 20 years, we will double the number of students in higher education, with at least one in three young adults participating by the year 2000. The student loan scheme deters many bright youngsters from poor families. We will replace it with a fairer system of student grants and targeted help for housing and vacation hardship. We will take effective steps to safeguard standards throughout higher education. We will stop the Conservatives' adult education cuts and encourage local authorities to develop adult and community education and access courses, particularly for mature students. People over 50 who missed earlier opportunities will be able to apply for a 'Return to Learn' grant towards further or higher education.  The best future for families and communities  Britain's families deserve the support which families receive in other European countries. We will create a new sense of community and social cohesion.  WE WILL MAKE FAMILIES BETTER OFF  As we explained earlier (see page 12), we will increase child benefit for seven million families. Higher pensions and related benefits will benefit another 12 million people. We will reform the tax and national insurance system, and take 740,000 low-paid people out of tax. After the first year's extra increases we will restore the link between increases in the basic pension and prices or earnings, whichever is higher. Britain's national insurance system is far more efficient than private insurance. We will open it up to new groups such as low-paid and part-time workers. Labour will end the Conservatives' freeze on benefits for widowed mothers and other lone parents. We will encourage parents on income support to claim maintenance by allowing them to keep part of it before benefit is cut. We will restore nutritional guidelines for school meals and reverse the cuts in free school meals as soon as possible. We will reform benefits for people with disabilities and make it easier for those available for work to take employment. As resources allow, we will improve and extend invalid care allowance. Labour will develop a flexible decade of retirement between the ages of 60 and 70, 50 that men and women can choose to retire on a full pension or continue in work without discrimination. Our new National Pensions Plan, building on the State Earnings Related Pension Scheme, will offer people now in work a pension based on their 20 best years' earnings. Those who are self-employed will also be able to join. Occupational and personal pension schemes will have to guarantee a minimum pension before they can contract out, and guarantee equal treatment for men and women. We will reform means-tested benefits, replace the Social Fund, and restore benefit rights to 16 and 17 year olds as soon as possible. To relieve anxiety about funeral costs, we will introduce a funeral payment of £600, available on request. The costs will in most cases be recovered from the deceased's estate, although small estates will be disregarded.  WE WILL ABOLISH THE POLL TAX  Labour will abolish the poll tax immediately. We will replace it with our Fair Rates system, related to people's ability to pay. We reject the Conservatives' unfair banding and discount system, which would create a property poll tax. We will modernise the valuation system to ensure that properties are fairly assessed. Abolition of the minimum 20 per cent contribution - which will be of particular help to young people - will be followed by an improved rebate system, with special help to retired people on low incomes living alone. Business rates will become a local tax again, with rate rebates for small firms.  PEOPLE NEED DECENT HOMES  Labour will establish mortgage rescue schemes throughout the country, enabling home buyers to remain as tenants or part-owners. Mortgage interest tax relief will continue at the present rate. We will seek new arrangements to enable first-time buyers to concentrate relief in the early years. Housing log books and an end to gazumping will also help home buyers. We will also ensure that home-buyers receive proper advice about the potential cost of their mortgages in future years.  Councils and housing associations will be allowed to lease or buy empty homes in order to provide accommodation for homeless people. Homes left empty without good r reason by any public authority will be e transferred to a better social landlord.  We will restore housing benefit to people under 18 and provide more refuges for women escaping domestic violence.  Labour will keep the right to buy. We will increase the number of homes for rent by establishing a Housing Bank to facilitate the balanced use of councils' capital receipts and offer investment capital at attractive rates of interest. Tenants will be offered the option to 'part rent, part buy'. Steps will be taken to improve sub-standard housing.  Council tenants will be guaranteed real rights over their homes. Councils will set rents at a reasonable level, reflecting income levels in the different regions and localities. We will eliminate racial discrimination in housing allocation and improve safety on estates.  In the private sector there is a need both for homes at market rents and those where rents are regulated and housing benefit payable. We will consult fully before introducing reforms and will not legislate retrospectively.  All tenants must be protected against noise, nuisance; harassment and shoddy service.  Leaseholders will have new rights, either to extend their lease, or collectively buy the freehold of their property from non-resident freeholders.  WE WILL PROTECT PEOPLE AGAINST CRIME  Crime in Britain has more than doubled since 1979. Over five million crimes were recorded last year, but the real total is certainly higher. Labour will insist that local councils work with the police to improve crime prevention by  - modernising vulnerable estates;   - improving street lighting;   - demolishing derelict buildings;   - fencing off waste-land.   Planning applications will be examined against crime prevention criteria. The sale of replica guns will be banned.  Elected police authorities will use the extra resources available for the war against crime to ensure that more police officers are visible on the beat, backed up by the modern technology which is essential to crime prevention and detection.  We will implement the recommendations of he Woolf Report to improve prison conditions. Prison must offer training for employment, not for crime. We will promote ion-custodial sentences for non-violent rimes and take steps to eradicate the discrimination in sentencing policy which particularly affects women and ethnic minority offenders  PEOPLE HAVE A RIGHT TO FIRST-CLASS SERVICES  We will develop customer contracts for local services, along the lines pioneered by Labour authorities. Local communities will help design services to meet their needs, with voluntary groups playing a key role in delivering services. Our new Quality Commission, incorporating the work of the Audit Commission, will ensure councils provide high-quality, value-for-money services, with clear avenues for complaint and redress. We will not tolerate shoddy service, inefficiency or waste. Councils will have to carry out an annual survey of customer satisfaction, published just before local elections. The contracts of chief officers will be linked to quality targets, with senior managers quired to sample the service they provide. Compulsory competitive tendering will be abolished, but the Quality Commission will have the power, where services have broken own, to insist that they are put out to tender, with contractors required to meet conditions such as quality thresholds and fair employment. Local planning must reflect what people, not developers, want. The Conservatives' bonfire of planning controls has led to ill-thought out development, often against the wishes of local people. Labour will give people more say in drawing up plans for their area and create a new right of appeal for residents against developments which fly in the face of their local plan. Beneficial development will be speeded up, damaging development checked and the green belt safeguarded. We will reverse the present planning presumption in favour of opencast coal mining and give top priority to local people and their environment.  COUNCILS MUST BE ACCOUNTABLE TO LOCAL PEOPLE  We shall introduce annual elections in England and Wales, with one third of councillors elected each year. Councillors must get proper support, to ensure that they are drawn from all parts of the community and are not financially disadvantaged. Labour will sign the European Charter of Local Self Government and give local councils a general power of competence, in line with other European countries, so that councils can develop new and imaginative services. We will reform the system for allocating grants to local councils and introduce less centralised rules on capital spending, enabling councils to make prudent long-term investment.  WE WILL SUPPORT ARTS AND LEISURE  Building on the example of many Labour councils which have developed imaginative arts initiatives, we will make the arts a statutory responsibility for local authorities. Labour's Ministry for the Arts and Media will encourage Britain's arts and their associated industries, including broadcasting and the press, to develop new ideas and attract more people. Government will commission the best designers, artists and architects, for instance, to help communities transform run-down city centres. We will renew the BBC's Charter in a way a which guarantees continuation of high-quality public service broadcasting - available in all parts of the country and covering a wide spectrum of programmes. The licence fee remains the best way of financing the BBC and preserving its independence. A concessionary fee will be introduced for all pensioners. As people have more leisure, they also need better facilities for sport. We will encourage councils to invest in modern, well-staffed sports centres for the enjoyment of people of all ages and abilities, and give mandatory rate relief to voluntary sports clubs. New facilities and better backing for people with outstanding talent will help put Britain back on the international sporting map. We will review sports taxation, reform the Sports Councils and make football grounds safe for spectators. We will stop the wanton sale of school playing fields and ensure that sport takes its proper place within the curriculum.  WE WILL PROTECT CONSUMERS  Our Consumers' Charter will cover all goods and services. It will include:  - tougher health and safety standards;  - compensation for injury from dangerous products;  - comprehensive guarantees;  - a fast, simple remedy if things go wrong.  We will press for similar standards throughout the European Community and strengthen the work of consumer groups and advice centres so that aspirations and standards are met. Every utility will be required to provide a customer contract, with compensation if standards are not met. Gas and electncity disconnections will be banned completely where young children or elderly people are concerned. We will regulate telephone services which demean women and corrupt children. We will strengthen the regulation of the utilities, enforce standards through our Consumer Protection Commission, and ensure prices are cut or other action taken where profits are excessive so that the customer gets a fair deal. We will establish a Petroleum Products Regulator. Government and Parliament will have a stronger role to work on the consumer's behalf. We will help consumers have a voice locally and nationally.  WE WILL CREATE A CLEANER, SAFER ENVIRONMENT  The greatest challenge we face is the responsibility to ensure the survival of the planet. Economic progress goes hand in hand with environmental responsibility. Labour will embrace the goal of sustainable development, with environmental modernisation an integral part of our industrial strategy. Labour's Prime Minister will go to the Earth Summit in June, with a commitment to stabilising emissions of CO2 (the main source of global warming) at their 1990 levels by the end of the decade and a recognition that significant cuts will be needed in the early years of the new century. We will adopt the tightest possible timetable for eliminating CFCs and other chemicals which deplete the ozone layer. Our tough pollution standards, based on the health and safety of children, will be enforced by an independent Environmental Protection Executive. We will develop a national waste strategy promoting waste minimisation, re-use and recycling. Business will be encouraged to have environmental audits. The trade in toxic waste will be banned. We will establish a new legal right to a clean environment, ensure environmental freedom of information, implement European environmental standards such as Environmental Impact Assessment and promote a European Environmental Charter. Every government policy will be subjected to environmental appraisal, co-ordinated by a Cabinet Minister for Environmental Protection. An annual Green Book assessing the environmental impact of government economic policy will accompany the traditional financial Red Book.  IMPROVING INNER CITIES  We will reverse the unfair treatment which has meant that the inner cities have lost out in terms of local government finance, housing investment and support for employment. Labour will pull together the present unco-ordinated initiatives into a coherent urban programme which will strengthen local economies, generate jobs and improve the quality of people's lives. We will encourage local councils to create enterprise partnerships with employers, trade unions and the community, which will mobilise the commitment and the enthusiasm of local people. The composition and terms of reference of urban development corporations will be changed immediately and they will in due course be wound up in an orderly way. At the local level, we will tackle litter and graffiti and start to transform inner city environments by establishing neighbourhood action areas where local communities can develop their own plans for regenerating the area.  CLEAN WATER, HEALTHY FOOD  We will ensure that our drinking water, beaches and rivers meet the highest European standards and end the dumping of industrial waste at sea. The provision of water is so fundamental that it is a priority for return to public control. In the meantime, we will protect consumers against high prices and poor service and give greater priority to environmental problems. Labour's independent Food Standards Agency will ensure high food quality standards. Our Department of Food and Farming will offer British farmers and consumers a better deal. Subsidies for production will gradually be replaced with green premium payments to promote environmentally sound management of the countryside.  WE WILL INVEST IN DECENT PUBLIC TRANSPORT  We will transform transport policy by ensuring, for the first time, that all road railway, aviation, shipping and inland waterways projects are judged on the basis of their environmental, social and economic impact. Within six months we will review the roads programme and mobilise private capital for large-scale public transport investment. All major transport projects will be subject to Environment Impact Assessment and we will fullly observe the requirements of the European Directive on EIAs. Road building proposals for sensitive areas such as Oxleas Wood and Twyford Down must be subject to full environmental assessment. We reject Conservative plans to privatise British Rail. Instead, we will modernise, setting clear performance targets to improve the quality of service and shift more freight from road to rail. We will tackle the problem of congestion and environmental damage by enabling local authorities to provide better quality transport. We will end the deregulation of buses, introduce bus priority measures integrated with new rapid transit systems within a 'green light' programme designed to encourage people to transfer to public transport. Proper concessionary fare schemes will be developed in every area. Traffic management schemes to cut unnecessary car use and better facilities for cyclists and pedestrians will make town centres safer and more attractive. We will reform transport taxation in order to encourage smaller, cleaner cars and the use of catalytic converters. The subsidy to company cars will be phased out. In London and the south-east, congestion costs the economy over £10 billion a year. We will stop bus deregulation and privatisation of London Transport and promote efficient public transport. We will seek to reverse the unacceptable decline in Britain's merchant navy and encourage the greater use of British-owned and crewed vessels, adding to Britain's security and reducing the cost to our balance of payments. All transport services will be required to meet high standards of service and safety, with effective avenues for complaint and compensation where appropriate. We will establish a new independent transport safety inspectorate within the health and safety legislation to improve the safety environment which has led to the terrible tragedies of recent years. Increased security measures and better staffing will be particularly welcome to women, elderly and disabled people.  SAVING ENERGY  Labour will give top priority to energy saving rather than energy sales. We will set up an Energy Efficiency Agency and a Renewable Energy Agency. We will require the gas and electricity companies to invest in insulation and other energy-saving measures. We will not invest in new nuclear power stations, continue with those in the planning process or extend the lives of existing nuclear stations beyond their safe life span. Britain's dependence on nuclear power will therefore steadily diminish. We will use the most modern technology to deal with the problems of decommissioning and nuclear waste.  A BEFFER LIFE IN THE COUNTRY  We will expand affordable housing in rural areas, develop countryside colleges to meet wider training needs and invest in workshops and small business units. We will support rural schools and improve public transport. The work of the Rural Development Commission and the Development Board for Rural Wales will be boosted. The ecological richness of our countryside must be protected. We will give people a new right of access to open country, create new national parks and step up protection for special sites. We will consult widely on the best way forward for nature conservation and countryside bodies, including independent boards for all national parks. We will safeguard Britain's rivers and canals and improve leisure facilities. Anglers will benefit from and contribute to our plans for improved river quality.  WE WILL PROTECT ANIMALS  We will reduce cruelty to animals within Britain and Europe. We will ban the testing of beauty aids on animals, outlaw fur farming and ensure better treatment of farm animals and animals in transit. Our national dog registration scheme will provide the money for a warden service. As part of our programme to outlaw cruelty wild mammals, we will allow a free vote in the House of Commons on a proposal to ban the hunting of live quarry with hounds and, if it is passed, provide parliamentary time for the necessary legislation. There will be no new limitations on the country sports of angling or shooting.  A modern democracy  It is time to modernise Britain's democracy. Central to Labour's purpose in government is our commitment to radical constitutional reform.  Our Charter of Rights, backed up by a complementary and democratically enforced bill of rights, will establish in law the specific rights of every citizen. We will start in our first parliamentary session with a Freedom of Information Act which will open up government to the people. Exceptions will be tightly drawn.  WE WILL GIVE POWER TO THE NATIONS AND REGIONS  We will move immediately to establish an elected Scottish Parliament. It will have powers to legislate for and administer Scotland's domestic affairs and modernise Scotland's economy and the ability to represent Scotland within the United Kingdom and Europe. Labour's legislation will be firmly based on the proposals agreed in the Scottish Constitutional Convention. The Parliament will be elected on an Additional Member System. It will be responsible for local government, health, housing, education, transport, environmental and other policies within Scotland. In our first year, we will introduce a new Welsh Language Act. We will establish, in the lifetime of a full Parliament, an elected Welsh Assembly in Cardiff with powers and functions which reflect the existing administrative structure. Local government in Wales will be reformed to create between 25 and 30 'most purpose' authorities. A regional tier of government in the English regions will take over many powers now exercised nationally, such as regional economic planning and transport. These new administrations will later form the basis for elected regional governments. To simplify local government in England, we will establish 'most purpose' authorities generally based on district councils. In some areas, a county-wide authority or the amalgamation of districts may be more appropriate. We will consult widely before finalising proposals. London is now the only European capital without the advantage of its own elected authority. Labour will give Londoners the right to elect a new Greater London Authority responsible for making London a better place to live and work.  WE WILL SAFEGUARD PRESS FREEDOM  We will remove unjustified restrictions on broadcasting and establish an urgent enquiry by the Monopolies and Mergers Commission into the concentration of media ownership. If the press fail to deal with abuses of individual privacy, we will implement the Calcutt Report's recommendations for statutory protection. Individuals must be able to control personal information about themselves. We will strengthen Britain's Data Protection Act in line with European practice. The security services will be brought under the scrutiny of a Parliamentary Select Committee.  WE WILL SEE THAT JUSTICE IS DONE  There is widespread concern about the miscarriages of justice which have imprisoned innocent people. As part of our sweeping programme of law reform, we will establish an additional appeals tribunal, including lay members as well as lawyers, to examine the most contentious convictions. The Police and Criminal Evidence Act will be reformed. Convictions will no longer be possible on uncorroborated confession evidence. We will improve access to legal aid and, when resources allow, extend it to tribunal hearings. We will encourage the expansion of voluntary advice centres and invest in better support for victims. We will appoint from the House of Commons a Minister for Legal Administration, who will initially be part of the Lord Chancellor's Department. We will go on to create a Department of Legal Administration headed by a Minister in the Commons who will be responsible for all courts and tribunals in England and Wales. Future reform of the distinctive Scottish legal system will be the responsibility of the Scottish Parliament. We will work with the legal profession to open up new opportunities to women and to black and ethnic minority groups, and create an independent judicial appointments commission. A Sentencing Council will bring some consistency into what is now often a haphazard process. A Court Inspectorate will improve the efficiency of our often outdated judicial system.  WE WILL OFFER EVERYONE A THE FAIR CHANCE  Stronger sex and race discrimination laws will ensure that organisations awarded government contracts take positive steps to promote equal treatment. We will introduce a new law dealing with discrimination on grounds of sexuality, repeal the unjust Clause 28 and allow a free vote in the House of Commons on the age of consent. In order to safeguard the rights of people with disabilities, we will appoint a Minister for the Disabled and extend anti-discrimination laws to cover this group. We will establish a Children's Minister within the Home Office to co-ordinate policies for children across departments. One independent Children's Commissioner will promote the interests of all children. Protecting children will be high on the agenda, as will the full implementation of the Children Act and the UN Convention to promote childrens rights.  LABOUR'S MINISTRY FOR WOMEN  Following the successful example of France, Germany and many other countries, Labour will appoint a Cabinet Minister for Women. She will ensure that women's voices are heard at the highest level. She will monitor the work of all other departments and co-ordinate action for equal opportunities across government. The Ministry will also initiate legislation for women. In particular, we will introduce a new Sex Equality Act which will combine and strengthen the current equal pay and sex discrimination laws. The Ministry for Women will have special responsibility for co-ordinating childcare policy, improving women's safety and encouraging more women to participate in public life.  THE BLACK AND ETHNIC MINORITY COMMUNITIES  We are determined to ensure that women and men from ethnic minority groups are full and equal members of the community. As well as strengthening the race discrimination laws and extending the powers of the Commission for Racial Equality, we will press for similar laws throughout the European Community. We will not tolerate the present level of racial harassment and attacks, and will ensure that more effective protection is given to vulnerable groups. Contract compliance laws will be the first step towards guaranteeing the black and Asian British their fair share of jobs.  FAIR CITIZENSHIP LAW  We will introduce fair immigration and citizenship laws which restore the right to British citizenship for every child born in Britain. Our laws, which will not discriminate on grounds of sex or race, will respect the right to family life. A new Act will guarantee sanctuary to genuine refugees but prevent bogus applications for asylum. We are determined to see that equally fair laws apply throughout the European Community and will oppose any attempt to remove voting rights from Commonwealth citizens in European elections.  NORTHERN IRELAND  Labour will continue the present talks on Northern Ireland. In the long term, we want to see a united Ireland achieved by consensus and without violence. We support the commitment in the Anglo-Irish Agreement that 'any change in the status of Northern reland would only come about with the consent of a majority in Northern Ireland'. We will work within the agreement to achieve our policy of unity by consent, and strengthen measures against injustice, discrimination and deprivation. We will fight terrorism by every lawful means, repealing the counter-productive Prevention of Terrorism Act and replacing it with measure which is more effective and genuinely acceptable in a democratic society.  A MODERN PARLIAMENT  Westminster must become more effective in protecting citizens and holding government to account. We will therefore improve the procedures and facilities of the House of Commons, strengthen scrutiny of EC legislation, and end ministerial misuse of the Royal Prerogative. We will give shareholders the right to vote upon all political donations made by public companies, require donations to political parties to be declared in a public register, require the accounts of political parties to be published and, as recommended by the Houghton Report, introduce state aid for political parties. Further constitutional reforms will include those leading to the replacement of the House of Lords with a new elected Second Chamber which will have the power to delay, for the lifetime of a Parliament, change to designated legislation reducing individual or constitutional rights. We will continue to encourage a wide and well-informed public debate on the electoral system. The working party on electoral systems which we established in opposition under the distinguished chairmanship of Professor Raymond Plant will continue its work with an extended membership and enhanced authority and report to the next Labour government. This general election was called only after months of on-again, off-again dithering which damaged our economy and weakened our democracy. No government with a majority should be allowed to put the interests of party above country as the Conservatives have done. Although an early election will sometimes be necessary, we will introduce as a general rule a fixed parliamentary term.  Britain in a new world  We need a new government to grasp new opportunities. A Labour government ready to exploit Britain's unique, interlinking membership of the United Nations Security Council, NATO, the Commonwealth, the European Community and the G7.  IT'S A NEW CHANCE TO ENHANCE PEACE IN THE WORLD  Labour, which in opposition joined our NATO allies in rejecting the Conservative government's cold war nostalgia, will in government partner the United States in negotiating to reduce the world's stocks of nuclear weapons. We shall seek to involve the four former Soviet nuclear republics, together with France and China. Until elimination of those stocks is achieved, Labour will retain Britain's nuclear capability, with the number of warheads no greater than the present total. With the increase in major nuclear powers from five to eight, proliferation is a dangerous reality and may become an even greater threat to peace and stability. The Tory government contributed to proliferation when it permitted the supply of nuclear weapons material to Saddam Hussein. The Labour government will work in the United Nations for a strengthened nuclear non-proliferation treaty, backed by meaningful sanctions and by a comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty. We will in addition work for a global ban on chemical and biological weapons and stronger controls to prevent proliferation of ballistic missiles. Meanwhile, we will join Russia in ending nuclear tests. We will actively support the peace-making role of the UN - for example, in Cambodia and Somalia - and work for a permanent United Nations peace-keeping force.  IT'S A NEW CHANCE TO SOLVE LONG-RUNNING DISPUTES  The Labour government will work in the United Nations and the European Community to enhance peace prospects in the Middle East. Our aims are security for Israel and self-determination for the Palestinians. There must be strict control on arms sales to the region. Labour will work in the United Nations, the Commonwealth, the European Community and NATO to help bring about the peaceful reunification of Cyprus, on the federal basis advocated by the sovereign government of Cyprus. The Labour government will make itself available to our friends in India and Pakistan to assist in achieving a negotiated solution to the problem of Kashmir that is acceptable to all the people of Kashmir - Moslems, Hindus and Buddhists. We will, as a matter of urgency, discuss with Hong Kong's representatives what measures may best enhance democracy and confidence during Britain's five remaining years of responsibility for the colony.  IT'S A NEW CHANCE TO PROVIDE GENUINE SECURITY FOR BRITAIN  As the party which took Britain into NATO, Labour will base its defence policies on UK membership of the alliance. We will provide whatever resources are needed for effective defence for our country, providing the necessary level of forces with the appropriate equipment and weapons. Unlike the Tories, we recognise that disarmament negotiations and technological change can bring about problems for our defence industries. Nearly 100,000 lobs have already been lost during the past two years and 123,000 more are in danger. Selling more arms to poor countries is not an acceptable or effective way of maintaining Britain's defence industries. We will stop sales to countries which might use them for internal repression or international aggression. The Labour government will set up a Defence Diversification Agency to assist workers, communities and companies affected by change. The agency will ensure that resources made available by reductions in defence spending - reductions already planned by the Conservative government - are used in the first instance for rebuilding and investing in our manufacturing base. From the fruits of this investment can stem finance for health and the social services.  IT'S A NEW CHANCE FOR A NEW EUROPE  The Labour government will promote Britain out of the European second division into which our country has been relegated by the Tories. Our first chance will be the United Kingdom's six-months' presidency of the Community, starting on 1 July. We shall use that presidency to end the Tories' opt-out from the Social Chapter, so that the British people can benefit from European safeguards. We will also use our presidency to help ensure that poorer countries are not disadvantaged as a result of the Single Market. We shall play an active part in negotiations on Economic and Monetary Union. We shall fight for Britain's interests, working for Europe-wide policies to fight unemployment and to enhance regional and structural industrial policy. The elected finance ministers of the different countries must become the effective political counterpart to the central bank whose headquarters should be in Britain. As part of the evolving role of the regions of Europe, we will establish a Scottish representative office in Brussels and seek appropriate representation for the Scottish Parliament in European institutions. We shall seek fundamental changes in the wasteful Common Agricultural Policy. Savings can help finance other Community projects. We shall make the widening of the Community a priority, and shall advocate speedy admission for Austria, Sweden, Finland and Cyprus, whose membership applications have been or are about to be lodged. We shall seek to create conditions in which, at the appropriate time, the new democracies of Central and Eastern Europe can join the Community.  IT'S A NEW CHANCE FOR HUMAN RIGHTS  Labour will set up a Human Rights Division in the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, and require all Britain's diplomatic posts abroad to appoint an officer to monitor human rights. There will be an annual report to Parliament. Decisions on economic aid and arms sales will be linked to human rights records.  IT'S A NEW CHANCE TO WIN FRIENDS ABROAD  Labour will end Tory government meddling in the valuable work of the British Council. Within carefully controlled costings, Labour will consider new scope for the BBC World Service, praised by listeners such as Terry Waite and Mikhail Gorbachev, and for the BBC's World Service Television Service.  IT'S A NEW CHANCE TO FIGHT WORLD HUNGER AND POVERTY  Under the Tories, Britain's aid budget has been cut to its lowest ever. The Labour government will aim to meet the United Nations aid target of 0.7 per cent of GNP within five years - the lifetime of a full Parliament. Labour will establish a separate Department of State for International development, whose Minister will be in the Cabinet. Tackling poverty will be the top priority of our aid programme. We will make aid more effective, work more closely with non-governmental agencies, put women at the heart of our programme and, in co-ordination with other donors, reduce the share of tied aid. Labour will promote environmentally sustainable development and encourage new approaches to reduce Third World debt. We will restore funding for development education in the UK. We will promote greater and fairer trade for poor countries, to enable their economies to grow and diversify. UN and European Community action to help the world's poor must become more effective. Labour will take Britain back into UNESCO. The Labour government will work within the G7 and the European Community to win support for a New Marshall Plan to assist the former communist countries of Central and Eastern Europe and of the ex-Soviet Union. Instability in those countries, caused by shortages and discontent, could be as great a threat to world peace as the armed communism that has now disappeared.  IT'S A NEW CHANCE FOR BRITAIN IN THE COMMONWEALTH  The Tories have regarded the Commonwealth as a wearisome obligation. Labour believes that this unique inter-racial and inter-hemispheric organization can play a central role in fighting racism, hunger and human rights violations. We shall play an active part in the Commonwealth and join the South Africa Committee of Foreign Ministers which the Tories have boycotted.  IT'S A NEW CHANCE TO SAFEGUARD THE ENVIRONMENT  The Tories have been laggardly and reluctant in international moves to protect our planet's environment. Labour will set the pace in pressing for international action to safeguard the ozone layer, to combat acid rain, to tackle the problem of global warming, to face up to the environmental needs of the poorest people of the world. We will scrap the Tory government's opt-out on European Community environmental protection measures and deadlines. Labour will adamantly oppose any attempts to permit commercial exploitation of the virgin continent of Antarctica. "
"Liberal Democrats",199204,"Changing Britain for good  Introduction.  This manifesto does not promise good times just around the corner.  It does not avoid difficult questions out of fear of unpopularity.  It simply tells the truth; the truth about what Liberal Democrats believe has to be done in order for Britain to succeed.  If you want Britain to stay the same then you probably won't like this manifesto.  But if you want real change, if you long for a better future for yourself, your family, your community and your country, then read on.  Britain has a clear choice at this election.  We can stay much as we are, in the same old muddle, with difficult decisions postponed.  Our failure to adjust to the modern world will then become ever more serious.  We will lag further behind in creating and sharing wealth. More and more people will lose their  jobs and homes. Our environment will go on deteriorating. Our public services, already second  rate, will become even worse. We shall fail to get the best out of the European Community,  because our leaders will continue to be afraid to tell us that shared success in the Community  means sharing sovereignty too. Our system of politics will continue to foster confrontation and  short-term thinking, and exclude ordinary citizens from the business of government. This  manifesto offers a different choice for Britain. Liberal Democrats do not believe that our  country's under-performance has to be accepted. Another forty years of failed government is  not inevitable. Britain has many advantages: a wealth of natural resources; a long history of  engagement with the rest of the world; a mature and inventive people who value tolerance and  freedom. But Britain will only succeed when its political leaders start treating voters as  informed citizens with shared concerns, not as ignorant consumers to be manipulated. Now is  the time for change. That is why in this manifesto we set out a clear analysis of Britain's  problems and our proposals for putting them right. Above all, Liberal Democrats will trust our  fellow citizens with the truth. So this manifesto is different from others you may read. We do  not shrink from the real choices for our country. We are not afraid to say what needs to be  said. We are not afraid to do what needs to be done. And we are clear that if we want to make  a modern Britain, we must first change Britain. Contents. What Liberal Democrats stand for.

We aim to create a society in which all men and  women can realise their full potential and shape their own successes. We believe that if we  could liberate this wealth of talent we would transform our economy and create a shared  society of which we should all be proud. Liberal Democrats know that this cannot be achieved  without fundamental reform. We must change our political system to give the citizen more  power and the government less; our economic system to confer power on consumers and to  provide employees with a share in the wealth they create; our public services to guarantee  choice and dignity to each of us; and our education system to equip us better for the modern  world. Liberal Democrats recognise the importance of the things we own in private but we  also know the value of what we hold in common. We believe that people are at their best as  members of communities, where they care about each other and for those less fortunate than  themselves. So our policies are designed to strengthen communities, tackle crime and poverty,  build up the common wealth and improve the shared quality of life. In the economic sphere we  know that the free market is the best guarantee of responsiveness to choice and change. But  we believe the market should be our servant not our master. So we see the role of government  as crucial in making the market work properly, by creating the conditions for success,  promoting competition, breaking up monopolies and spreading information. And government  has to be ready to make the investments which private enterprise will not, whether in  transport, education or public works. Liberal Democrats know that we have a duty, not only  to each other but to the generations which follow us, to protect the environment. We believe  that this is best achieved not by making people poorer or less free but by building true  environmental costs into the market so as to reward those who conserve and penalise those  who pollute. Liberal Democrats are uncompromisingly internationalist. We know that there is  a limit to what Britain can achieve alone and we are committed to building in the wider world  the sort of society we strive for at home, founded on mutual cooperation, political liberty and  shared prosperity. We have long been committed Europeans, believing that Britain can only be  secure, successful and environmentally safe if we play our full part in building a more united  and democratic Europe. Globally, Liberal Democrats will work to strengthen international  cooperation. We reject outdated notions of national sovereignty, believing they now stand in  the way of common action to deal with the scourges of disease and hunger, the deterioration  of the Earth's environment and the continuing dangers of the post-Cold War world. We  believe that all government, whether local, national, or increasingly European, should be  bound by the rights of the individual and should be fully accountable. Because Liberal  Democrats alone understand that we shall not change Britain's future unless and until we  change Britain's electoral system, we are committed to electoral and constitutional reform. We  shall not rest until the government of Britain fully belongs to the citizens it is there to serve.  Britain's balance sheet. In drawing up this manifesto, we have begun from where Britain is  today. Like any good auditor, we have been realistic about national achievements and failures,  about opportunities and problems. The result is a balance sheet which shows our country's  strengths and weaknesses. Despite some points of promise and potential, Britain's balance  sheet shows how much still needs to be done. The following pages reveal the extent to which,  in the economy, in the environment, in education, and in local services, successive British  governments have failed to realise the opportunities of the past decades. Although there are  bright spots, the general picture is one of relative decline in relation to other advanced  democracies. Forty years of failure are the result not only of misjudged policies from both  Conservative and Labour Governments. Even more crucially, they are the product of an  outdated political system which has consistently sacrificed the long term to the short term and  abandoned principles for expediency. The Economic Balance Sheet. UK exports. UK exports  in 1991: 103,804m. But imports have grown even more, to 113,770 million. The balance of  trade has been negative since 1982, and in 1979 hit a record 24 billion. Industrial relations.  Although industrial relations, as measured by strikes, have improved, there has still been  relatively little progress towards involving employees in the success of their enterprises -  through profit-sharing, share ownership and structures of participation. Positives. 1 In some  ways, British industry is thriving. In 1991, UK exports climbed to a record level of 103,804  million. 2 Industrial relations have improved markedly since the 1970s. Trade unions have  become more responsible and democratic. Days lost though strikes fell from more than 29  million in 1979 to under a million in the year to October 1991. 3 The excessively high  income-tax rates inherited from the last Labour Government have been brought down - from a  top rate of 83% in 1979 to 40% in 1992. Negatives. 1 Unemployment has been the most  obvious cost of the current recession. The latest figures show 2,604,100 out of work. The  number unemployed for more than six months has doubled in the last year. 2 The recession is  biting deeply into industry. Business bankruptcies have jumped from 28,935 in 1990 to 47,777  in 1991. 3 High interest rates are throttling the chances of economic recovery. British  three-month rates stood at 10_7% in February, compared with 9_5% in Germany 5_3% in  Japan and 4_3% in the US. 4 Britain is failing to invest for the long term. Investment in  manufacturing industry fell from 3_1 billion in the first quarter of 1990 to 2_5 billion in the  last quarter of 1991. 5 This failure to invest for the long term can be seen also in innovation,  the development of new ideas and products. In 1984-88 only 3_4% of patents granted in the  US to other nationals went to Britons (3_7% in 1979-83). By comparison, France had grown  from 3_9% to 3_4%, and Japan managed 18_8% (against 12_9% in the earlier period). 6  Britain's record of economic growth is very poor. the UK economy contracted by 2_2% in  1991 - the biggest annual fall since the 1930s - while Italy's grew by 1_3% and Germany's by  1_9%. 7 Conservative management of the economy has stoked the biggest credit boom in  Britain's history. Average personal debt as a proportion of disposable household income  mushroomed from 57% in 1980 to 114% in 1990. 8 Conservative taxation policies may have  reduced high marginal income-tax rates, but it was the rich who benefited, not the country as a  whole. From the beginning to the end of the 1980s, take-home pay rose by 41_4% for those  on 11/2% times the national average, by 37% for those on the national average and by only  32% for those on half the average. [Short-term management of the economy has meant that  governments manipulate interest rates to ensure re-election, rather than with the long term  interests of the economy in mind. Interest rates fell before each of the last two general  elections, only to rise again afterwards.] [This decline is not just a feature of the current  recession. From 1979 to 1983 the annual level of manufacturing investment fell by 33%. It  recovered to its 1979 level only in 1988.] The Environmental Balance Sheet. Renewable  energy generation. 45% of electricity demand could be met from wind power. UN fact: the  amount of electricity produced by renewable energy sources in the UK has steadily declined  over the last five years. While France produces almost 20% of its energy from renewable  sources the UK manages only 1_3%. Unleaded petrol. As in so many environmental matters,  Britain was late in introducing tax differentials for unleaded fuel. In 1989, sales of unleaded  fuel in Germany were more than double those in the UK. Positives. 1 Britain has a massive  advantage in natural resources that give it the potential to be at the forefront of renewable  energy generation. Government estimates show that up to 45% of electricity demand could be  met from wind power. 2 Government action can significantly affect standards of environmental  protection. The market share of unleaded petrol rose from 1_1% to 43_0% between August  1988 and November 1991, due to widening tax differentials. 3 Britain has a positive record on  protecting its countryside. More of our land is protected in National Parks than any other EC  member, and one more has recently been announced, in the New Forest. Negatives. 1 In too  many ways Britain unfortunately deserves its nickname of The Dirty Man of Europe. Carbon  dioxide emissions - the main source of global warming - increased in the UK from 525 million  tonnes in 1986 to 530 million in 1989. 2 The UK produces more sulphur dioxide, the main  cause of acid rain, than any other EC member, but is only now beginning to install  pollution-control devices to power stations. Germany started in 1984. 3 Prosecutions for  water pollution more than doubled between 1981 and 1988, while an additional 40 beaches  were found not to be complying with EC standards in 1990 - making a total of 20% of all  British beaches. 4 The Government has failed to invest in the development of renewable  energy sources - despite the fact that they avoid the pollution problems associated with coal,  oil and gas. Currently, just over 20 million is spent annually on renewable energy research  and development, compared to more than 200 million a year on nuclear power. 5 Even  worse, the Government has cut the budget of the Energy Efficiency Office, while investment in  energy conservation would save money and reduce pollution. The 1990-91 level of funding, a  meagre 23 million, is lower than it was four years before. 6 Pollution from road transport has  risen from 884 million tonnes of nitrogen oxides in 1980 to 1,298 million tonnes in 1989. 7 At  the same time, the proportion of freight carried on the railways between 1980 and 1990  dropped from 9% to 7%, while the proportion using road transport rose to 83%. 8 Rail  transport is placed at a disadvantage in Britain. Levels of government support for the railways  fell throughout the 1980s, from 1262 million in 1980-81 to 462 million in 1990-91. The UN  estimates that a reduction in carbon dioxide emissions of 20% by 2005 will be necessary to  avoid potentially disastrous effects of global warming. Yet the Government has committed  Britain merely to stabilise emissions by 2005 - well behind the majority of EC countries.  Congestion on the roads costs an estimated 15 billion a year, yet the Government continues  to do nothing to curb the rate of growth of car use - estimated at 142% between 1990 and  2005. The Educational Balance Sheet. The retention rate, however, is very bad. More than  half the country's qualified teachers left the profession. In recent years, the pupil-teacher ratio  has turned up once again - from 16_9 in 1990 to 17_2 in 1991. Positives. 1 In some ways  educational standards are improving. The number of teachers in nursery and primary education  grew from 176,228 in 1986 to 193,516 in 1991. 2 Similarly, pupil-teacher ratios fell from  18_2 in 1980-81 to 16_9 in `1990- 91. 3 Some of the Government's changes have been for the  better. The idea of Local Management of Schools has, in some places, produced school  management of imagination and quality. Negatives. 1 Overall, government funding of  education is inadequate. The proportion of Britain's gross domestic product devoted to  education fell from 5_6% in 1981- 82 to 5_0% in 1990-91. 2 The number of secondary school  teachers fell from 224,618 in 1986 to 198,030 in 1991. 3 There has been a serious decline in  the number of people qualifies as teachers., down from 25,000 in 1980 to 18,500 in 1988. The  Government is planning further cuts in teacher-training facilities. 4 British children lose out in  critical areas of education. The proportion of children in pre-compulsory education in 1987-88  was a mere 3_6% compared to 13_5% in Germany, 17_0% in Belgium and 18_4% in France.  5 Compared to our competitors, not enough of our young people stay on in post-compulsory  education. The proportion of 16-18 year olds in full-time education or training was 35% in  Britain in 1988, compared with 47% in Germany, 66% in France and 79% in the USA. 6  Investment in scientific research and development has fallen from 0_35% to 0_28% (while in  Germany it stands at 0_40%), not only affecting our higher education system but creating a  knock-on effect throughout the British economy. Funding. 1981-1982 5_6% 1990-1991 5%  In the same year, France invested 5_7% of GDP, the US 6_7% and Ireland 7_1%. Fall in  teachers qualifying. 1980 25,000 1988 18,500. The Government has been quite happy to  invest when it suit its own ideological ends. Pupils in opted-out schools are funded at an  average of four time the level of LEA pupils. The Social Balance Sheet. Home ownership  1981 55_8% 1991 67_3%. Government help has been directed to home owners at the expense  of others. Investment in local authority housing has collapsed and no help is available to the  private rented sector. Police Expenditure on the police has risen by 55% since 1978-79.  Insufficient effort, though, has been devoted to making sure policemen are on the beat. A  more visible police presence in communities is essential to combat both crime and the fear of  crime. Positives. 1 Overall, British standards of health are improving. Life expectancy for men  rose from 70_8 years in 1981 to 73_2 years in 1991, and for women from 76_8 to 78_8 years.  2 Home ownership in Britain rose from 55_8% of households in 1981 to 67_3% in 1991. 3  The size of the police establishment has increased by 15% since 1978-79. Expenditure on the  police rose by 55% in real terms over the same period, and police pay showed a 29% real rise.  Negatives. 1 While the NHS hospital sector's real purchasing power grew by 15_6% between  1980-81 and 1990-91, expenditure requirements (due to demographic change and the rising  costs of medical technology) in fact increased by 21_3%. 2 The total number of people  waiting for NHS treatment in the UK rose to more than one million in March 1990. 25% of  inpatients wait for longer than a year for treatment. 3 The number of sight tests has fallen by  21% since the introduction of charges in 1988. 4 The Government has withdrawn funding for  new house building, and refused to allow councils to spend the receipts they have gained from  new home owners. As a result, the amount of local authority housing built has fallen from  more than 65,300 homes in 1979 to a mere 8,600 in 1990. 5 The number of people accepted  by local authorities as homeless rose from 70,000 in 1979 to almost 170,000 in 1990 - and this  does not include the single homeless. 6 With the massive expansion of mortgage lending and  the subsequent use of interest rates to bring down inflation, the number of mortgages over 12  months in arrears rose from 59,600 in June 1991 to 91,740 by the end of the year. The number  of properties repossessed rose by 74% over the 1990 figure to 75,540 in 1991. 7 Outcomes  have failed disastrously to match the input of additional resources to law and order. Recorded  rated of notifies crime have increased year on year by 5_5% on average, and by a massive 16%  in 1990-91. 8 At the same time, crime clear-up rates have declined by 32%. 9 Britain has  proportionally the largest prison population of any Community country - and we also have  more prisoners serving life sentences than the rest of the EC combined. The cumulative  shortfall in the hospital and community health services sector in England alone now stands at  4_44 billion. Not only is imprisonment of doubtful value for many offenders, it is also  extremely expensive. Better value for money would result from less use of custody for many  classes of offender. Policies for the new century. It is clear from our analysis of Britain's  balance sheet that Britain needs change. Here are our first steps, the key measures which we  believe must be taken straight away if we are to break the cycle of Britain's decline, unlock the  full scope of Britain's potential and pave the way to future success. The First Steps. Britain's  political institutions need thorough-going reform: stable and representative government,  elected Parliaments in Scotland and Wales, decentralisation of power to the English regions  and to local government, freedom of information and a Bill of Rights. As the essential measure  to secure and entrench lasting reform we will introduce fair votes by proportional  representation for Parliamentary elections. In the middle of the recession, the economy needs  new impetus not a tax cut. We will immediately introduce an emergency programme of  investment in the infrastructure and in public works in order to get companies and people back  to work, thus reducing unemployment by 600,000 over the next two years. Lower inflation  and a stable climate for industry to plan and prosper will lead to long-term prosperity. We will  give the Bank of England independent responsibility for monetary policy, with a requirement  to promote price stability. We will put the pound into the narrow band of the Exchange Rate  Mechanism. Environmental priorities must be built into all economic decision-making,  ensuring that economic success goes hand in hand with environmental responsibility. We will  introduce new environmental incentives. The skills and capabilities of the British people must  be adequate to meet the challenges of the new century. We will increase investment in  education by 2 billion, funding this by an increase of 1p on income tax. Older people deserve  greater security. We will protect private pensions, and increase the basic state pension, making  it payable as of right without means testing. Britain's future must be safeguarded by active  membership of a European Community which is united and democratic and in which decisions  are taken as close to the people as possible. We will take decisive steps towards the economic,  monetary and political union of a democratic Europe. Only when these key steps have been  taken will government and individuals alike be able to plan for the long term, instead of  focusing on the short term and the next election. The balance of this manifesto sets out the  Liberal Democrat vision of the future: our long-term programme for government. The detailed  costing and revenue-raising effects of our proposals are contained in a separate supplement. 1  Britain's prosperity: public investment; private enterprise. Liberal Democrats aim to encourage  a competitive and enterprising economy which is environmentally sustainable, founded on  partnership and advanced skills and closely integrated with Europe. What the economy needs  is a new impetus. The Government's proposed tax cut will not achieve this. Only new  investment will provide the kick-start needed to escape from recession and reduce the waste of  talent and energy which results from unemployment. But Liberal Democrats also recognise  Britain's long-term needs. We are committed to the free market, to free trade and to the  creation of a competitive and enterprising economy. We do not believe it is government's job  to run business - people do that much better. We see government's role as enabling firms and  entrepreneurs to have the best possible chance. That means encouraging competition,  investing in skills, involving employees in the success of their companies, nurturing small  businesses, playing a positive part in the construction of the new European economy and,  above all, bringing greater stability to national economic management. Our long-term aim is to  shift the burden of taxation away from the things the country needs more of - income, savings  and value added - and on to the things we want less of, such as pollution and resource  depletion. Turning Britain round. The current recession is undermining Britain's  competitiveness and future success. Unemployment and business closures lead to a wastage of  talent and a loss of resources. At the same time, essential investment in our country's future, in  infrastructure, in education and training and in innovation, is being neglected. Liberal  Democrats will introduce an emergency programme of investment to end the slump. We will  immediately put in hand a major programme of public capital investment, funded by reversing  the Tory tax cut together with a prudent increase in borrowing. This, combined with a freeze  in business rates and new investment in education to increase the nation's skills, will kick-start  recovery and create jobs. We will: Attack unemployment by creating new employment  opportunities. Our emergency programme should reduce unemployment by at least 600,000  over two years. We will increase spending on public transport, housing, hospitals and schools,  on energy efficiency and conservation projects and on education and training - all sensible  investments for the country's future. We will aim to guarantee everyone out of work for six  months or more a place on either a high quality training programme or on a work programme  with a strong element of training. Invest in infrastructure. We will provide support for  transport infrastructure, including a dedicated high-speed rail link from the Channel Tunnel to  connect with the major routes to the North and West of Britain, and the extension of  electrification throughout the country. We will encourage the expansion of airports outside the  South East. Freeze business rates this year, thus effectively reducing them in real terms, a  larger reduction than that promised by the Government. Create a training incentive for firms  through the introduction of a levy equal to 2% of payroll, from which they would deduct their  expenditure on training. We will require employers to release their employees aged under 19  for a minimum of two days a week further education and/or training for nationally recognised  qualifications. We will establish a fully integrated system of skills training, leading to  recognised qualifications for a broad range of skills. We will increase 'access' courses for  mature students and retraining for women returners and those in mid-career. We will fund  crash courses in the main areas of skill shortage, aimed in particular at the long-term  unemployed. Invest in local economies. We will set up and fund new regional development  and local enterprise agencies. We will encourage TECs to become strong, locally based,  employer-led organisations providing business services, acting as an effective voice for  business at local level, and overseeing training of those in employment. We will encourage  decentralisation of banks and other financial institutions. We will end the present  Government/s policy of clawing back from local authorities amounts equivalent to those they  receive from the European Community's regional development fund. Invest in research,  innovation and design. We will increase immediately the government science budget to 0_35%  of GDP and raise it steadily thereafter. We will establish regional technology transfer centres  to bring together the resources of industry, colleges, and government labs. We will encourage  industry to invest in innovation and to improve the provision of seedcorn capital. We will  reverse cuts in design consultancy schemes and provide additional funding for the Design  Council. Making Britain competitive. A climate of enterprise and competition is vital if British  industry and products are to compete effectively in overseas markets. Yet the current  Government has concentrated instead on converting public into private monopolies. We will:  Stimulate competition. We will take tough action against monopolies, mergers and financial  raids. The Monopolies and Mergers Commission will be combined with the Office of Fair  Trading and made independent of government, increasing its effectiveness. We will introduce a  Restrictive Practices Act to penalise anti-competitive behaviour and end price-fixing by  cartels. We will encourage greater competition in the banking sector. Break up monopolies.  We will break up the monopoly providers of services such as British Telecom and British Gas.  We will permit access by private operators to the British Rail track network. We will liberalise  the coal industry by transferring ownership of coal reserves to the Crown (in line with other  minerals), and issuing licences to operate pits to other groups, as well as British Coal. Promote  consumer rights. We will take the lead within the EC to ensure that all products come with  accurate, full and simple product and service information. We will give consumer watchdogs,  including the regulators and trading standards departments, greater powers, and improve  redress for inadequate goods and services. Encourage decentralised wage bargaining. Our  plans to spread employee ownership and participation will encourage wages to be set  according to the profitability of individual firms rather than to some national 'going rate'. In  addition, we will encourage moves towards greater decentralisation of wage bargaining at  company level and, in the longer term as national and regional government develops, in the  public sector. Promoting enterprise. Government needs to provide an immediate impetus to  get the economy moving. But long-term private investment in the production of high-quality  tradable goods and services is essential for long-term success. This will only be possible if we  encourage a climate of investment, enterprise and partnership. We will: Reform taxation to  increase investment. We will increase investment substantially in schemes such as SMART to  encourage innovation in industry, particularly in small and medium-sized enterprises, especially  those involved in manufacturing. We will reform corporation tax and the taxation of savings to  achieve even treatment for different forms of savings. This will reduce the current tax penalties  on investment in industry. Encourage a long-term approach to private investment. We will  reverse the burden of proof for acquisitions away from the target company towards the  predator, and require companies to ballot their shareholders on bid plans. We will reform  company law to require greater disclosure of information such as expenditure on research and  development. We will define the responsibilities of non-executive directors and insist that all  publicly quoted companies have them on their boards. [Serving customers Many financial  institutions, and particularly some of the high-street banks, have a poor record of customer  service, for individuals and businesses. It is still far too common to see charges applied to  accounts, or interest rates changed, without customers being fully informed, and to see new  types of accounts opened without existing customers being told that they benefit from them.  Banks which are to their customers will be good for the economy. We will ensure that  commercial borrowers are entitled to a full contract specifying the terms, conditions and  duration of the services provided. We will introduce rights for customers of all financial  institutions, ensuring they are fully informed when changes are made which do or might affect  them.] Encourage small businesses and the self-employed, and ensure a 'level playing field' for  them in competing with their larger counterparts. This will include relieving the administrative  burden on small businesses, legislating to make interest payable on overdue debt, and  encouraging TECs, chambers of commerce and local enterprise agencies to reorganise to form  a network of business-led 'one-stop shops'. We will encourage, and if necessary legislate for,  banks to treat small businesses fairly by agreeing contracts for services. Encourage flexibility  in working patterns, including part-time and flexi-time work, job-sharing and home working,  adequate backup for carers of the young or old, and access to appropriate training. We will  encourage a new system of tax-free child-care vouchers for parents of children under five,  given by employers and usable in workplace, local authority and private nurseries and for  individual qualified carers. Share success in industry. We will legislate to establish the right of  every private sector employee in a substantial company to have access to a share in ownership  and/or in the profits they help to create. We will encourage profit-related pay, employee  share-ownership schemes and employee buy-outs. We will relaunch the Co-operative  Development Agency. Build partnership in industry. We will ensure that every employee has a  right to participate in decision-making in their enterprise. We will set up a new Industrial  Partnership Agency to help companies and their employees find the precise forms of  partnership which best suit them. Creating long term prosperity. We will change the ways in  which economic policy is made and implemented, to bring greater stability and a sensible  framework to economic management - ending the present 'boom, bust' approach. This requires  fuller integration with the European Community. Our key changes are: Establishing an  operationally independent Bank of England to become the Central Bank of the UK, to ensure  disciplined economic management, to end political manipulation of the economy and to form  the rock upon which a long-term anti-inflationary strategy can be built. This will also help  progress towards an independent European Central Bank. Moving sterling to the narrow band  of the European Exchange Rate Mechanism as soon as possible, helping stable progress  towards lower interest rates. Taxes and public spending to be set to reach a 'saving target' for  the nation over a period of years. We will set a target as a total of private- and public-sector  savings, and adjust fiscal policy to achieve the target over the medium term. If the country  does not save enough to achieve the target, we will alter taxes and public spending  accordingly, to ensure adequate long-term investment and keep the economy developing in a  non-inflationary way. We will encourage individual savings by giving tax relief on all income  paid into new Registered Savings Accounts. Reform of the annual Budget. We will publish a  draft Budget four months before the final version, to promote open discussion of economic  and taxation policy. This will facilitate the integration of spending and revenue-raising, a  measure we have long advocated. This will also make it easier to measure the impact of  economic policy on the environment. We will establish an independent National Statistical  Commission to collect and publish statistics and improve their quality. Working towards  European economic and monetary union, including the establishment of an independent  European Central Bank and a single European currency. We will renounce the Conservatives'  Maastricht 'opt-out' clause, accept the time tabled approach to EMU, and renegotiate the  Social Chapter with a positive British input. Changing the economy for good. Liberal  Democrats recognise that if we are to improve Britain's disappointing economic performance  we have to change the governmental system which produces it. Our proposals for electoral  and constitutional reform are a prerequisite for better economic performance. Proportional  representation will produce greater stability in government, ending the economic disruption  caused by sudden sharp swings in government policies before and after elections. Home rule  and decentralisation will ensure that economic power and prosperity is spread throughout  Britain. Integration within Europe will create the framework for long-term economic strength.  Freedom of information legislation and open government will improve competition and  encourage informed debate. A written constitution will ensure that politicians can no longer  ignore long-term priorities for short-term expediency and political advantage. [Child care  vouchers Britain seriously lags behind its continental neighbours in provision for child care for  working parents. This not only unfairly impedes opportunity for the people concerned, It holds  back the contribution to the economy of many highly skilled workers. We will encourage the  introduction of a system of child care vouchers, provided by employers to parents with  children under school age. They will be usable to pay for child care in a range of places -  workplace, local authority or private nurseries, play groups or by individual qualified carers.  The parent will choose, topping up the value if they wish. Child care vouchers will be  deductible expenses for the employers and tax free for the parents. Self-employed people will  be able to purchase vouchers and receive similar tax advantages. In due course the principle  could be extended to cover child care for older children.] 2 Britain's environment:  environmental protection and conservation. Liberal Democrats are determined to ensure that  Britain changes its ways so that it become a leader, not a laggard, in facing the environmental  challenge. Polluters will pay and conservers will be rewarded. Taxation will be gradually  shifted from the things we want more of income, savings and value added to the things we  want less of: pollution and resource depletion. The accelerating destruction of the environment  is one of the most serious challenges we face today. Its symptoms are becoming clearer with  every year, from global warming and holes in the ozone layer to poisoned rivers and polluted  air at home. They threaten not just our ability to enjoy our towns and countryside but our  health and our children's future. Liberal Democrats aim to cut pollution and clean up the local  environment. We aim to build a society that does not create wealth at the expense of the  environment. Our economy currently functions unsustainably, producing unacceptable levels  of pollution and rates of resource depletion. We will create new incentives to follow  environmentally sensitive strategies and behaviour. Protecting our heritage. Conserving and  enhancing the physical environment, countryside and townscape alike, is of crucial importance  to everyone's quality of life. Liberal Democrats will: Improve countryside protection policies  for National Parks, heritage coasts, areas of outstanding natural beauty, and sites of special  scientific interest. We will tighten controls against exploitation, we will create more National  Parks and we will improve access to the countryside. Introduce Countryside Management  Agreements for farmers and landowners who wish to take them up. These will be drawn up in  conjunction with local planning authorities with the aim of managing the countryside to  develop sustainable agriculture, safeguard plant and animal wildlife, and preserve traditional  landscape features, such as woods, hedgerows and dry-stone walls. Reform land use planning  so that the protection of the natural environment becomes a major feature of the planning  system. We will decentralise planning decisions as much as possible, giving a key role to the  local plan drawn up by the local authority. Clean up the cities. We will improve public  transport, reduce traffic congestion, and encourage pedestrianisation and cycling schemes. We  will encourage more parks, gardens and green spaces. We will provide more resources for  councils to deal with noise complaints and make compensation for excessive commercial noise  more widely available. Promote better waste management. We will provide grants for  recycling schemes, introduce regulations on the use of packaging materials, and encourage  local authorities to clean up litter. We will clean up beaches and coastlines by ensuring full  treatment of sewage. Improve standards of animal protection. We will set up an Animal  Protection Commission to enforce and recommend changes to legislation. We will phase out  battery cages and unacceptable systems of factory farming, tighten controls on the export of  live animals for slaughter, and establish a dog registration scheme. We will prohibit  experiments involving pain or distress for non- medical and non-veterinary purposes, promote  alternatives to the use of animals in research and education, and ensure that laws against  badger-baiting and dog-fighting are enforced. On hunting with hounds, Liberal Democrats as a  party have declared their opposition, but recognise, like the Conservative and Labour parties,  that legislation is a matter of conscience for each individual MP. Controlling Pollution. We  will use market mechanisms, where feasible, to reduce pollution by ensuring that  environmental costs and benefits are fed into the economy. Direct controls will still be needed  in some cases. We will: Set targets for cutting pollution. These include a 30% reduction in  carbon dioxide emissions from the UK by the year 2005; our energy policy is geared to this  target. We will ban the use of CFCs and halons by 1994. Introduce a system of tradable  emission licences. We will issue factories and power stations with licences setting a ceiling on  permitted emissions of pollutants such as sulphur dioxide. These will be tradable: those who  are most efficient at reducing pollution would have surplus licences which they could then sell  either to those less efficient, or back to government. The targets for emissions - and therefore  number of licences available - will be reduced year by year, leading to a steady fall in pollution.  Create a new Department of Natural Resources with sole responsibility for environmental  protection, leaving the Department of the Environment to cover local government and  housing. We will set up an independent and powerful Environmental Protection Agency to  work with the new European Environment Agency. Put forward plans for a powerful United  Nations Environment Programme to lead global efforts to protect the environment, operating  within the framework of an 'Earth Charter'. We wish to see a world market in tradable  emission licences for carbon dioxide and other pollutants. This would not only provide  incentives to cut pollution but also act as a channel for transferring resources to developing  countries. Conserving energy. Without an effective energy policy, government cannot have an  effective environment policy. Britain's national energy strategy must be set within an overall  European framework, with the aim of reducing pollution, improving energy efficiency and  boosting the use of renewables. We will: Support a Community-wide Energy Tax on all  energy sources. This will be related to levels of carbon dioxide emitted and will provide a  strong incentive for saving energy and investing in cleaner sources. Extra revenue raised  through the tax will be fed back into the economy by reducing other taxes such as VAT and by  protecting those least able to adapt to the higher price of energy. Invest in energy conservation  and efficiency. We will set new energy efficiency standards for homes, offices and factories,  and for products such as light bulbs, fridges and cookers. We will give grants for home  insulation and the installation of solar panels, and introduce energy audits of buildings. We will  encourage combined heat and power and district heating schemes. Double government  spending on renewable energy research. We will establish a Renewable Energy Office to  promote research, development and application, in particular of wave power, hot rocks  geothermal energy, passive solar design of buildings, small-scale hydropower schemes and  wind energy. We will complete the study on the construction of a Severn Barrage. Start to  phase out nuclear fission power stations, which are prohibitively expensive and potentially  hazardous. We aim to complete the phase-out at the latest by the year 2020 (and earlier if  feasible), and we will not proceed further with the construction of the Sizewell B PWR. We  will continue nuclear research, but at a lower cost. Reprocessing spent nuclear fuel rods  increases the volume of waste and should be undertaken only when necessary for safety  reasons. [We aim to build a society that does not create wealth at the expense of the  environment. We will create new incentives to follow environmentally sensitive strategies and  behaviour] [emissions] We will issue factories and power stations will licences setting a ceiling  on permitted emissions of pollutants. Air pollution index. Air pollution threatens the health of  millions of people - particularly children, elderly people and anyone with a respiratory  problem such asthma. Government monitoring stations measure levels of pollutants such as  nitrogen oxides or low level ozone but fail to publicise them widely. When levels exceed  World Health Organisation guidelines, the result is described as 'good' - in other countries it  would be called 'poor'. We will increase the number of monitoring stations, ensuring that all  major urban areas are covered. We will publish a regular air pollution index and encourage  newspapers and TV and radio weather forecasts to use it. This will increase public  consciousness of the pollution issue and prove of real benefit to the health of people. Making  transport clean and efficient. By expanding the provision and quality of public transport and  reducing society's dependence on the private car, we will improve travel efficiency and protect  the environment. We will achieve this by: Investment in public transport, increasing its  frequency of service, speed and safety, and reducing its cost to the individual - especially in  isolated rural areas where the need is greatest. We will encourage new schemes, using light  railways and trams in cities. We will require local authorities to define minimum standards of  accessibility in their areas and draw up transport plans which meet them. Immediate  improvements in the rail network, allowing more movement of goods and passengers by rail  and less environmental damage. We will construct a high-speed link from the Channel Tunnel  to connect with the major rail routes to the North and West, and extend electrification  throughout the country. We oppose the privatisation of British Rail, but will allow private  operators access to the rail network, while giving BR the freedom to raise investment capital  on the open market. A reduction in fuel consumption. All political parties accept that  long-term increases in petrol prices are not only environmentally necessary but unavoidable.  We will phase these in gradually by applying our Energy Tax to petrol, while at the same time  graduating Vehicle Excise Duty and Car Tax according to fuel efficiency - so that the most  efficient vehicles pay least. These price increases will not be brought in unless and until  compensation schemes for individuals and rural communities which have no alternative to the  use of cars are ready to be introduced. We will scrap the remaining tax breaks for company  cars and apply tougher limits to permitted emissions. Assisting people in rural areas by making  concessionary fares on local public transport. widely available. We will encourage the use of  village minibuses, 'post and passenger' buses and taxi services. People who have no  alternatives to private cars will be helped by our plans to graduate Vehicle Excise Duty and by  specific target measures to help isolated communities. Action against traffic congestion in  urban areas. We will encourage local authorities to introduce peak-hour bans on cars, traffic  calming measures, car-sharing schemes and further pedestrianisation. We will introduce a  variety of road-pricing schemes, in which motorists pay a premium to use highly congested  roads at busy times of the day. New priorities for road building. We will approve major  motorway or trunk road investments only where it can be demonstrated that alternative  transport provision cannot meet the need at lower economic and environmental cost. Essential  new roads and improvements will still proceed, but the creation of a 'level playing field' in  decision-making between rail and road will ensure some switch of passenger and freight  transport to the railways. The expansion of airports outside the South East, while at the same  time freezing further development at Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted. Reversing the decline  in the Merchant Fleet. For economic and defence reasons, we will boost British shipping and  promote recruitment and training for the Merchant Navy. Environmental planning policies. We  will introduce planning policies which will encourage the building of homes near workplaces,  leisure facilities, shops and other services. Where this is not possible, public transport routes  must be easily accessible. We will encourage the use of information technology to decentralise  work. [Water District Discount According to the Government, water bills will rise by 50%  within the next few years. For many households (in, for example, Wales), water bills are now  higher than bills for all local government services put together. Since 1989 nearly a million  summonses have been issued to people who could not pay their water bills. At present water  companies have a Bulk Supply Discount for commercial customers - a 'wholesale price' for  their water. Liberal Democrats will alter the licensing conditions for water companies to  extend this to groups of domestic consumers who live on large estates and in sheltered  housing complexes. This District Discount will keep down bills for elderly people and many  low income inner city residents living on large estates.] Building a sustainable economy.  Liberal Democrats aim to build an economy which is not only competitive and enterprising but  also environmentally sustainable, leaving future generations a wealth inheritance - of  knowledge, technology, capital and environmental assets - at least as great as that inherited by  the current generation. Our proposals are: A better method of measuring economic progress.  The conventional target of growth in GDP is a poor indicator of progress. We will modify  GDP by incorporating measurements of pollution and resource depletion to create a figure for  sustainable national income. We will also use indicators of social and personal quality of life  such as changes in life expectancy, literacy rates and educational attainments to give a better  measure of progress. The Prime Minister will present an annual report on changes in these  indicators to Parliament. A system of environmental incentives and penalties. We will make  available grants and subsidies for environmentally friendly activities, such as home insulation,  and to help individuals and industry adjust to our new stricter standards for pollution control.  We will penalise activities which harm the environment or deplete stocks of raw materials  through taxation, so that prices reflect the damage they do. Our new Energy Tax is this  manifesto's key proposal in this area. The revenue raised will be used to reduce other taxes  such as VAT. Enable consumers to identify and choose sustainable products. We will  introduce new product labels, showing information such as energy consumption during use  and the environmental impact of the production process. We will introduce strict standards of  life expectancy for consumer durables and encourage deposit-refund schemes. We will  improve recycling and waste-disposal systems. We will encourage environmental audits for  companies, showing the environmental impact of their activities. Reviving rural communities.  Our policy for the countryside aims both to protect Britain's natural environment and to  recreate success in one of Britain's greatest industries/ agriculture. The farming industry is  passing through a period of profound change; most farmers recognise that the industry must  achieve a better balance with the market and the environment. We will help this transition by:  Working for fundamental reform of the Common Agricultural Policy. We want to ease the  adjustment from the present price support mechanism towards market prices and direct  support aimed at assisting the farming industry in transition and at environmental and social  goals. These will be funded by savings made out of the present intervention mechanisms of the  CAP. New incentive payments for environmental objectives, in particular for extensifying food  production (using land less intensively), and reduced-input and organic farming. Countryside  Management Agreements, described above, will be a key feature in this shift of CAP resources  from price support to environmental goals. Reformed systems of direct support, aimed in  particular at helping family farms and crofts. Introducing renewable limited-term tenancies for  agricultural land, encouraging new entrants to farming. We will encourage local councils to  continue to provide smallholdings and to introduce part-time holdings for new entrants.  Expanding forestry. We support the long-term aim of doubling the area of the UK under  forestry, but this must include a higher proportion of broad-leafed hardwoods. We oppose the  privatisation of the Forestry Commission. We will create more community forests near large  towns. Encouraging fishing and fish farming. We will improve the Government's  decommissioning proposals and appraise, with the industry, effective technical conservation  measures. We should move towards fisheries licensing and management on a more regional  basis to help traditional fishing communities and protect those who fish sustainably, such as  mackerel handliners. We will transfer full planning responsibility for fish farming to local  authorities, and we will increase research into the environmental aspects of fish farming and  diversification. We will work with the EC to counter the dumping of stocks into the  Community. The extension of Rural Development Agencies. These will be responsible for  co-ordinating development and diversification, in partnership with local authorities, the private  and voluntary sectors and local communities. Tougher action on food safety. We will transfer  responsibility for food standards from the Ministry of Agriculture to a new Food and Drugs  Commission. We will bring in much tighter labelling requirements for all foods, and make  funding available for food research and scientific establishments. We will improve consumer  representation on government advisory committees. [Our policy for the countryside aims both  to protect Britain's natural environment and to recreate success in one of Britain's greatest  industries, agriculture.] 3 Britain's skills: excellence for all. Britain's citizens are our greatest  asset. Liberal Democrats will invest in people to enable every individual to fulfil their potential,  and, in so doing, build the nation's economic and social strength. We aim to create a first-class  education system for all, not just by providing adequate public funding, but also through  reforms which increase choice and opportunity for each citizen. Liberal Democrats start from  the belief that every individual, whatever their age, sex, background or ability, possesses a  unique potential and a valuable contribution to offer society. Our target is excellence for all.  This requires more relevant courses, higher standards and improved provision. Excellence also  has a cost. We will guarantee that Liberal Democrats will increase investment in education by  2 billion in the first year, even though this will require an extra penny in the pound on income  tax. Our priorities for investment are pre-school education, education and training for 16-19  year olds, and adult education Aiming high; raising standards. Our aim is simple - to give  Britain a world-class education system, in which high quality is the key, by the year 2000. We  will: Create the framework for high standards by establishing a single Department of  Education and Training with oversight of all education and training. We will set up a National  Qualifications Council to co-ordinate a single system of academic and vocational courses for  14-19 year olds, and a new Higher Education Standards Council to monitor quality in higher  education. Improve inspections. We will ensure that a fully independent HM Inspectorate of  Education and Training, properly staffed and funded, reports on the entire range of public and  private provision from pre-school education to universities. Local inspectors of schools will be  answerable to the Inspectorate, which will also have a new role as Education Ombudsman. We  will carry out a School Buildings Audit alongside the regular four-yearly local school  inspection, to assess the physical state of schools and equipment. We will reinstate the  buildings standards suspended in 1989. Support teachers. We will set up a statutory General  Teaching Council to improve professional qualifications and set standards for teacher training  and retraining. We will improve provision for in-service training and career breaks for women  teachers with children. We supported the introduction of the Teachers' Pay Review Body and  believe it will ensure that teachers are properly rewarded. Putting education at the heart of the  community. Liberal Democrats pioneered Local Management of Schools. Now we aim to  increase further the day-to-day independence of schools and colleges within a democratically  accountable framework of local education authorities. This includes: A new independence for  schools and further education colleges. We will give schools increased administrative support  in return for the wider opening of their facilities to the local community. We will fully fund  individual teacher costs. We will encourage every school to enhance its character, ethos and  areas of special interest within a more flexible National Curriculum framework. Within this  context of greater freedom for all schools, we will end the two-tier system created by Grant  Maintained Schools and City Technology Colleges by returning them to the strategic planning  framework of the local elected education authority. Strategic responsibility for adult and  further education will remain with the LEA. LEA representatives on school governing bodies  will reflect fairly the political balance of the authority. [Opening schools to the community  Schools should be seen as a valuable resource, not just for their pupils but to the communities  around them. Access to their believe libraries, computers, meetings rooms, sports halls,  playing fields and swimming pools could make a big contribution to community life. We will  encourage all schools to open up these facilities to local people in the evenings, at weekends  and in school holidays. Some of our proposed expansion of adult education will be organised  in this way. Local authorities, particularly community councils where they exist - will help to  provide the administrative support needed to manage such open access.] A new role for local  democracy. We will require LEAs to guarantee a suitable place, with proper support, for every  child in education and training up to the age of 19. This will include responsibility for ensuring  that schools and colleges meet the highest standards of academic performance, discipline and  behaviour, and for providing special services for schools, such as peripatetic music, language  development, or behaviour support. Published information about schools and colleges will  recognise achievement on the basis of 'education value added' progress made by pupils - rather  than crude 'league tables' of results. Independent schools. We recognise the contribution to  excellence which the best of these schools make, and the right of those who wish to pay for  private education to do so, but this should not be subsidised from public resources. We will  phase out the Assisted Places Scheme without affecting those already in it, and restore the  money saved to state schools. We will review the charitable status of independent schools with  the intention of ensuring that the benefits of charitable status are only awarded to those  institutions that make a genuine contribution to the wider community. Educating the  individual. Liberal Democrats will ensure that every individual can receive high-quality  education and training throughout their life from before school to retirement. But the current  system places too little emphasis on vocational achievements. We will: Guarantee pre-school  education for every child. We will guarantee every child access to two years' pre-school  education with a choice of pre-school provision. Introduce a National Record of Achievement.  We will ensure that every pupil has a National Record of Achievement so that progress is  properly documented and shared between parents and schools. Supplemented by individual  diagnostic testing, this will replace the current Standard Assessment Tasks in order to raise  standards. Reduce class sizes. We aim to reduce maximum class sizes so that no registration  class in the country need have more than 30 pupils. Reward academic and vocational  achievements. Our new National Qualifications Council will develop a modular, credit-based  course and examination structure for the 14- 19 age group, covering both vocational and  academic courses. This will build on a simpler, more flexible National Curriculum and a  revised and extended system of National Curriculum levels. Pupils from the age of 14 will  study a balanced curriculum around a core of maths, English, science and a foreign language,  adding specialisms in academic, vocational or technical courses, some delivered by employers  in the workplace. We will ensure that all 1419 year olds have a personal tutor and careers  advice, helping them build the foundations for personal fulfilment and success. Broaden  post-16 education. We will give all 16-19 year olds in work the equivalent of at least two days  a week education or training. Courses will be selected by both the employer and the individual  and will be accredited as part of our new 14-19 system. Those studying full time will study up  to three major and two subsidiary subjects, adding work experience, parenting and citizenship  to build a baccalaureate-style programme. Improve Special Educational Needs provision. We  will give every LEA a separate Special Educational Needs service with its own budget for  which schools will bid for funding. We will require schools to prepare, for every child with  special needs who is not currently covered, an indicative statement to identify needs, set  targets and report progress. The service will be monitored by specialists in the local inspection  team and in HMI. Enable education for life. We will give every citizen an entitlement to a  period of retraining or education at a time of their choice during their adult lives, based on  distance learning costs. We will start by giving this guarantee to those groups most in need,  including the long-term unemployed and single parents. [We will guarantee that Liberal  Democrats will increase investment in education by 2 billion in the first year. Our priorities  for investment are pre-school education, education and training for 1619 year olds and adult  education.] Opening the doors to higher education. Britain's higher education system still  provides excellent standards of education, but does so for too few people. Liberal Democrats  aim to increase both participation and flexibility in studying for degrees, because not all  students want to follow traditional three-year courses. We will: Increase the number of  students in higher education to two million by the year 2000. As well as more young people,  we will particularly encourage the participation of women, people from minority ethnic and  poorer backgrounds, and people with disabilities. Increase flexibility in courses. We will  introduce a credit based system, enabling students to achieve a diploma after the equivalent of  two years, with the option of a further one or two years' study leading to a degree. We will  make financial assistance available for part-time study. Open up new opportunities for study.  We will develop distance learning opportunities and extend the franchising of higher education  courses so that courses can start at local colleges - helping people who wish or need to study  from home. Fund students properly. We will abolish student loans and restore student  entitlement to housing benefit and income support. As our plans for the reform of tax and  benefits are implemented, we will establish a Student Income Entitlement and a Student  Allowance to which all students, both full- and part-time, will be eligible. Guarantee quality.  Our new Higher Education Standards Council will ensure that as numbers rise, quality does  not suffer. We will establish a proper career structure for research fellows and set up a Pay  Review Body for academic and non-academic staff to halt the brain drain. Invest in research.  We will immediately increase the science budget to 0_35% of GDP, and raise it steadily  thereafter. We will establish a new Humanities Research Council. 4 Britain's people: healthier,  safer, and better housed. Liberal Democrats will invest in local services to enable communities  to thrive. Our aim is to ensure that individuals of all backgrounds and means can live free of  the fear of sickness, poverty and crime. The steps we outline in this paper are necessary to  create a fair, democratic and prosperous society, in which individuals are able to make their  voice heard and develop their talents and skills to the full. But we believe that people can  realise their potential best not as isolated individuals, but as members of thriving and  responsible communities. We will invest in the network of community services health, housing,  crime prevention, social security, arts and sport - to improve quality, choice and opportunity  for everyone. Guaranteeing high-quality health care. Liberal Democrats remain steadfastly  committed to the original aims of the NHS: to enable everyone to live free of the fear of  illness, injury and disability; to provide health care free at the point of delivery and regardless  of ability to pay. The Government's 'reforms' mean that patients are made to follow the money;  under our proposals, money will follow the patients. We especially oppose the two-tier Health  Service which the Government is creating. Our priorities are: A decent level of health service  funding, including an annual real increase to match the costs of new technology and the  growing number of elderly people. We will start to replace the underfunding suffered by the  Health Service under the Conservatives, invest more in renovating and constructing new  health service buildings, and increase spending in the priority areas listed below. We will  abolish tax relief for private health insurance, whilst protecting the rights of existing  policy-holders. Health promotion - keeping people healthy, and treating the root causes of ill  health. We will provide resources for preventive medicine, health education and occupational  health, invest in screening programmes for the prevention of disease, tackle the problems of  drug abuse, ban tobacco promotion, remove charges for eye tests and dental check-ups, and  both freeze and extend exemptions from prescription charges. We will increase resources for  primary care. We will restore a comprehensive dental screening service in schools and improve  the dentists' NHS contract. We will require all government departments to take account of the  impact on health of their decisions - of crucial importance in areas such as industrial  investment, housing, social security and environmental protection. Real choice in health care.  We will introduce an effective Patient's Charter, including rights to hospital treatment within a  specified time, a choice of GP, guaranteed access to health records, and a comprehensive  no-fault compensation scheme. We will require health authorities to publish a Charter of  Services, defining basic entitlements, and provide redress where these are not satisfied. We  will establish a new National Inspectorate for Health to guarantee a quality service. Better  health care for women. We will ensure access to clinics providing health promotion,  counselling, family planning and screening services, particularly for cervical and breast cancer,  and advice on maternity and child care. We will increase the availability both of treatment by  women health professionals and of home birth. High-quality community care, available  through voluntary, private and local authority services to people unable to care for themselves.  We will give users control over the options for care and provide services in a way which  guarantees individuals maximum independence while retaining existing community links. We  will provide bridging finance for local authorities for the transition to the new legislative  arrangements on community care Investment in NHS staff, including in-service training,  especially in areas of significant shortage and changing roles. We will reform medical staffing  and training to replace the consultant-led hierarchy with teams of accredited specialists. A  health service for all. We will ensure that the assessment of health-care needs and the strategic  planning of all services are the responsibility of democratically accountable health authorities.  We will replace the so-called 'internal market' with service agreements between authorities and  hospitals and other health units. We will replace GP fundholding with a system which  guarantees GPs freedom to refer patients outside the service agreements negotiated by health  authorities. We will create a common structure of Local Management of Hospitals and  community units, ending the ability of NHS Trusts to dispose of their capital assets, to set  their own terms and conditions of service for staff, and to withdraw from local planning of  health services. Providing good housing. Decent, affordable and safe housing is vital to  personal happiness and family life. We will encourage home ownership, but we recognise that  the housing market has been distorted by mortgage tax relief, and we believe that choice in  housing means providing more rented accommodation in both public and private sectors. We  will: Introduce housing cost relief weighted towards those most in need and available to house  buyers and renters. This will replace mortgage tax relief for future home buyers, which often  helps most those who need it least, and causes enormous distortions in the savings and  housing markets. People holding mortgages will be protected: they will have the choice of  moving to housing cost relief or continuing to receive mortgage interest tax relief. Boost  house building and renovation. We will relax controls on local authority capital receipts,  especially for new council building, for houses built in cooperation with housing associations,  and for renovation and repair work. We recognise that the urgent need for homes can only be  met by mobilising both private investment and public spending. We will therefore create a new  Partnership Housing sector to ensure high-quality affordable rented housing. Improve tenants'  rights to better standards of repair and maintenance in the public and private sectors. We will  encourage councils to create more tenants' co-operatives. We will retain the right of council  tenants to opt for a change of landlord, but only after a fair ballot. Take urgent action on  homelessness. We will pay income support to claimants in advance and assist with initial  deposits, extend the duty of local authorities to provide accommodation for 16-18 year olds,  and encourage councils to assist each other with housing needs. We will fund the provision of  short-term rented housing to reduce the use of bed and breakfast accommodation. We will  legislate to bring into use dwellings left empty without reasonable cause for more than a year.  Adopt new environmental standards for all buildings, commercial and domestic. We will  introduce a requirement for energy audits on all new buildings as a precondition of grants for  home insulation, solar heating and other energy-- saving measures. Homes which meet the  new standards will be exempt from stamp duty on house purchase. We will encourage shared  combined heat and power schemes, and encourage those planning new houses to take into  account the scope for passive solar heating. Protecting the community. Over the past ten  years recorded crime has risen faster than at any time in our history. Meanwhile, prison  conditions have deteriorated and the public has lost confidence in the criminal justice system.  Liberal Democrats will reverse this trend by: Creating safe and secure communities. We will  give local authorities the powers to develop comprehensive community crime prevention  programmes, improve services to victims and encourage Neighbourhood Watch and Safer City  Programmes. We will pay special attention to the underlying social problems in high-crime  areas, particularly to prevent young people drifting into crime. [Home energy efficiency  discount Saving energy in the home makes good environmental sense, and will save money  on electricity and gas bills. We will make houses which meet high standards of energy  efficiency exempt from the first 1000 of stamp duty when they are sold. Their energy  standard will be assessed by an energy audit carried out by the local authority's energy  efficiency unit. If a home does not meet the minimum standard, the owner will be able to claim  back all money spent within the first year after purchase on raising it to that level, through,  for example, home insulation, up to the amount of stamp duty they paid when they bought  the property (up to the maximum of 1000). This will help to cut pollution and save energy  and give a valuable boost to the housing market.] Putting more police officers on the beat.  We will redeploy police resources in order to increase police presence in local communities  and establish local neighbourhood offices. We will decentralise budgetary control to police  subdivisions. We will encourage recruitment campaigns and training for promotion to increase  the number of women and ethnic minority officers in the police force and especially in the  higher ranks Multicultural and anti-racism training will also increase confidence in the police  among minority ethnic communities. We will support the creation by the police of new Racial  Attacks Squads to monitor and co-ordinate action against racially-motivated attacks.  Reforming the criminal justice system. We will establish a Ministry for Justice, merging the  relevant functions of the Home Office and the Lord Chancellor's Department. We will create  the post of Public Defender, equivalent in status to the DPP and responsible for investigating  alleged miscarriages of justice. We will extend legal aid, ensuring that justice is more widely  available. We will encourage 'restorative justice', in which mediation between victims and  offenders provides reparations for those who suffer from crime. Radically reforming  conditions inside prisons, reducing overcrowding, improving prison officers' morale and  punishing offenders where possible within the community. We will create women's units in  prisons where feasible. We will extend the rights and responsibilities of prisoners along the  lines recommended by the Woolf Report, and create the post of Prison Ombudsman. Amend  the provision of the Asylum Bill. We will introduce improved welfare and legal rights for  genuine asylum seekers and establish substantive rights of appeal. Ensuring a decent income  for all. The tax and social security systems are long overdue for reform. Our objectives are to  simplify and integrate the two systems, to mount a determined assault on poverty and  dependence, and to protect our citizens from want. We will work towards the eventual  creation of a new 'Citizen's Income', payable to all irrespective of sex or status. For pensioners,  the Citizen's Income will be well above the present pension, and for everyone else it will be  about 12_80 a week (at present prices). Unpaid work will at last be recognised as valuable.  Women caring in the home, for example, will receive an independent income from the state for  the first time. The Citizen's Income will be buttressed by a single benefit for those in need,  unifying income support and family credit, with supplements for people with disabilities and  for child-care support. These reforms will ensure that every citizen is guaranteed a decent  minimum income, whether or not they are in employment. Our immediate priorities, which will  act as steps towards the Citizen's Income, include: Immediate improvements in benefits. We  will increase Child Benefit by 1 per week for each child. Income support for under-25s will  be paid at the full rate, an increase of 8_50 per week. We will give back to 16 and 17 year  olds the right to claim income support. We will end immediately the minimum poll tax level of  20%, prior to the abolition of the tax itself. We will reform the Social Fund, removing its cash  limit and converting most loans into grants. Increasing the basic state pension immediately by  5 a week for single pensioners, and by 8 a week for married couples. This higher basic  pension will be paid to every pensioner, regardless of their contributory record, to end the  indignity of means testing. After the initial increase we will uprate the basic pension every year  in line with average earnings. This will be paid for by abolishing SERPS, which does not help  the poorest pensioners. People who have already built up SERPS entitlements "" of course still  receive their SERPS pension. Protecting the rights of members of occupational pension  schemes. We will provide a statutory framework of protection, including employee  representation on occupational pension trusts. Creating a comprehensive disability income  scheme to give people with disabilities real financial freedom. We will increase Invalidity  Benefit by 15%, extend mobility allowance and base payments on medical records rather than  National Insurance contributions. In the longer term we aim to reimburse individuals in full for  the additional costs of their disability. [A citizen's pension At present many people do not  receive the full basic state pension. If they have not paid enough tax because they have not  earned enough during their working lives, people have to rely on means-tested benefits when  they retire. Women in particular are badly affected, because they tend to have the lowest paid  jobs and to spend several years looking after children. Liberal Democrats believe that a  pension should be a right for everyone. We will ensure that the basic state pension is paid as of  right and end means testing for our poorest senior citizens.] [housing]. [We will introduce  Housing Cost Relief, weighted towards those in need and available to house buyers and  renters. People holding mortgages will have the choice of moving to housing cost relief or  continuing to receive mortgage interest tax relief.] Creating a Carer's Benefit for the many  individuals who forgo normal earnings to look after elderly or disabled relatives. We will  convert Invalid Care Allowance into a Carer's Benefit, increasing its value by an immediate  15%, indexing its future level to earnings and altering the entitlement rules to enable carers to  combine caring with part-time or even full-time jobs and to ensure that people will still be  eligible even if the caring starts after the carer reaches pensionable age. Further improvements  in benefits. We will, over the lifetime of a Parliament, phase out the differential in child benefit  between the first child and subsequent children; reintroduce death and maternity grants;  increase the family premium for income support and family credit, and reform the system of  cold-weather payments. Unifying income tax and employees' National Insurance contributions  so that the two taxes are collected and administered together and paid on the same income,  whether from earnings, investments, capital gains or perks. Making the investment needed to  end the recession, using the money borrowed by the Conservatives to pay for their  pre-election tax cuts. We will also raise the basic rate of income tax by one penny in the pound  to pay for the improvements essential to education. Our new tax rates will be as follows: -  About 80% of tax payers will pay 26% income tax plus the 9% from National Insurance (a  combined rate of 35%). - On earnings above 33,000, a combined rate of 42% will apply. - On  earnings above 50,000 a combined rate of 50% will be paid. - Pensioners and ordinary savers  will not pay the 9% National Insurance element on their incomes. Special provisions will also  ensure that those on modest incomes most of which comes from investments, such as people  who have been made redundant, do not pay this 9% on their savings. Widening horizons:  investing in the arts. The arts benefit society in two ways. First, access to the arts is intrinsic to  a high quality of life. Second, the cultural sector - the arts, crafts, design, and audio-visual  industries - makes as great a net contribution to the economy as does the oil industry. We will:  Create a new Ministry of Arts and Communications headed by a minister in the Cabinet.  Liberal Democrats will raise investment in the arts to the EC average over five years. Reform  and decentralise arts funding and organisation. We will decentralise many of the  responsibilities of the Arts Council, increasing the roles of Regional Arts Boards and local  authorities. Strengthen links between the arts and education. We will enhance practical arts  teaching and library provision in schools and extend the provision of adult education for the  arts and crafts. We will restore funding for public libraries to 1980 levels. We will abolish  museum charges for school parties. Transfer responsibility for broadcasting to the new  Ministry. The BBC is a major patron of the arts, and broadcasting itself combines a variety of  arts and crafts. We will reform recent legislation affecting the independent channels to  entrench the interests of quality broadcasting and to guarantee political independence. These  interests will also be reflected in the impending review of the BBC's Charter, and our plans for  cable television. Encourage participation within Europe- including in particular cooperation in  the film industry, in protecting and enhancing our common heritage and in expanding  opportunities for young artists of all kinds. Encouraging a fit, active and healthy society.  Sport is important for the economic, social and health benefits which it can bring and for its  ability to enhance community identity. Liberal Democrats will: Create a UK Sports  Commission to provide a voice for participants, spectators and administrators. State Sports  Councils will continue to receive their core funds from government but the Commission will  raise and distribute additional resources for the promotion of participation and excellence.  Encourage sport across the community. We will encourage school to invest in sports facilities  and open them up to the local community. We will establish Community Sports Plans offering  tax relief to sports clubs that share facilities and coaching resources with local schools. We  will encourage local authorities to transform football grounds into multi-sport venues.  Encourage individual and corporate sponsorship, review the role of the Foundation for Arts  and Sport and reconsider the Conservatives hasty proposal for a national lottery. [We will  fight discrimination by incorporating the European Convention on Human Rights into UK law  and then extending it into a full UK Bill of Rights.] Maintain Britain's leading role in the fight  against drug abuse in sport, ensuring adequate funding for testing programmes and education  campaigns directed at participants. Enhance safety in the provision of sports grounds. We will  put the safety of spectators first in any legislation and make standards mandatory. We will take  into account the size of grounds when setting safety standards. We will raise revenue for  investment in safety by increasing levies on football pools and betting. We will require local  authorities to include sports spectators on ground safety committees. Guaranteeing equal  opportunities. A forward-looking society places an equal value on the contribution of all its  citizens - and benefits from the participation of all. Yet in today's Britain many groups of  individuals are systematically discriminated against by a society which fails to recognise their  right to equality of opportunity. Liberal Democrats will: Fight discrimination by incorporating  the European Convention on Human Rights into UK law and then extending it into a full UK  Bill of Rights. This will reinforce existing protection in British courts against discrimination on  the grounds of sex, race, age, disability, religion or sexual orientation. We will set up a  Commission of Human Rights to assist individuals to take legal action in cases of  discrimination or other breaches of the rights guaranteed in the Convention. Strengthen the  rights of women. We will guarantee equal pay for work of equal value; require public  authorities and private contractors holding public contracts to be equal opportunity employers  and improve child-care support and facilities. Proportional representation for elections and  modernising Parliamentary procedures will help to end the discrimination against women on  elected bodies and in government at European, national and local levels. Extend the  opportunities of young people. We will entrench young people's rights of representation on  organisations which affect their lives and well-being such as college governing bodies. We will  place a statutory obligation on local authorities to provide a comprehensive youth service in  partnership with the voluntary sector, and we will invest in leisure and recreation facilities.  Young people will have the right to confidential medical advice and treatment. Make old age a  time of opportunity. We will introduce a flexible 'decade of retirement' for men and women, in  which people may choose to retire and take a state pension at any time between ages 60 and  70 (the value of the pension increasing with the age of retirement). We will increase choice for  elderly and retired people by encouraging openings in voluntary and part-time work, and  widening the availability of education, the arts and recreational facilities. Protect the rights of  ethnic minorities. We will reinforce legislation to ensure equal opportunities for all, in housing,  employment, education and training, especially in inner-city areas. PR will greatly increase the  possibilities of participation in the political process. We will repeal the 1981 Nationality Act,  reform immigration legislation to make it free from racial discrimination and restore the right  of entry to British passport holders. We will push for the extension of EC race discrimination  legislation and ensure that the rights of black and Asian British citizens are respected  throughout the EC. We will encourage changes to the education system which place a positive  value on a pluralist, diverse and multicultural society. Guarantee equal rights for gay men and  lesbians through changes to criminal law, anti-discrimination legislation and police practices.  We will repeal Section 28 of the 1988 Local Government Act. We will create a common age  of consent regardless of gender or sexual orientation. Work with people with disabilities and  their organisations to draw up a charter of rights for people with disabilities. We will  implement the 1986 Disabled Persons Act in full, giving priority to the development of  advocacy schemes. 5 Britain's partners: European partnership for the new century. Liberal  Democrats will take decisive steps towards a fully integrated, federal and democratic  European Community. We believe that by sharing sovereignty and pooling power, Britain and  its partners will be better able to achieve common goals for the economy, the environment,  society and security than by acting alone. Our aim is to create a citizens' Europe in which  power lies as close to the citizen as possible. Making Britain's European Presidency work.  Very few of the proposals that we have set out in the preceding sections will be successful  unless Britain is prepared to work in partnership within the Community. Following Maastricht,  yet again Britain risks being left behind while the rest of Europe moves on. Liberal Democrats  want Britain to play a full role in creating a dynamic and democratic Europe. We will use  Britain's six-month tenure of the Presidency of the Community's Council of Ministers to make  a start on the real tasks that lie ahead: building a prosperous and integrated economy;  correcting the democratic deficit, making Europe work for its citizens, not its institutions;  widening the Community's membership; and helping to create a peaceful and stable new world  order. We cannot expect Britain to influence the direction the Community takes in the next  decade unless it is a full and enthusiastic member. Our vision of the new Europe is of a federal  community, where power is exercised at the lowest level consistent with good government.  For us, federalism means decentralisation: passing powers down more than passing them up.  The creation of Scottish, Welsh and English regional Parliaments therefore goes hand in hand  with the promotion of more European cooperation and partnership, ensuring access to power  for individuals and their communities right across Europe. Building a citizens' Europe.  January 1993 will bring the single market. Economic and monetary union will follow by the  end of the decade. Yet the Community is still too much an organisation for businessmen and  bureaucrats instead of citizens and communities. We want to mould Europe's future in the  interests of Europe's people. Our priorities are: Economic and monetary union including the  establishment of an independent European Central Bank and a single European currency. We  will renounce the Conservatives' 'opt-out' clause and accept the timetable for EMU.  Cooperation in research and innovation. We will encourage further collaboration within the  EC on major scientific projects and the development of new technologies such as  telecommunications, information technology and environmentally sustainable innovations.  Action on the environment. Our environmental goals cannot be successfully achieved unless  action is taken across the Community. The proposed European Environment Agency must be  established, a European energy policy drawn up and environmental subsidies and penalties  applied Community-wide. An active regional and social policy. The single market and  economic and monetary union will expose regions and firms to greater competition. This will  be beneficial in the long run, but the EC must assist in the transitional period. We will  renounce Britain's social chapter 'opt-out' and argue for a more flexible framework of social  policy across the Community. The EC should set down minimum standards of health and  safety and employee rights, leaving national governments and enterprises to decide how to  meet them, subject ultimately to the judgement of the courts. Fundamental reform of the  Common Agricultural Policy. We will ease the transition from the present wasteful and  inefficient price support mechanism to market prices and direct support for farmers' incomes  to achieve environmental and social goals, to be funded by savings made from the present  intervention payment system. Creating a new democracy in Europe. The Community's  structure gives far too much weight to the Council of Ministers at the expense of the European  Parliament, and, most importantly, of the individual citizen. Further moves to European union,  and enlargement, must depend on the institutions of the EC becoming truly democratic. We  will: Set out the rights of the European citizen. We will work for a clear definition of the  rights of the European citizen, and insist that these are common to all Community nationals.  This must include common voting rights at local, national and European levels. Increase the  democratic powers of the European Parliament. We will ensure that the Parliament becomes  an effective partner with the Council in law-making, exercising in full the power of  'co-decision'. Introduce fair votes for the 1994 British elections to the European Parliament.  The British citizen must no longer be denied the fair voting systems enjoyed by the citizens of  every other European country. Make the Commission more accountable. The Parliament must  have the power to confirm or deny the Council's nominee as President of the Commission, and  then to approve or not the President's choice of Commissioners - and subsequently to sack  them if necessary. We welcome the provisions of the Maastricht Treaty as a first step.  Increase democracy and accountability in the Council of Ministers. We will argue to extend  majority voting in the Council to cover all areas of Community policy other than constitutional  and crucial security matters. When passing laws, the Council should meet in public. Improve  national scrutiny of Ministers' actions in Europe. We will create a new Europe Committee of  the House of Commons, and give our reformed House of Lords (see page 48) a special role in  scrutinising developments in the Community. Prepare for Community enlargement,  welcoming EFTA members and, when they are ready, the new democracies of Central and  Eastern Europe. A Community with more members requires reformed and dynamic  institutions. Sharing security; working for peace. The Gulf War and its aftermath have shown  the crucial need for stronger and more effective world institutions capable of upholding  international law and enforcing respect for human rights. Britain must ensure that the  Community plays a pivotal role in the construction of a new security order in Europe,  following the democratisation of Eastern and Central Europe. New initiatives for disarmament  and for sharing security burdens will enable further reductions in levels of armaments to be  made without endangering security. On the global stage, a stronger United Nations will be  needed to underpin cooperation in tackling the world's problems. We will: Develop common  European Community foreign and security policies. This will include a common approach to  defence procurement and the gradual integration of Community members' armed forces under  a joint military command. The burden of collective security in Western Europe should be  shared more equally; we will press for contributions from all nations to the costs of joint forces  such as NATO's proposed Rapid Reaction Force - of which Britain will provide almost half.  Promote democracy and reform in Eastern and Central Europe by co-ordinating generous  economic assistance to countries introducing democracy, guaranteeing human rights and  reforming their economies. Assist the peaceful evolution of the Commonwealth of  Independent States, the former USSR. We will help not just with food and financial aid and  technical assistance, but also with the provision of military resources to shift food and  supplies, and with scientific assistance to dismantle nuclear weapons. [Further moves to  European Union, and enlargement, must depend on the institutions of the European  Community becoming truly democratic.] Develop a pan-European security framework. We  will encourage the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe to develop monitoring,  verification and mediation duties within the continent. We will press for NATO to guarantee  the borders of Poland. Czechoslovakia and Hungary and to enter into talks with other  governments in the region for similar guarantees. Instigate a comprehensive review of UK  defence policy which will be dictated by a rigorous analysis of defence needs rather than by  fixed monetary targets. The Review will cover the continuing need for contributions to  collective security, the value of Britain's remaining extra-European commitments, and the  potential for increasing our contribution to UN peacekeeping missions. Given the present  hopeful international situation, we believe that further reductions in levels of armaments will  be able to be made without in any way endangering security. Since the review will set out the  framework for defence policy for years to come, we will halt any defence cut, and any order  for a new weapons system, which might prejudice its outcome. Establish an Arms Conversion  Agency to help arms manufacturers to diversify and convert out of the defence field, funded by  savings made in the defence budget. Our proposed regional development agencies will also  provide help to areas particularly affected. We will reduce spending on military research and  development, and shift the resources saved into the civilian sector. Maintain a minimum  nuclear deterrent. We believe that the UK needs to retain its independent nuclear deterrent,  but that the escalation of firepower represented by the scale of the Trident replacement for  Polaris is unnecessary and unhelpful. We will ensure that the total number of warheads on the  four-boat Trident system is limited to no more than that currently deployed on the Polaris  system, and our Defence Review will consider whether we can reduce this further without  threatening security. Our Review will also examine the possibilities of future European  cooperation in the provision of a deterrent force. We reject the Government's proposed  replacement of British free-fall nuclear bombs with air-to-surface missiles. Propose new  disarmament initiatives covering all categories of conventional and nuclear weapons. These  will aim to eliminate non-strategic nuclear weapons from Europe, and to reduce the strategic  weapons possessed by the US, the former Soviet Union, Britain, France and China - a vital  step towards the day when individual nations possession of nuclear deterrents ceases to be  necessary. Act against the arms trade. Together with our Community partners, we will  establish a register of all international arms sales, eventually to become a UN register. We will  place a total embargo on arms sales to regimes which violate human rights, and work for  further global agreements among suppliers to control arms sales and technology transfer. We  will close the Defence Export Services Organisation and ensure that overseas aid is not linked  in any way to arms purchases. Make the United Nations more effective. The UN Security  Council should take a proactive role in peacekeeping before confrontation develops into  conflict. We will work with our Community partners to ensure that funds are available for  maintaining peace and security. The UN Military Staff Committee should be reinstated and a  permanent peacekeeping force established, with member states contributing contingents on an  annual basis. Because of the need to assign British forces to this and to European policing and  disaster roles (on top of their present commitments), more general purpose infantry battalions  will be required than the number currently planned by the Conservative Government.  Developing global prosperity. A secure, democratic and peaceful world can never be created  while so much of the globe remains so desperately poor. Britain must play its part in  developing prosperity, protecting the world environment, eradicating poverty, famine and  disease, and promoting human rights and international cooperation. This will include:  Increasing overseas aid to reach the UN target of 0_7% of GNP over five years. We will  increase aid especially to democratic countries carrying out policies which benefit the poorest,  are environmentally sustainable and respect human rights. We will raise the proportion of aid  given as grants instead of loans and place greater emphasis on supporting small-scale,  community-based, labour-intensive projects. We will promote closer European cooperation, to  make the best use of national and Community aid, and avoid wasteful duplication. We will  rejoin UNESCO. Ending the commercialisation of aid which the current Government has  practised and which substantially reduces its value to the world's poorest. We will reduce the  proportion of UK aid tied to the purchase of UK goods and services and ensure that help to  British exports is solely a function of the Department of Trade and Industry, rather than the  ODA. Encouraging environmentally sustainable development. This includes the transfer of  appropriate technology, the development of sustainable agriculture and forestry, sustainable  use policies for the tropical rain forests and projects to prevent desertification, and the  promotion of energy conservation and renewable energy schemes. We will provide technical  help to develop methods of resource accounting and environmental protection and ensure that  measures of sustainability are incorporated in decisions on development projects and  programmes. Urgent action to tackle the growth in the world's population. Having doubled in  the past fifty years to five billion, the world's population is expected to increase by a further  one billion in the 1990s alone. We will give priority to support for family-planning  programmes, education and employment opportunities for women, and basic provision for old  age. Reform of the world trading and financial systems. We see the successful conclusion of  the Uruguay round of the GATT world trade talks as an urgent priority. Global prosperity also  requires the reversal of the net flow of resources from the global South. We will press the EC  to co-ordinate international action to resolve the debt crisis, including reducing  government-to-government debt, introducing regulatory and tax regimes to encourage  commercial banks to reduce or write off debt, extending eligibility to IMF and World Bank  loans, and encouraging, where appropriate, debt for development and debt for environment  swaps. We will press for the progressive reduction of all tariff and non-tariff trade barriers,  and in particular the removal of unfair trading barriers against developing countries. 6  Britain's democracy: electoral and constitutional reform. Liberal Democrats, alone in British  politics, recognise that unless we change Britain's system of government, we cannot change  Britain's future. Without constitutional reform, we will not achieve our other objectives. We  believe in citizenship, not subjecthood - in the ability of all individuals to exercise power over  the institutions that govern their lives. The creation of a modernised democracy therefore lies  at the heart of all our proposals. We recognise too that Britain's success in the next century  will depend not just on changing what we do, but in changing the way in which we do it.  However worthy its intentions, and however able its personnel, no government will be able to  put Britain right unless and until it has modernised our constitution. Fair voting for an  effective Parliament. Our current 'winner takes all' system of voting has many faults. It is  unfair, unstable and divisive. Government by minority is usually bad government: in no truly  democratic country could a disaster like the poll tax have been pushed through in defiance of  public opinion, wasting billions of pounds and causing misery to millions of people. Our top  priority is therefore the introduction of fair votes for all elections at all levels of government.  Fair votes will make every elector's vote count  It will increase citizens' control over their elected representatives, by abolishing safe seats  It will eradicate the power of the extremist minority in political parties  It will lead to a better choice of candidates and ensure that more women and candidates from  minority ethnic communities are elected  Above all, it will reduce tit-for-tat politics and introduce much greater stability into  government, allowing individuals and businesses alike to plan for their future with confidence  We will: Bring in fair votes  We will introduce proportional representation for all elections at local, national and European  levels  We propose the single transferable vote, by which electors cast their votes in multi-member  constituencies based on natural communities  Introduce fixed-term Parliaments of four years, with a known date for the next election,  subject to an earlier election only if the government loses a special 'explicit' vote of no  confidence  Reform the House of Lords  We will maintain a second chamber as a Senate, primarily elected by the citizens of the  nations and regions of the United Kingdom  It will have power to delay all legislation other than money bills for up to two years  Improve the way Parliament works  We will give MPs greater influence over the executive by boosting the powers of Select  Committees, improving staff backup for backbenchers and increasing financial and civil service  support for opposition parties  We will improve the quality of legislation by establishing pre-legislative committees and better  scrutiny of delegated legislation  We will improve the quality of debates by allocating time for business more fairly, timetabling  Committee sessions of bills and ending Parliament's late-night sittings  Bringing power to the people  Our system of government is far too centralised, and fails to make effective use of the talents  and skills available across the country  We believe that political power is best exercised at the most local level possible, consistent  with good government  We will: Introduce Home Rule for Scotland, with the immediate creation of an elected  Scottish Parliament  Introduce Home Rule for Wales, with the immediate creation of an elected Welsh Senedd  Reform and strengthen local government, removing unnecessary tiers, restoring councils'  independence and ensuring they are accountable to the people through a fair voting system  Create the framework for regional government in England  We will enable the establishment of fully democratic regional governments throughout  England  We will set up a Strategic Authority for London as a priority  Preceding the new regional governments, we will establish regional development agencies  throughout England, helping to boost economic development and prosperity  Decentralise power to the new national and regional governments  Economic development, housing, health, social services, roads and public transport, education  and planning are functions which should be devolved from Whitehall and brought nearer the  people they most affect  Strengthening local government  The current Government's approach to local government finance - most notably through the  poll tax fiasco - has been to destroy the independence of local authorities by reducing their  powers to raise and spend revenue  The Liberal Democrat approach is exactly the opposite: we aim to take power away from  Westminster and Whitehall, giving new powers to stronger, more independent and more  democratic local councils - elected by fair votes  We will: Abolish the poll tax, cancel plans for the proposed Council Tax and introduce a  Local Income Tax, related to ability to pay and collected by the Inland Revenue  Local Income Tax is easy to understand, easy to administer, and fair  It works effectively in many other countries  Replace the Uniform Business Rate with Site Value Rating - locally administered and based  on the taxation of land values (with exemption for agricultural land and domestic properties)  This will create incentives to improve property, rather than leave it undeveloped  Administration will be easier and local accountability will be restored  Reform and strengthen local government  We will reform principal local councils into a unitary system based on natural communities  and the wishes of local people  We will give the new authorities greater responsibilities - for example, over education, health,  and planning - and freedom to ensure the delivery of services in ways they think best  Local authorities will be given a 'general power of competence', which will allow them to  carry out any beneficial local action which neither duplicates the work of other public bodies  nor breaks the law  Bring local government nearer to the people, by enabling the formation of a full network of  community, parish, town or neighbourhood councils  We will ensure that all tiers of regional and local government publish a 'Charter of Services',  giving citizens clear rights to standards of service, and remedies if these are not met  [Consulting local citizens Liberal Democrats want local councils to be as responsive and  accountable to their local citizens as possible  We will introduce across the country an initiative pioneered by Liberal Democrat-run councils  such as South Somerset and Richmond  We will require every council to conduct an annual survey of all its residents to gauge their  views on the quality of local services  A summary of the results of the survey, compared to the previous year's findings, will be  published with the annual demand for local income tax, so that every resident is able to tell  what their council is achieving with the money they pay  ] Ensuring citizens' rights and opportunities  No citizen is truly free unless all are  Individual citizens and minority communities themselves need protection against the power of  the state and against discrimination and unfair treatment  Citizens must have rights of access to information about decisions taken by public authorities  in their name  We will: Introduce a Freedom of Information Act, placing responsibility on government and  other authorities to justify secrecy  We will reverse the present Government's encroachments on freedom of speech and  association, such as the banning of trade unions at GCHQ  We will legislate to give individuals the right of access to their personal files, except in  matters relating to national security, whether held by public or private bodies  Security services and intelligence agencies should be accountable to a committee of senior  Privy Councillors  Enact a Bill of Rights by immediately incorporating the European Convention on Human  Rights and its protocols into UK law  We will create a Commission of Human Rights to help people bring proceedings under the  Bill and to recommend changes in existing law and practice  In due course we will add rights and freedoms not currently included in the Convention,  extending into a full UK Bill of Rights  Take tougher action against discrimination  Our Bill of Rights will guarantee effective protection against discrimination on the grounds of  sex, race, age, disability, religion or sexual orientation  Our Commission of Human Rights will help individuals take legal action in cases of  discrimination  End the bias against women's participation in the present political system  The introduction of fair votes and of sensible Parliamentary conditions will increase both the  number of women candidates and the number of women MPs  In addition, we will use government's powers of appointment to ensure fair representation of  women public bodies  Improve the administration of the legal system with the establishment of a Ministry of Justice,  separating responsibility for civil liberties and justice from that for order and security  We will establish a Judicial Services Commission to appoint judges  Adopt a written constitution, of which the Bill of Rights will form the centrepiece  We will create a Supreme Court to entrench and defend these fundamental reforms to the  relationship between the citizen and the state  Working for peace: Northern Ireland  Liberal Democrats reject simplistic solutions for Northern Ireland  We aim to confront the legitimate fears and aspirations of both communities  We accept that both the Unionist and Nationalist traditions are valid and legitimate; that  Northern Ireland should remain a part of the UK until the free consent of the majority of its  people is given to change; that the Republic of Ireland has a legitimate interest in the future of  Northern Ireland; and that a partnership in government which allows both communities to  participate is the only practical way in which to make progress  Together with the Alliance Party, our sister party and the only non-sectarian political party in  Northern Ireland, we believe that mutual respect, shared responsibilities and decentralised  government are the only basis for a lasting solution to the troubles of Northern Ireland  We will work together to: Maintain the Anglo-Irish Agreement, unless and until an improved  agreement emerges from cross-party talks to replace it  Strengthen the constitutional rights of individuals within Northern Ireland  The case for fair voting for all elections, to bring together communities and encourage  cooperation, and for a Bill of Rights to protect individuals, is even more pressing in Northern  Ireland than it is in the rest of the UK  We will reform the Diplock system, so that three judges preside over non-jury trials, and  encourage the use of juries wherever possible  We will introduce a 110-day limit on the length of time for which a prisoner may be held  before trial, repeal the broadcasting ban, and provide for the videotaping of police interviews  with terrorist suspects  Support community-based organisations striving for peace and reconciliation and working to  eliminate sectarianism and discrimination in religious life, education, housing and politics  Welcome the opportunities offered by the development of the European Community, in terms  of economic assistance to Northern Ireland and also because it creates a framework for  progress in the relationship between the UK and the Republic of Ireland  Our Pledge  What has been set out in these pages is a programme which could change Britain for good  We could become a country of citizens, not subjects, striving for excellence rather than  settling for second best  We could be economically prosperous, environmentally responsible and educated to our full  potential  But the obstacle to national success is the British system of government itself  Until that outdated charade is swept away, Britain's decline will continue, whatever  government may be in power  That is why Liberal Democrats are putting constitutional change at the heart of our election  campaign  The reform of our outdated and undemocratic voting system in particular is the change which  will make other reforms possible and is the key to a successful future  Because we believe in stable democratic government supported by a majority of the British  people, we shall not only campaign wholeheartedly for fair votes in the coming weeks, we also  make a pledge for the period after the election  Our aim will be the creation of stable government for a whole Parliament and a more  democratic basis for future elections  Liberal Democrats will neither support nor participate in a government which turns its back  on reform  Any minority government which tries to play games with the constitution in order to cling to  power, promoting instability and dodging the moral challenge of democracy, will have to  contend with us  That is our pledge"
"Conservatives",199204,"The Best Future for Britain  FOREWORD  At the end of this Parliament a new Millennium will be in view We must raise our sights high. This Manifesto is about making our country respected and secure, and helping you achieve a better; safer and more prosperous future. For I believe - strongly - that you, and not the Government, should be in charge of your life. That's what Conservatism stands for. That principle underlies all the policies in this Manifesto.  I believe in a responsible society Government's duties are clear: to protect Britain in a dangerous world; to look after those who cannot look after themselves; to protect law-abiding people from crime and disorder; and to protect the value of our currency - without which all spending pledges are worthless and all savings at risk.  But I believe also in a society in which government doesn't try to take responsibility away from people. Politicians must never make the mistake of thinking the state always knows best, or that it is entitled to the lion's share of people's money I believe in low taxes not just because they ignite enterprise - the spark of economic growth - but because they put power and choice where it belongs: in your hands.  So when you compare what the politicians are saying in this election, ask yourself these questions. Whom do you trust to take responsibility for Britain's defence; to keep us safe and strengthen our influence for good? And who, at the same time, wants to give you the opportunity to do your best for yourself and your family?  Who will give you the power to choose - to say for yourself what you want? And who will give you the personal prosperity that comes from low taxes - from your own savings, your own pension, your own home? Who will let you build up your own stake in Britain's success - and pass it on to your children?  Only Conservatives can truly claim to be the party of opportunity; choice; ownership and responsibility. Socialists like to keep people under the government's thumb. Conservatives want to give them independence. But we also want to put government at your service, giving you what you've paid for - good public services, responsible to you.  I do not believe the answer to every problem is simply for government to dig deeper in your pocket. I believe it often lies in changing the way government works; in making it respond to you. Government should look outwards. It should listen. It should put you in the know not keep you in the dark.  We have made quite a start, under the seal of the Citizen's Charter People in schools, hospitals, public offices of all kinds are rising to the challenge. I knew they would. They just needed encouragement, incentive and a system that is outward-looking too.  It is all part of a revolution in quality in Britain. British goods are once more winning in the toughest markets abroad. There is new vigour in the businesses liberated from state ownership; better management and better industrial relations. These are the firm foundations of economic recovery  We are raising the quality of our education and training. We are raising the standard of our housing, as more people own and improve their own homes. We are concerned for the quality of our environment. And in government, we are leading a drive for quality throughout our public services.  That, I believe, is the way we all want to live - a decent life in a civilised community. That is the way we can live: celebrating our achievements, not nurturing old grudges; enjoying our successes, not talking Britain down. We can be free of old prejudices and class bafflers. We can encourage diversity, not division; achievement, not antagonism. We can all make our own contribution to the success of the United Kingdom; and we must keep that kingdom united.  You know I believe in choice. And in this election, as always, there is another choice. You can vote for our opponents, and watch them take Britain back to the 1970s. Back to socialism. Back to strikes. Back to strife. Back to the world's pity, or worse still, contempt. I don't believe Britain wants that. I know the world doesn't want that for Britain.  I hope you will choose a different path - to go forward, not back; to go for the best, knowing that Britain can be the best and do it best. My belief is clean Only the best is good enough for Britain.

Communism has collapsed in Eastern Europe, and the Soviet Union has fallen apart. Everywhere Socialism is in retreat and democracy, human rights and market economics are advancing. The authority of the UN has been bolstered and Iraqi aggression seen off. Talks are under way in the Middle East and South Africa. It is a time of great opportunity, but also of new dangers.  Britain needs firm leadership at this time. We must be represented by a team of quality and experience. A team which can help shape the world for the next century A Conservative team.  Under the Conservatives, Britain has regained her rightful influence in the world. We have stood up for the values our country has always represented. We have defended Britain's interests with vigour and with success.  The respect with which Britain is regarded in the world has rarely been higher. We play a central part in world affairs as a member of the European Community, NATO, the Commonwealth and the Group of 7 leading industrial countries, and as a Permanent Member of the UN Security Council. No other country holds all these positions.  We are taking a leading role in recasting all the main international institutions to which we belong: the United Nations, the European Community, NATO, and the Commonwealth. The Prime Minister convened the first ever meeting of the UN Security Council at Heads of Government level. Between now and the end of 1992 there will be seven Summits where issues of critical importance to our future will be determined: two EC Councils, at Lisbon and Edinburgh, the G7 Summit, the CSCE Summit, EC Summits with the US and Japan, and the Earth Summit at Rio de Janeiro. Britain will be at the centre of these negotiations.  THE NEED FOR LEADERSHIP  The end of the Cold War has enabled the UN to act with new unity and authority Under the authority of the UN, British forces played a leading and courageous part in the Gulf War and the liberation of Kuwait. At the Prime Minister's instigation, the UN also backed the operation to protect the Kurds.  Britain has led the world in helping the reforms in the former Soviet Union. The Prime Minister gave full and immediate support to President Yeltsin in the August coup attempt, and was the first Western leader to visit Moscow after the coup failed. Britain has led the way in building up relations with the republics of the new Commonwealth of Independent States. We have provided valuable economic and humanitarian aid to ease the transition to a market economy  - WE WILL SUPPORT AN ENHANCED ROLE FOR THE UN IN PEACE-KEEPING AND COMBATING STATE-SPONSORED TERRORISM.  - WE ARE DETERMINED THAT IRAQ SHOULD COMPLY WITH THE TERMS OF THE GUFF WAR CEASE-FIRE AGREEMENT, AND IN PARTICULAR THAT IT SHOULD CO-OPERATE WITH THE UN IN DISMANTLING ITS WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION.  - WE SUPPORT EARLY RUSSIAN MEMBERSHIP OF THE IMF AND WORLD BANK, AS WELL AS A STABILISATION FUND FOR THE ROUBLE.  - WE ARE CO-OPERATING WITH OUR PARTNERS TO PROVIDE URGENT HELP TO THE FORMER SOVIET UNION AND EASTERN EUROPE TO UPGRADE THE SAFETY OF THEIR NUCLEAR POWER STATIONS.  - WE STRONGLY SUPPORT THE PEACE PROCESS IN THE MIDDLE EAST. THE OUTCOME OF THE TALKS MUST SAFEGUARD THE SECURITY OF ISRAEL AND ACHIEVE SELF-DETERMINATION FOR THE PEOPLE OF THE OCCUPIED TERRITORIES.  - WE WILL SAFEGUARD THE PROSPERITY OF HONG KONG, NURTURE DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS AND WORK WITH THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT WITHIN THE TERMS OF THE JOINT DECLARATION.  - WE SEEK A SOLUTION TO THE DISPUTE WHICH HAS DIVIDED CYPRUS SINCE 1974. A SETTLEMENT MUST RECOGNISE THAT CYPRUS IS INDIVISIBLE AND THAT THE RIGHTS OF BOTH COMMUNITIES MUST BE ASSURED. WE WILL SUPPORT THE UN'S EFFORTS TO SECURE A FAIR AND LASTING SOLUTION.  - THE PROBLEMS OF KASHMIR CANNOT BE RESOLVED BY VIOLENCE. WE URGE BOTH INDIA AND PAKISTAN TO ADDRESS AND RESOLVE THE ISSUE, AND WE STAND READY TO HELP.  OUR INFLUENCE FOR GOOD  All over the world countries are turning to democracy and free markets. Last October in Harare, the Commonwealth took on a new role as a promoter of democracy the rule of law, and respect for individual freedoms. Already the Commonwealth is monitoring elections to ensure that they are free and fair. Britain is taking the lead in encouraging these trends.  We give substantial aid to the relief of poverty and to help the struggling economies of the developing world. Our aid programme next year (excluding aid to Eastern Europe and the CIS) will reach £1,800 million. Britain also makes more direct private investment in the developing world than any other EC country - some £2,400 million in 1989. We are urging the international community to take decisive action on debt relief, the liberalisation of world trade and support for good government.  We continue to accept the long term UN target for aid of 0.7 per cent of GNP, although we cannot set a timetable for its achievement. The quality of Britain's overseas aid programme is second to none. It is well targeted and highly effective. Eighty per cent of our bilateral aid goes to the poorest countries. New aid to the poorest is given as grants, not loans.  We are supporting projects designed to build efficient institutions and accountable government. We are helping to improve public administration and the legal system in a number of countries.  The English language is one of our nation's greatest assets - culturally politically and commercially The BBC World Service has unrivalled standing around the globe. The British Council acts as a cultural ambassador for Britain and for the English language.  - WE WILL USE OVERSEAS AID TO PROMOTE GOOD GOVERNMENT, SENSIBLE ECONOMIC POLICIES, THE ROOTING OUT OF CORRUPTION, AND - CRUCIALLY - RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS AND THE RULE OF LAW.  - WE WILL PRESS CREDITOR COUNTRIES TO ACCEPT THE PRIME MINISTER'S PROPOSAL - THE 'TRINIDAD TERMS' - FOR A TWO-THIRDS REDUCTION IN THE OFFICIAL DEBT OF THE POOREST COUNTRIES.  - WE WILL PROMOTE THE DEVELOPMENT OF MULTI- PARTY SYSTEMS THROUGH THE NEW WESTMINSTER FOUNDATION FOR DEMOCRACY.  - WE WILL PROMOTE THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE BY STRENGTHENING BOTH THE BRITISH COUNCIL AND THE BBC WORLD SERVICE. WE WILL ENCOURAGE BOTH TO BECOME MORE ENTREPRENEURIAL IN ORDER TO FINANCE THEIR ACTIVITIES IN DEVELOPING MARKETS.  THE RISKS WE FACE NOW  The collapse of the old Soviet Union has dramatically vindicated Conservative defence policy. We have always put the security of our country first. We have kept the peace by staying strong.  Today the threat of a massive surprise attack from Eastern Europe has gone. But we still face grave risks to our security. We cannot drop our guard. Under the Conservatives, Britain will never do so.  Within the former Soviet Union there remains a huge military force. Democracy and the rule of law are yet to be firmly established. Control over these armed forces and the massive nuclear capability is uncertain. The events in Yugoslavia show what can happen when Communism collapses in disorder.  Increasingly threats come from outside Europe - as we saw so clearly in the Gulf. Many more countries are acquiring large stocks of modern arms. Some are trying to obtain nuclear, biological and chemical weapons. Britain must be able to respond to any unexpected danger.  The Conservatives are the only party who recognise both the opportunities and the threats of the new world.  For over forty years, our security has been based firmly on NATO, the most successful defensive alliance ever. We will work with our allies to ensure that NATO remains the cornerstone of our defence. Britain will command a new NATO Rapid Reaction Corps ready to deploy quickly to counter any sudden threat. As Europeans we must accept a greater role in safeguarding the peace in our continent.  We will promote arms control and reduction initiatives. On Britain's initiative, the UN is establishing a register of arms transfers in order to monitor any dangerous arsenals of weapons.  Britain has always been strongly opposed to nuclear proliferation. We will back an enhanced role for the International Atomic Energy Agency in inspecting nuclear sites and for the UN Security Council in acting against those nations which break their non proliferation obligations.  - WE WILL WORK TO STRENGTHEN THE WESTERN EUROPEAN UNION AS THE EUROPEAN PILLAR OF NATO. WE WILL PRESS FOR A EUROPEAN REACTION FORCE.  - WE WILL INTENSIFY THE CO-ORDINATION OF SECURITY POLICIES WITHIN THE TWELVE.  - WE WILL WORK THROUGH THE CSCE TO SAFEGUARD THE SECURITY OF EUROPE.  - WE WILL SUPPORT A COMPREHENSIVE AND VERIFIABLE BAN ON CHEMICAL WEAPONS, AND FURTHER CONTROLS ON THE EXPORT OF ITEMS WHICH COULD BE USED IN MAKING BIOLOGICAL WEAPONS.  - WE WILL HELP RUSSIA IN HER EFFORTS TO DISMANTLE NUCLEAR WEAPONS.  OUR ARMED FORCES  Only the Conservatives can be trusted to maintain the quality and capability of our Armed Forces. We are proud of the skill, courage and professionalism which they displayed in the Gulf and which they show daily in Northern Ireland.  We are the only party unambiguously committed to the preservation and modernisation of our independent nuclear deterrent.  Our defence would be unsafe in the hands of the opposition parties. Labour have opposed our defence policies at every turn. They have twisted and turned in their attitude to our nuclear deterrent. They would devastate our conventional forces by cuts of at least 27 per cent, which would lead to huge job losses in the defence industries.  The Liberal Democrats would cause even more damage to Britain's defences. Their aim is to cut our defence spending by half by the end of the decade.  We insist that our forces have the modern, effective equipment that they need. The Gulf War showed that the Services must have the latest technology to give them maximum flexibility and mobility. That is why we have ordered the new Challenger II tank for the Army, the Merlin helicopter for the Navy, the ASRAAM air defence missile for the RAF and a wide range of other new equipment for our Forces.  Our reappraisal of Britain's defence needs will result an a major restructuring of our Armed Forces to take account of the changing world situation. In future our Forces will be smaller, but better equipped. Our Services deserve the excellent pay and conditions which we have secured for them and will maintain.  - WE WILL COMPLETE THE DEPLOYMENT OF THE NEXT GENERATION OF BRITAIN'S MINIMUM NUCLEAR DETERRENT. WE WILL ORDER AND COMPLETE THE FOURTH TRIDENT SUBMARINE.  - WE WILL ENSURE THE FORCES HAVE THE BEST AND MOST MODERN EQUIPMENT.  - WE WILL IMPROVE THE QUALITY AND MANAGEMENT OF SERVICE HOUSING AND HELP THOSE IN THE FORCES SAVE TOWARDS BUYING A HOME OF THEIR OWN.  - THE RESERVES WILL PLAY AN EVEN MORE IMPORTANT ROLE AND WE WILL INTRODUCE LEGISLATION TO ALLOW THEIR MORE FLEXIBLE USE.  THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITY  The Conservatives have been the party of Britain in Europe for 30 years. We have argued when argument was necessary; but we have not wavered nor changed our views. We have ensured that Britain is at the heart of Europe; a strong and respected partner.  We have played a decisive part in the development of the Community over the past decade. It was a British initiative which launched the Single Market programme and our insistence which reformed the Community's finances. Britain has promoted co-operation on foreign policy and in combating terrorism. Britain has also persuaded our partners to welcome new countries who apply for Community membership.  The Maastricht Treaty was a success both for Britain and for the rest of Europe. British proposals helped to shape the key provisions of the Treaty including those strengthening the enforcement of Community law defence, subsidiarity and law and order. But Britain refused to accept the damaging Social Chapter proposed by other Europeans, and it was excluded from the Maastricht treaty  All Member States must live up to their obligations under Community law. At Maastricht, we secured agreement that the European Court will be able to fine any Member State which fails to do so.  - WE WILL WORK CLOSELY WITH OUR PARTNERS IN FOREIGN POLICY AND IN THE WAR ON INTERNATIONAL CRIME.  - WE WILL CONTINUE TO RESIST CHANGES TO THE TREATY OF ROME THAT WOULD DAMAGE BRITISH BUSINESS.  - WE WILL RESIST COMMISSION INITIATIVES WHICH RUN COUNTER TO THE PRINCIPLE THAT ISSUES SHOULD BE DEALT WITH ON A NATIONAL BASIS WHEREVER POSSIBLE.  - BRITAIN IS A GREAT TRADING NATION. WE PROSPER THROUGH THE MAINTENANCE OF AN OPEN TRADING SYSTEM. WE WILL WORK FOR A SUCCESSFUL OUTCOME TO THE GATT NEGOTIATIONS.  - WE WILL REDOUBLE OUR EFFORTS TO REFORM THE COMMON AGRICULTURAL POLICY AND WILL STOUTLY DEFEND THE INTERESTS OF BRITISH FARMERS AND CONSUMERS.  - WE WILL INSIST ON MORE EFFECTIVE CONTROL OVER COMMUNITY SPENDING AND WILL RESIST PRESSURE TO EXTEND COMMUNITY COMPETENCE TO NEW AREAS.  - WE WILL WORK TO STRENGTHEN THE EXTERNAL FRONTIERS OF THE COMMUNITY WHILST MAINTAINING THE CHECKS NEEDED AT OUR OWN BORDERS AGAINST ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION, DRUGS, TERRORISM AND DISEASE.  THE BRITISH PRESIDENCY  In the second half of 1992 Britain will take the Chair of the Council of Ministers. The British Presidency comes at a turning point in the Community's history. It gives us the opportunity to shape the direction of the Community and to establish its priorities. We shall use it to promote our vision of an outward looking Community based on free enterprise.  Our Presidency will reach its climax at the Edinburgh meeting of the European Council, which we will hold in the historic palace of Holyrood House. While the attention of Europe is focused on Edinburgh, the strength of our Union will be visible to all.  OUR PRIORITIES WILL BE:  - TO START NEGOTIATIONS WITH THOSE EFTA COUNTRIES WHO WANT TO JOIN THE COMMUNITY SO THAT THEY CAN JOIN BY 1995.  - TO BUILD ON THE EC'S ASSOCIATION AGREEMENTS WITH CZECHOSLOVAKIA, HUNGARY AND POLAND SO THAT WE CAN WELCOME THEM TO FULL MEMBERSHIP BY THE YEAR 2000.  - TO CONCLUDE EC TRADE AND CO-OPERATION AGREEMENTS WITH THE MAIN REPUBLICS OF THE FORMER SOVIET UNION.  - TO COMPLETE THE SINGLE MARKET AND EXTEND IT TO THE SEVEN COUNTRIES OF EFTA- OVER HALF OUR TRADE IS WITH THE REST OF THE COMMUNITY. THE SINGLE MARKET WILL CREATE AN OPEN MARKET OF 350 MILLION CUSTOMERS FOR BRITISH GOODS AND SERVICES. TO COMPLETE THE SINGLE MARKET WE SHALL AIM TO:  - OPEN UP THE MARKET FOR LIFE INSURANCE TO FREE COMPETITION;  - LIBERALISE AIR TRAVEL TO BRING DOWN AIR FARES IN EUROPE CLOSER TO THOSE IN AMERICA;  - FREE UP THE SHIPPING AND ROAD TRANSPORT MARKETS SO THAT BRITISH OPERATORS CAN CARRY FREELY WITHIN THE EC;  - INCREASE COMPETITION IN THE EUROPEAN ENERGY SECTOR.  - WE WILL PROVIDE GUIDANCE AND HELP TO ANY BRITISH COMPANY ENCOUNTERING A TRADE BARRIER ILLEGAL UNDER EUROPEAN LAW.  - WE WILL PRESS FOR PROGRESS ON THE ENVIRONMENT, INCLUDING THE FIFTH ENVIRONMENT ACTION PROGRAMME.  - WE WILL CHAIR THE NEGOTIATIONS ON THE FUTURE SPENDING PRIORITIES OF THE COMMUNITY TO ENSURE VALUE FOR MONEY. WE WILL SAFEGUARD THE ABATEMENT NEGOTIATED BY MRS THATCHER WHICH HAS SO FAR BROUGHT SOME £12,000 MILLION IN BUDGET REBATES TO BRITAIN.  WEALTH AND OWNERSHIP  The 1990s present a great economic opportunity for Britain. We have got the scourge of inflation under control. We have cut direct tax rates. And a stable currency gives industry a chance to realise the potential released by the reforms of the 1980s.  We have extended ownership more widely - of homes, savings and shares - with millions more sharing directly in Britain's success. We will promote enterprise through low taxes, sound money and a stable currency.  When the Exchange Rate Mechanism was being created, during the final days of the last Labour Government, the then Prime Minister decided Britain could not take part.  It was easy to see why The economy was too weak. Inflation was too high. In 1974-79, the inflation rate averaged over 15 per cent. It peaked at 27 per cent. Public borrowing rose to nearly 10 per cent of national income - equivalent to £55,000 million today Penal taxes blunted enterprise. Britain was a byword for strikes.  The Conservatives have changed all that. Since 1979, our inflation rate has averaged 7½ per cent. Now it is only just over 4 per cent - below the average for the European Community In the 1960s and 1970s, Britain had the slowest growth rate in the European Community. But in the 1980s, we grew faster than either France or Germany Industrial disputes became rare events. And in 1990, a Conservative Government joined the ERM.  Penal taxes have been abolished. A man on average earnings, with a wife and two children, has an income today which after tax and inflation is 39 per cent higher than it was in Labour's last year. That great advance in the standard of living is at risk in this election.  Since the war, living standards have always risen faster under Conservative Governments than under Labour. Now we are pledged to cut tax rates again - and have made a start on the road to 20p Income Tax.  Corporate tax rates have been cut, too. Our business investment has increased more rapidly than in any other major economy except Japan. Britain attracts by far the biggest share of Japanese and American investment in Europe. That, too, is at risk in this election.  BRITAIN'S OPPORTUNITY  We are now members of:  - The biggest free market in the world. British industry is again respected in Europe.  - A zone of low inflation, in which we can compete with the best.  Britain must not throw this opportunity away by electing a Labour government. The world recession has been tough for all of us, at home and abroad. Unemployment has risen. But in Britain we have laid the foundations for recovery What is needed to trigger confidence and growth is a Conservative victory with a decisive majority. What would postpone recovery, and turn this promise of growth into the certainty of hard times, is the election of our opponents whose policies would mean higher taxes, higher inflation, higher interest rates, more bureaucratic regulation and more strikes.  IN THE 1990S, THE GOVERNMENT'S TASK WILL BE TO PROVIDE AN ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT WHICH ENCOURAGES ENTERPRISE - THE MAINSPRING OF PROSPERITY. OUR AIMS MUST BE:  - TO ACHIEVE PRICE STABILITY.  - TO KEEP FIRM CONTROL OVER PUBLIC SPENDING.  - TO CONTINUE TO REDUCE TAXES AS FAST AS WE PRUDENTLY CAN.  - TO MAKE SURE THAT MARKET MECHANISMS AND INCENTIVES ARE ALLOWED TO DO THEIR JOB.  Price stability does not mean a frozen economy in which no price ever moves. But we must drive inflation down so low that it no longer affects the decisions made by ordinary people, businesses and government.  When inflation rises, so do bankruptcies. When inflation falls, industry can plan again for a profitable future. Inflation creates strife, as different groups in society struggle to restore their living standards. It destroys jobs. It erodes savings and social benefits and threatens our currency.  INFLATION AND EUROPE  Membership of the ERM is now central to our counter-inflation discipline. But the ERM is not a magic wand. It would not protect Labour; it would merely expose the folly of Labour policies. Some Labour politicians know that all too well - others simply don't. They - and some of the unions - would put irresistible spending pressure on a Labour government.  Some members of the European Community are anxious to hurry on from the ERM to Economic and Monetary Union. Others have doubts. Quite apart from the constitutional issues, they do not want to take risks with what is being achieved in the ERM.  The Treaty negotiated at Maastricht laid down the process under which the Community can, if its members meet certain economic conditions, create a monetary union with a single currency for some or all of them. Together with Germany we fought for tough criteria. We believe a monetary union would collapse, with damaging consequences, if it were imposed on economies that were too diverse.  A union will only come about by 1997 if a substantial majority of Community members agree it should. It would only include those members who were judged to have met specified conditions. And it would only come about if a majority of members were judged to have done so.  But the Treaty goes on to say that monetary union will come about automatically in 1999, for all who meet the conditions. We did not want to exclude ourselves from membership; but we could not accept such an automatic commitment. By the end of this decade the EC's membership will have changed; the economic performance of man of its members may have changed. We cannot tell who the members of such a union might be.  We therefore secured the freedom to make a proper judgement on events. We are as free to join if we wish as an other member. We would have to meet the same conditions - no more, no less. We will play our full part in the discussions of the monetary institutions Europe may create in the 1990s. But we are not obliged to join in a single currency if we do not want to.  - IN DUE COURSE, WE WILL MOVE TO THE NARROW BANDS OF THE ERM.  - WE WILL PLAY OUR FULL PART IN THE DESIGN AND DISCUSSION OF MONETARY INSTITUTIONS FOR EUROPE.  - WHEN OR IF OTHER MEMBERS OF THE EC MOVE TO A MONETARY UNION WITH A SINGLE CURRENCY, WE WILL TAKE OUR OWN UNFETTERED DECISION ON WHETHER TO JOIN. THAT DECISION WILL BE TAKEN BY THE UNITED KINGDOM PARLIAMENT.  THE ROUTE TO LOWER TAXES  Economic growth is created by people's hard work, ingenuity thrift and willingness to take risks. An enterprise economy rewards the industrious and thrifty We believe that government should not gobble up all the proceeds of growth, and that those who create prosperity should enjoy it, through lower taxes and more opportunity to build up personal wealth.  Our policy is therefore to reduce the share of national income taken by the public sector. In the mid-1970s, public spending peaked at over 49 per cent of our gross national product. In the early 1980s, it peaked at over 47 per cent. In this recession, it is peaking at only 43 per cent. We aim to reduce this steadily as the recovery gets under way  Keeping control of public spending will enable us to cut taxes while bringing the Government's Budget back towards balance in the years ahead. Excessive government borrowing can lead to inflation. Government should always be on guard against that danger. However, when demand in the economy is weak, public borrowing will tend to rise.  Because companies pay taxes according to how well they did the previous year, the deficit tends to be deepest just as we come out of recession. We must make sure that as the economy grows, borrowing slows.  By bringing tax and spending decisions together in a unified Budget from next year, we will make the choices clearer. But lower taxes and a prudent approach to borrowing do not mean public spending must fall; quite the reverse. A lightly-taxed economy generates more economic growth, and more revenue. High taxes kill the goose that lays the golden eggs. In the course of its last five years in office, Labour was forced to cut public spending, in real terms. By contrast, the Conservatives have been able to raise public spending by nearly a quarter in real terms.  Higher tax rates do not always bring in more money In practice, they can bring in less. The Conservative Government has more than halved the top rate of tax. Yet top rate taxpayers today provide a bigger share of our tax revenues than they did before. Lower taxes have encouraged more people to work harder - not to spend their time working out how to avoid penal taxes.  During the past 13 years we have cut, simplified or abolished a whole range of direct taxes.  - We have cut the basic rate of Income Tax from 33p to 25p, and the top rate from 83p to 40p.  - We have now announced a new starting Income Tax rate of 20p.  - We have raised the basic single person's tax allowance by 27 per cent more than would be needed to keep pace with inflation.  - We have simplified and reduced the burden of taxation on capital.  - We have cut Corporation Tax from 52 per cent to 33 per cent (and from 42 per cent to 25 per cent for small companies).  - We have reduced the burden of National Insurance on low earners.  - We have introduced independent taxation of husbands and wives, giving married women full eligibility for tax allowances.  - We have introduced new tax incentives for savings.  - We have abolished several taxes completely including the surcharge on income from savings, the National Insurance Surcharge, Development Land Tax, and Capital Transfer Tax.  We are the only party that understands the need for low taxation. Labour and the Liberals openly advocate increased taxation. Yet lower taxes clearly create a more productive economy They also achieve another prime objective of Conservative Governments, which is to transfer power from the state to the people.  Labour would:  - Reverse our cut in the starting rate of Income Tax to 20p.  - Raise the top rate.  - Abolish the National Insurance ceiling.  - Introduce a new savings surcharge.  - WE ANNOUNCED IN THE BUDGET AN IMPORTANT FIRST STEP TOWARDS A BASIC INCOME TAX RATE OF 20P. BY APPLYING A 20P RATE TO THE FIRST £2,000 OF TAXABLE INCOME, WE HAVE CUT TAXES FOR ALL 25 MILLION TAXPAYERS, AND TAKEN THE FOUR MILLION ON LOWEST INCOMES OUT OF 25P TAX ALTOGETHER.  - WE WILL MAKE FURTHER PROGRESS TOWARDS A BASIC INCOME TAX RATE OF 20P.  - WE WILL REDUCE THE SHARE OF NATIONAL INCOME TAKEN BY THE PUBLIC SECTOR. WE WILL SEE THE BUDGET RETURN TOWARDS BALANCE AS THE ECONOMY RECOVERS.  THE RIGHT TO OWN  Since 1979, wealth has been spread more widely through the community Home ownership, share ownership and the build-up of personal pensions have all contributed. Over two-thirds of people live in homes that they own, 10 million people own shares, 6 million of them in newly-privatised industries. About 2.5 million have benefited from tax incentives to encourage employee share schemes. And over 4½ million people are now building up their own personal pensions.  But these freedoms are at risk.  Labour would:  - Halt the privatisation programme and threaten the value of shares in privatised industries with renationalisation and new Government controls.  - Bring back credit rationing, leading to mortgage queues.  - Turn the pensions market on its head, making pension provision costly and difficult.  These changes would drive savings overseas and make wealth again the prerogative of the few.  By contrast, we want to do more to encourage the wider distribution of wealth throughout society Sustaining not just a home-owning but a capital owning democracy is crucial to our vision for the 1990s. We intend to spread the ownership of shares, homes, pensions and savings. We will do so through future privatisations, help for would-be home owners in council tenancies and further encouragement for the spread of personal pensions. We intend to lighten the burden of capital taxes and reform the taxation of savings.  We believe Inheritance Tax is particularly inequitable. It falls only on those who do not dispose of their assets seven years or more before their death. It is inevitably the case that these tend to be people who are not rich enough to engage in high-powered tax planning, or who, for lack of knowledge or advice, fail to take the necessary precautionary action. In the Budget, we announced that we would take most family businesses out of Inheritance Tax altogether. During the new Parliament, we will aim to lessen the burden on families to whom home ownership has brought the threat of this erratic tax.  - AS DETAILED LATER IN THIS MANIFESTO, WE WILL AIM TO BRING HOME OWNERSHIP, SHARE OWNERSHIP AND PERSONAL PENSIONS WITHIN THE REACH OF MORE FAMILIES.  - WE WILL CONTINUE TO REFORM THE TAXATION OF SAVINGS, BUILDING ON THE SUCCESS OF PEPS AND TESSAS.  - WE WILL RAISE THE TAX THRESHOLD FOR INHERITANCE TAX SO THAT THE HOMES AND SAVINGS OF AN INCREASING NUMBER OF OUR CITIZENS CAN PASS UNENCUMBERED FROM ONE GENERATION TO ANOTHER.  - WHENEVER POSSIBLE, WE WILL ENSURE THAT FUTURE PRIVATISATIONS OFFER OPPORTUNITIES TO EMPLOYEES TO SECURE A STAKE IN THE OWNERSHIP OF THEIR BUSINESS.  - WE WILL ENCOURAGE COMPANIES TO MAKE DEALING IN THEIR OWN SHARES EASIER, ESPECIALLY FOR SMALL SHAREHOLDERS, AND ENCOURAGE WIDER SHARE OWNERSHIP, THROUGH, FOR EXAMPLE, THE ESTABLISHMENT OF 'SHARE SHOPS'.  - WE WILL ABOLISH STAMP DUTY ON SHARE TRANSACTIONS.  SETTING THE ECONOMY FREE  Starting with the abolition of exchange controls in 1979, the Government has created new incentives for every part of our economy.  Manufacturing industry suffered particularly badly from the harm inflicted on the British economy by Labour Governments in the 1960s and 1970s. To a far greater extent than service industries, it was the victim of militant trades unionism, restrictive practices, nationalisation, state intervention, tax distortion, planning controls and over-regulation.  We believe strongly that a vigorous manufacturing sector is essential to a healthy British economy Over the past 13 years, we have steadily dismantled barriers to its growth.  The competitiveness and performance of British manufacturing have been transformed. Its impressive recovery was recognised by the Confederation of British Industry, in its report aptly titled Competing with the World's Best'. Manufacturing productivity has risen by more than half since 1979 - faster than in any other major industrial country. Over the past 10 years, British manufactured exports have grown faster than those of France, Germany the United States or even Japan.  The British motor industry has achieved an astonishing revival. By 1996, Britain should again be exporting more cars than we import - for the first time since 1974. We have given the industry yet more encouragement in the Budget, by halving the special tax paid on new cars.  The British Standard for Quality management has effectively become the international standard. But that is only the beginning. We have set up a team of senior business people to pursue the idea of a new British Quality Award.  The City is Europe's greatest financial centre. It contributes £11,000 million net to our balance of payments. Financial services employ 12 per cent of our workforce. London's capital markets and financial services have grown vigorously because they are innovative and highly competitive. We will continue our efforts to break down the barriers that prevent them from competing freely throughout Europe and in the wider world.  The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development is now based in London. It puts us in the forefront of encouraging investment in the developing markets of Central and Eastern Europe.  Service industries make a vital contribution to our economy and to our balance of payments. Tourism, for example, today employs 1.5 million people, 20% more than in 1980. It is an industry which boasts many famous companies - but it is also driven by the dynamism of many small firms. We will continue to help them by simplifying rules and regulations on business and through the DTI Enterprise Initiative and a range of other schemes.  - WE WILL CONTINUE TO REDUCE TAX BURDENS ON BUSINESS, AS WE HAVE DONE THIS YEAR FOR THE MOTOR INDUSTRY, WHENEVER IT IS POSSIBLE TO DO SO.  - WE WILL ABOLISH UNNECESSARY LICENCES AND REDUCE THE NEED FOR SPECIFIC APPROVALS FOR PRODUCT DESIGN.  - WE WILL BACK BRITISH COMPANIES ENCOUNTERING ANY DISCRIMINATION, TRADE BARRIERS OR STATE SUBSIDIES THAT SHOULD NO LONGER EXIST WITHIN THE SINGLE MARKET.  - WE WILL BACK THE REGULATORS OF THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY IN THEIR EFFORTS TO ACHIEVE HIGH STANDARDS WHILE KEEPING THE RULE BOOKS DOWN TO MANAGEABLE SIZE.  PRIVATISATION  Competition and private ownership are the most powerful engines of economic efficiency, innovation and choice. They lead to the creation of world-class companies.  We have returned to private enterprise two-thirds of the companies once owned by the state: 46 businesses employing about 900,000 people. This programme has been the model for governments across the whole world.  The work of liberalising markets which were once monopolised goes on. In 1984 we privatised British Telecom but only Mercury was given a licence to carry services over fixed links. In 1991 we decided to end this duopoly The UK now has one of the most open and dynamic telecommunications markets in the world.  But much greater economic efficiency is not the only gain. Employees have been able to take a direct stake in the newly privatised companies. Millions of people have been given the same chance to own a real share in the nation's assets. Companies which looked inwards to Whitehall are now listening to their customers and shareholders.  Some activities of government must always be provided in the public sector. But in central government, Next Steps Agencies and local government, management is increasingly buying-in services from the private sector. Our proposals for developing this policy have been set out in the White Papers on 'Competing for Quality' in central and local government.  - WE WILL CONTINUE OUR PRIVATISATION PROGRAMME. BRITISH COAL WILL BE RETURNED TO THE PRIVATE SECTOR. SO WILL LOCAL AUTHORITY BUS COMPANIES. WE WILL ENCOURAGE LOCAL AUTHORITIES TO SELL THEIR AIRPORTS. WE WILL END BRITISH RAIL'S MONOPOLY. WE WILL SELL CERTAIN RAIL SERVICES AND FRANCHISE OTHERS. THESE PROPOSALS ARE SET OUT LATER IN THIS MANIFESTO.  - THE PORTS ACT 1991 HAS PAVED THE WAY FOR THE PRIVATISATION OF THE TRUST PORTS BY COMPETITIVE TENDER. TEES AND HARTLEPOOL, TILBURY, MEDWAY, FORTH AND CLYDE HAVE ALREADY BEEN PRIVATISED.  - WE ARE PRIVATISING NORTHERN IRELAND ELECTRICITY AND WILL PRIVATISE THE NORTHERN IRELAND WATER AND SEWAGE SERVICES. WE WILL LOOK FOR WAYS OF BRINGING PRIVATE SECTOR SKILLS INTO THE MANAGEMENT OF NORTHERN IRELAND RAILWAYS.  - WE WILL BRING PRIVATE SECTOR ENTERPRISE INTO THE PUBLIC SERVICES BY ENCOURAGING CONTRACTING OUT AND COMPETITIVE TENDERING THROUGHOUT GOVERNMENT.  - WE WILL REQUIRE ALL GOVERNMENT DEPARTMENTS TO REPORT ANNUALLY ON THEIR PLANS FOR MARKET-TESTING, AND PROGRESS IN ACHIEVING IT, IN THEIR OWN SERVICES AND IN THOSE OF THEIR ASSOCIATED AGENCIES.  - WE WILL MAINTAIN OUR PROGRAMME OF COMPULSORY COMPETITIVE TENDERING OF LOCAL AUTHORITY SERVICES. WE WILL ENSURE THAT UNFAIR TERMS ARE EXCLUDED AND WILL DISCOURAGE INVESTMENT TO PROTECT IN- HOUSE SERVICES WHEN BETTER, MORE COST EFFECTIVE SERVICES ARE AVAILABLE THROUGH THE PRIVATE SECTOR.  - WE WILL ENSURE THAT COMPETITIVE TENDERING IS EXTENDED TO WHITE COLLAR LOCAL AUTHORITY SERVICES, SUCH AS THOSE OFFERED BY LAWYERS, ACCOUNTANTS, ARCHITECTS AND SURVEYORS.  - WE WILL TACKLE ALL ANTI-COMPETITIVE AND RESTRICTIVE PRACTICES WITH VIGOUR. WE WILL INTRODUCE NEW LEGISLATION GIVING STRONGER POWERS TO DEAL WITH CARTELS.  DEREGULATION  We are concerned that at every level of government - in Europe, in Whitehall and in local authorities - some regulations may have been adopted in answer to legitimate concerns, but without proper regard to their overall impact on businesses and individuals. A proper balance needs to be struck between essential protection for the public, and over-zealous and intrusive controls aimed at the elimination of all conceivable risk. It is wrong that new regulations, designed to deal with isolated problems, should interfere with the private arrangements of citizens or with reasonable commercial practices that have earned broad public acceptance.  - THE COMPLIANCE COSTS OF NEW UK AND EC REGULATIONS MUST BE ASSESSED PROPERLY. EXISTING REGULATIONS WHICH ARE OUTMODED AND BURDENSOME MUST BE SIMPLIFIED OR REMOVED. WE WILL GIVE PRIORITY TO THE WORK OF THE DTI DEREGULATION UNIT IN THESE AREAS.  - WE WILL EXAMINE WAYS IN WHICH THE UNIFORM SCOPE OF REGULATION COULD BE EASED TO SAFEGUARD TRADITIONAL LOCAL PRODUCTS OR PRACTICES.  - WE WILL EXAMINE WHETHER CERTAIN REGULATIONS AFFECTING INDIVIDUAL CITIZENS WITHIN THEIR OWN HOMES COULD BE MADE ADVISORY, RATHER THAN MANDATORY.  ENERGY  Our energy policies have brought the consumer both lower prices and better service. We have privatised British Gas and the electricity industry in a way that has opened these markets to competition. These policies are now being seized upon in Europe as essential extensions of the Single Market.  Domestic customers are now protected by a price formula, and high standards of service are enforced by the independent regulators. For instance, electricity disconnections for debt have fallen by 43 per cent since the launch of privatisation.  We have ensured that the safety of employees comes first, and have given thousands the opportunity of acquiring a stake in their industry.  The future of the coal industry depends crucially on the competitiveness of coal as a fuel for electricity generation. British Coal has made enormous progress in increasing productivity since the end of the 1985 strike - but there is still further to go. We will support the efforts of British Coal and its workforce to improve the industry's performance. The long term future of the industry lies in the private sector.  We have invested in clean coal technology to safeguard the environment. Renewable energy projects have received unprecedented support. North Sea oil and gas are enjoying a record expansion thanks to our policies of deregulation and low taxation.  - SAFETY WILL REMAIN OUR HIGHEST PRIORITY THROUGHOUT THE ENERGY SECTOR.  - WE WILL CONTINUE TO ENCOURAGE COMPETITION IN ENERGY MARKETS. WE WILL PROGRESSIVELY REDUCE BRITISH GAS' MONOPOLY OF THE RETAIL GAS MARKET, TO GIVE SMALL USERS THE SAME RIGHTS AS BIG FIRMS.  - WE WILL PRIVATISE BRITISH COAL IN A WAY THAT ENABLES EMPLOYEES TO ENJOY A STAKE IN THE INDUSTRY.  - WE WILL INCREASE OUR SUPPORT FOR BRITISH COAL ENTERPRISE WHICH PROMOTES ECONOMIC REGENERATION IN AREAS AFFECTED BY THE CLOSURE OF MINES, AND HAS SUCCESSFULLY ASSISTED 76,000 PEOPLE IN FINDING NEW JOBS.  - WE WILL REVIEW THE FUTURE OF THE NUCLEAR INDUSTRY IN 1994. WE ARE COMMITTED TO SAFE AND ECONOMICAL NUCLEAR POWER. THE EXISTING STRICT ARRANGEMENTS FOR NUCLEAR WASTE WILL BE MAINTAINED.  - WE WILL MAINTAIN A GUARANTEED MARKET FOR RENEWABLE ENERGY PROJECTS AND FLUID RESEARCH IN THIS AREA.  - WE WILL CONSULT ON NEW BUILDING REGULATIONS TO IMPROVE ENERGY USE. TOGETHER WITH BRITISH GAS AND SOME OF THE REGIONAL ELECTRICITY COMPANIES, WE WILL ESTABLISH AN INDEPENDENT ENERGY SAVINGS TRUST TO PROMOTE ENERGY EFFICIENCY. OUR GRANTS SCHEME FOR LOW INCOME HOUSEHOLDS WILL RECEIVE RECORD FUNDING NEXT YEAR.  SCIENCE AND INNOVATION  British science has an unrivalled reputation for ground-breaking research. We believe in investing in scientific research because it enriches the quality of our lives and provides the feedstock of industrial innovation. The science budget has grown by 24 per cent in real terms since 1978-9. Increasingly funding will reflect the quality of the research output so that the best centres can truly be world leaders.  The Government spends nearly £3,000 million a year on civil research and development - at least as high a proportion of national income as the Japanese or Americans. And since 1978, British industry's spending on R&D has increased by 37 per cent in real terms.  - WE WILL CONTINUE TO SUPPORT OUR SCIENCE BASE TO MAINTAIN THE EXCELLENCE OF OUR SCIENCE AND TO ENSURE THAT WE PRODUCE THE SKILLED TECHNICAL PEOPLE WE NEED.  - WE WILL ENCOURAGE THE TRANSFER OF PEOPLE AND TECHNOLOGY FROM UNIVERSITIES TO BUSINESSES AND UPGRADE THE LINK SCHEME, WHICH FUNDS JOINT RESEARCH.  - WE WILL ENCOURAGE THE ESTABLISHMENT OF CENTRES OF TECHNOLOGICAL EXCELLENCE LINKING INDUSTRIAL RESEARCH ORGANISATIONS WITH UNIVERSITIES AND POLYTECHNICS.  - WE WILL CONTINUE TO DEVELOP NEW INNOVATION SCHEMES FOR SMALL AND MEDIUM-SIZED BUSINESSES, INCLUDING THE HIGHLY-REGARDED SPUR PROGRAMME TO PROVIDE HELP WITH THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW PRODUCTS AND PROCESSES.  REGIONAL POLICIES  In recent years, the United Kingdom has attracted five times as much Japanese investment as Germany or France, which powerfully demonstrates that we have created the most attractive environment in Europe for investors. Our positive policy towards inward investment will be maintained, in contrast to that of the TUC and the Labour Party.  The Government will continue to invest in a strong infrastructure, and boost technology expertise in the regions.  - WE WILL ENSURE THAT REGIONAL POLICY IS WELL TARGETED.  - WE WILL CONTINUE TO SUPPORT ALL PARTS OF THE UNITED KINGDOM IN THEIR CAMPAIGNS TO ATTRACT INWARD INVESTMENT.  - WE WILL GIVE ADDITIONAL EMPHASIS TO UPGRADING SKILLS AND TECHNOLOGY WHEN ALLOCATING FUNDS.  SMALL BUSINESSES  Small businesses are the seedcorn of the economy Their numbers have grown by more than a third since 1979, while the number of self-employed people has grown to over 12 per cent of the workforce. We will continue to recognise the special needs of small and medium-sized companies, and to ensure that Government delivers useful services to them.  Our tax regime for small businesses is one of the most favourable in Europe. We have raised the VAT threshold every year since 1979 and reduced the small companies rate of Corporation Tax from 42 per cent to 25 per cent.  Training and Enterprise Councils (and Local Enterprise Companies in Scotland) have developed a wide range of services for business and enterprise which assist over 150,000 small companies each year. We have developed the popular Enterprise Initiative, under which 40,000 companies have been helped to buy in outside expertise offering key management skills. We now propose to develop this initiative further.  We also propose to help businesses by easing the transfer of commercial tenancies.  - WE ANNOUNCED IN THE BUDGET NEW MEASURES TO HELP SMALL BUSINESSES, INCLUDING FULL RELIEF AGAINST INHERITANCE TAX ON MOST BUSINESS ASSETS, REDUCTIONS IN BUSINESS RATES AND PROPOSALS TO SPEED UP THE PAYMENT OF OUTSTANDING BILLS.  - DURING THE NEW PARLIAMENT, WE WILL DEVELOP A NEW ENTERPRISE SERVICE TO GIVE SMALL AND MEDIUM-SIZED COMPANIES HELP IN DIAGNOSING THEIR MOST IMPORTANT STRATEGIC NEEDS. A NEW CONSULTANCY BROKERAGE SERVICE WILL SUPPLY INFORMATION TO SMALL COMPANIES. WE WILL ALSO DEVELOP A TECHNOLOGY AUDIT WHICH WILL PROVIDE SMALL FIRMS WITH A PLAN FOR CHANGE. AND WE WILL CONTINUE TO SUPPORT TOTAL QUALITY MANAGEMENT CONSULTANCIES.  - TECS AND LECS WILL BE CLOSELY INVOLVED IN DEVELOPING AND IMPLEMENTING THIS NEW INITIATIVE.  The independent Law Commission has recommended that a commercial tenant should in general be freed from any future liability under a lease when he assigns away his interest under it. We will consider how this principle could be put into effect for new commercial leases.  CONSUMER AFFAIRS  Consumers want choice, quality and value for money Competition only works effectively if consumers have the information they need to make sensible decisions.  Our food safety policy promotes consumer choice and consumer safety We introduced the 1990 Food Safety Act to ensure the highest standards of food hygiene.  - WE WILL INTRODUCE LEGISLATION DESIGNED TO GIVE CONSUMERS CONFIDENCE THAT WHAT THEY PURCHASE IS PROPERLY DESCRIBED - AND THAT ADEQUATE COMPENSATION IS OFFERED WHERE THESE REQUIREMENTS ARE NOT MET.  - WE WILL ENABLE THE COURTS TO OVERRIDE UNFAIR TERMS IN CONTRACTS AND IMPROVE OUR POWERS TO DEAL WITH ROGUE TRADERS.  - WE WILL ENSURE THAT GUARANTEES MEAN WHAT THEY SAY, AND THAT MANUFACTURERS OR IMPORTERS SHARE RESPONSIBILITY WITH THE PEOPLE WHO SELL THEIR GOODS.  - WE WILL TIGHTEN UP THE RULES ON HOLIDAY BROCHURES AND CONTRACTS, AND INTRODUCE A 'COOLING-OFF' PERIOD INTO TIMESHARE CONTRACTS.  - WE WILL INTRODUCE LEGISLATION TO SIMPLIFY TRADE MARK REGISTRATION AND EXTEND THE RIGHTS THEY CONFER.  - WE WILL ENFORCE SCIENCE-BASED CONTROLS ON THE USE OF CHEMICALS IN FOOD PRODUCTION, AND WILL MAINTAIN OUR POLICY OF OPEN ACCESS TO INFORMATION ON PESTICIDE SAFETY.  - WE WILL IMPROVE STANDARDS OF FOOD LABELLING IN CLOSE CONSULTATION WITH CONSUMER REPRESENTATIVES.  CHOICE AND THE CHARTER  The Citizen's Charter is the most far-reaching programme ever devised to improve quality in public services. It addresses the needs of those who use public services, extends people's rights, requires services to set clear standards - and to tell the public how far those standards are met.  The Citizen's Charter:  - widens popular choice;  - helps people to exercise that choice in a properly informed way;  - expects all public services to put the customer first;  - promotes the challenge of competition within the public sector;  - requires clear performance standards to be set and for services to be measured against them;  - insists on a proper response to complaints and on action to set right the problems behind them.  The Charter will be at the centre of government's decision-making throughout the 1990s. No one doubts the professionalism of the vast majority of public servants. But too often the system's outdated working methods and attitudes prevent them from giving their best. The Charter's commitment to modern, open services will help them to win the respect that good service deserves.  In less than a year since the White Paper, 18 detailed Charters have been published. Each sets out tough new standards and gives new information and rights to the public. Each will be revised regularly to check on progress, and raise standards higher. But, already results are clear.  - In hospitals, from April, every out-patient will have a fixed appointment time and our guarantee of maximum waiting times for operations will be steadily improved.  - On council estates every tenant will have the right to call in a private contractor if the council fails to do a minor repair.  - In schools, all parents will have the right to a report on their child's performance and details on that of the school.  Rights such as these should not have been denied to the public. The Citizen's Charter, steadily but surely, is changing all that.  KNOWLEDGE, STANDARDS, CHOICE  The next Conservative Government will carry the Charter still further. There will be more information about standards and performance; clear standards set within public services which are still shrouded in mystery; more choice built into public services and proper complaints procedures introduced. Many of these are outlined later in the Manifesto under Education, Health, Local Government and Transport. Here are a few examples from the programme for the next two years:  - THE AUDIT COMMISSION WILL BE ABLE TO PUBLISH LEAGUE TABLES OF PERFORMANCE INCLUDING EACH LOCAL COUNCIL AND HEALTH AUTHORITY SO THAT PEOPLE CAN COMPARE THE QUALITY OF SERVICE.  - WE WILL ENSURE THAT INSPECTION REPORTS ARE PUBLISHED AND WIDELY AVAILABLE. ALL COUNCILS WILL HAVE TO RESPOND IN PUBLIC TO CRITICISM FROM AUDITORS.  - WE WILL INTRODUCE A NEW 'CHARTERLINE' THAT PEOPLE WITH QUESTIONS OR PROBLEMS WITH A PUBLIC SERVICE WILL BE ABLE TO RING.  - WE WILL REQUIRE BRITISH RAIL TO TIGHTEN ITS TARGETS FOR RELIABILITY AND PUNCTUALITY ON ALL LINES, AND REPORT MONTHLY TO PASSENGERS ON HOW IT IS DOING. LONDON UNDERGROUND WILL PUBLISH ITS OWN CHARTER.  - WE WILL EXPECT POST OFFICES AND JOB CENTRES TO SET OUT STANDARDS OF SERVICE AND LEVELS OF ACHIEVEMENT.  - A NEW CHARTER MARK AWARD WILL GIVE RECOGNITION TO THOSE PARTS OF THE PUBLIC SERVICE THAT BEST MEET CHARTER STANDARDS.  - BRITISH RAIL AND LONDON UNDERGROUND ARE INTRODUCING COMPENSATION SYSTEMS FOR TRAVELLERS.  - WE WILL REVIEW THE POWERS OF THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT OMBUDSMAN TO ENSURE THAT FINDINGS OF MALADMINISTRATION ARE PROPERLY DEALT WITH BY ALL LOCAL AUTHORITIES. WE WILL CONSULT ON A NEW LAY ADJUDICATORS SCHEME TO HELP THE PUBLIC RESOLVE DIFFICULTIES AND DISPUTES.  We will extend competition and accountability in public services. Those who provide public services will have to prove they can give the right quality at the right cost.  - WE WILL EXTEND COMPULSORY COMPETITIVE TENDERING TO LOCAL AUTHORITY HOUSING MANAGEMENT, AND EXAMINE HOW TO APPLY IT TO WHITE-COLLAR SERVICES. WE WILL ACT TO ENSURE THAT PRIVATE FIRMS BIDDING TO IMPROVE LOCAL AUTHORITY PUBLIC SERVICES ARE NOT OBSTRUCTED BY UNSCRUPULOUS PRACTICES IN COUNCILS OR BY UNFAIR CONTRACTS. WE WILL PURSUE MORE COMPETITIVE TENDERING FOR CENTRAL GOVERNMENT SERVICES.  - WE WILL ENCOURAGE THE WIDER USE OF PERFORMANCE PAY INSIDE THE CIVIL SERVICE AND IN OTHER PARTS OF THE PUBLIC SERVICE. A LINK BETWEEN A PERSON'S EFFORT AND HIS OR HER PAY IS A POWERFUL MEANS OF IMPROVING PERFORMANCE.  - CIVIL SERVANTS DEALING WITH THE PUBLIC WILL NORMALLY IDENTIFY THEMSELVES BY NAME.  - WE WILL TOUGHEN INSPECTION OF KEY PUBLIC SERVICES WHERE CHOICE AND COMPETITION MUST INEVITABLY BE LIMITED. WE WILL INTRODUCE, FOR THE FIRST TIME, REGULAR INDEPENDENT INSPECTION OF ALL SCHOOLS.  - WE WILL ACT TO ENSURE THAT THE INSPECTORATES OF POLICE, FIRE, PROBATION, AND SOCIAL SERVICES, TOGETHER WITH ANY NEW INSPECTORATES THAT ARE ESTABLISHED, WILL BE TRULY INDEPENDENT OF THE SERVICE WHICH THEY INSPECT.  - WE WILL ENSURE THAT THE REPORTS FROM THESE SYSTEMATIC REGULAR INSPECTIONS ARE PUBLISHED. MORE LAY INSPECTORS, DRAWN FROM OTHER PROFESSIONS AND FROM THE GENERAL PUBLIC, WILL BRING FRESH INSIGHTS INTO SERVICE IMPROVEMENT.  - WE WILL PUBLISH LATER THIS YEAR NEW PROPOSALS FOR THE INSPECTION OF SOCIAL WORK IN ENGLAND, SETTING UP ARRANGEMENTS FOR SYSTEMATIC INDEPENDENT INSPECTION OF ALL CARE SERVICES AND EVERY LOCAL AUTHORITY SOCIAL SERVICES DEPARTMENT.  - INSPECTIONS OF LOCAL AUTHORITY HOMES WILL BE CARRIED OUT BY TEAMS THAT CONTAIN LAY INSPECTORS AND ARE INDEPENDENT OF THE INFLUENCE OF THE MANAGEMENT OF THE HOMES.  All of the privatised utilities have a specialist regulator who is responsible for promoting competition, reviewing prices and protecting the public interest. We have introduced legislation to increase the powers of these regulators to the level of the strongest.  - WE ARE ENSURING THAT THE REGULATORS HAVE THE POWERS THEY NEED TO PROMOTE COMPETITION AND SAFEGUARD THE INTERESTS OF THE CUSTOMER BY CONTROLLING PRICE INCREASES. WE WILL INCREASE COMPETITION IN THE GAS AND WATER MARKETS.  - WE ARE GIVING THE REGULATORS POWERS TO SET STANDARDS OF SERVICE, COVERING SUCH MATTERS AS FIXED APPOINTMENT TIMES FOR SERVICE CALLS.  THE POST OFFICE  The Post Office is among the best in Europe for speed and reliability of its letter services. Traffic has grown by 50 per cent in a decade in which it has operated without a subsidy Last year the first-class letter service achieved record improvements in reliability The local post office is a vital and valued feature of the rural community.  In 1981 we introduced private competition for deliveries costing over £1. This led to the rapid growth of the private courier industry with substantial benefits to business users. We believe that further benefits to consumers would flow from additional competition.  - WE ARE COMMITTED TO MAINTAINING A NATION WIDE LETTER SERVICE WITH DELIVERY TO EVERY ADDRESS IN THE UNITED KINGDOM, WITHIN A UNIFORM STRUCTURE OF PRICES, AND WITH A NATION-WIDE NETWORK OF POST OFFICES.  - WE WILL LEGISLATE TO SET UP A NEW INDEPENDENT REGULATOR TO ADVISE ON ISSUES AFFECTING POST OFFICE CUSTOMERS, AND ON THE PROGRESSIVE INTRODUCTION OF COMPETITION.  - WE WILL SET PERFORMANCE TARGETS FOR THE POST OFFICE AND ENSURE THEY ARE PUBLISHED IN ALL OFFICES, TOGETHER WITH RESULTS ACHIEVED.  - WE WILL ENSURE THERE IS EFFECTIVE REDRESS FOR CUSTOMERS WHERE SERVICES FAIL.  - WE WILL LOWER THE LIMIT ON THE POST OFFICE MONOPOLY MUCH CLOSER TO THE LEVEL OF THE FIRST CLASS STAMP.  - WE WILL PROVIDE IMPROVED SCOPE FOR CONTRACTORS TO CARRY MAIL TO FINAL DELIVERY OFFICES.  - WE WILL CONSIDER REQUESTS TO LICENSE LIMITED SPECIALIST SERVICES TO COMPETE WITHIN THE POST OFFICE MONOPOLY.  WHITEHALL & WESTMINSTER  Whitehall must move with the times. It is over a decade since the last major restructuring of the departments of government. Since then:  - Two-thirds of the state industrial sector has been privatised, transferring about 900,000 jobs to the private sector.  - Government has reduced the burden of regulation and the need for central bureaucracy  - Civil Service manpower has been reduced by almost a quarter.  - Many of the functions of government have been devolved from Whitehall.  - The Citizen's Charter programme is bringing new quality to public services.  We will continue to reorganise central government in tune with its modern role, while devolving and contracting-out executive functions. We want to ensure that the drive to save money to reduce bureaucracy and raise quality is powerfully led from the centre of government.  - WE WILL GIVE A CABINET MINISTER RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE CITIZEN'S CHARTER PROGRAMME AND REFORMING THE CIVIL SERVICE, TAKING CHARGE OF THE CITIZEN'S CHARTER UNIT, EFFICIENCY UNIT, THE PROGRAMME FOR CREATING AGENCIES AND THE PUBLIC COMPETITION AND PURCHASING UNIT. THIS WILL MAKE IT EASIER TO RAISE QUALITY AND EFFICIENCY IN GOVERNMENT AND SEE THAT CONTRACTING-OUT AND MARKET-TESTING ARE ENERGETICALLY PURSUED.  - WE INTEND TO CREATE A NEW DEPARTMENT, UNDER A CABINET MINISTER, WITH RESPONSIBILITY FOR BROADCASTING, ARTS, SPORT, TOURISM, THE NATIONAL HERITAGE AND THE FILM INDUSTRY. THIS DEPARTMENT WILL AIM TO ENCOURAGE PRIVATE SECTOR ENTERPRISE IN ALL THESE FIELDS. THE NATIONAL LOTTERY AND THE MILLENNIUM FUND (DETAILED LATER IN THIS MANIFESTO) WILL ALSO BRING NEW RESPONSIBILITIES TO GOVERNMENT IN THESE AREAS.  - WE WILL TRANSFER THE CORE RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY TO THE DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND INDUSTRY AND RESPONSIBILITIES FOR ENERGY EFFICIENCY TO THE DEPARTMENT OF THE ENVIRONMENT, ENDING THE NEED FOR A SEPARATE DEPARTMENT  - SMALL BUSINESSES ARE THE SEEDCORN OF OUR FUTURE PROSPERITY WE BELIEVE THE DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND INDUSTRY SHOULD TAKE OVER RESPONSIBILITY FOR THEM. WE ALSO WANT TO STRENGTHEN THE LINKS BETWEEN THE DTI AND THE HIGHLY SUCCESSFUL TRAINING AND ENTERPRISE COUNCILS.  - RESPONSIBILITY FOR OVERSEEING ALL FINANCIAL SERVICES WILL BE BROUGHT TOGETHER IN THE TREASURY, IN LINE WITH THE PRACTICE ADOPTED IN MOST OTHER ADVANCED COUNTRIES.  - NEW PROGRAMMES FOR REGENERATING OUR INNER CITIES ARE OUTLINED IN THIS MANIFESTO. RESPONSIBILITIES WILL BE BROUGHT TOGETHER IN THE DEPARTMENT OF THE ENVIRONMENT.  - WE ARE DETERMINED TO ENSURE THAT WOMEN IN THE WORK-FORCE REALISE THEIR FULL POTENTIAL. WE WILL TRANSFER FROM THE HOME OFFICE TO THE DEPARTMENT OF EMPLOYMENT THE LEAD RESPONSIBILITY FOR CO-ORDINATING GOVERNMENT POLICY ON ISSUES OF PARTICULAR CONCERN TO WOMEN.  OPEN GOVERNMENT  Government has traditionally been far too reluctant to provide information. This secrecy extends from the processes of Cabinet Government to schools which refuse to release exam results. Under the Citizen's Charter, a great deal more information is now being made available on the services provided by government.  We have also:  - replaced the catch-all provisions of the 1911 Official Secrets Act with narrower offences depending on specific tests of the harm likely to be caused by disclosure, while giving special protection to vital information relating to our national security;  - introduced rights to check certain personal records held on computer, and supported new rights of access to a range of government records;  - committed ourselves to a public right of access to information about the environment, including water supply, air quality dumping at sea and radioactive substances;  - made available more reports on matters of public concern such as food safety and industrial risks.  We intend to carry forward this move towards greater openness.  - WE WILL REVIEW THE 80 OR SO STATUTORY RESTRICTIONS WHICH EXIST ON THE DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION - RETAINING ONLY THOSE NEEDED TO PROTECT PRIVACY AND ESSENTIAL CONFIDENTIALITY.  - WE WILL SEEK TO PROVIDE GREATER ACCESS TO PERSONAL RECORDS HELD BY GOVERNMENT.  - WE WILL BE LESS SECRETIVE ABOUT THE WORKINGS OF GOVERNMENT. FOR EXAMPLE, WHEN THE COMMITTEES OF THE CABINET ARE RECONSTITUTED AFTER THE ELECTION WE WILL, FOR THE FIRST TIME, SET OUT THEIR NAMES AND MEMBERSHIP. WE WILL UPDATE AND - FOR THE FIRST TIME - PUBLISH THE GUIDANCE FOR MINISTERS ON PROCEDURE.  THE WORKINGS OF PARLIAMENT  It is not just Whitehall that must change. Parliament, too, has to keep its working methods under review to make sure it attracts the best people to the service of their country and uses their talents to best effect.  - WE WILL PROPOSE APPROPRIATE PARLIAMENTARY REFORMS TO ENSURE THAT THE HOUSE OF COMMONS CONDUCTS ITS BUSINESS MORE EFFICIENTLY AND EFFECTIVELY, TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THE BENEFITS OF MODERN TECHNOLOGY, THE INCREASING CONSTITUENCY DEMANDS UPON MEMBERS OF PARLIAMENT AND THE NEED TO ATTRACT MORE WOMEN TO STAND FOR ELECTION.  OPPORTUNITY FOR ALL  Conservatives believe that high standards in education and training are the key to personal opportunity and national success. We believe in partnership with parents, choice in schools and a good grounding in the basic skills all children need to make a success of their lives. We are committed to widening opportunities without compromising academic standards. We will continue to expand higher education and training. We will reinforce the rights of the individual in the world of work, and break down artificial barriers to advancement. By extending opportunity and arming people with the power to choose, we will give valuable freedoms and a powerful spur to achievement.  SCHOOLS, PUPILS & PARENTS  We are now seeing real improvements in our education system. One in four young people goes on to higher education; at the beginning of the 1980s, it was only one in eight. Sixty per cent of 16 year-olds stay on in full-time education, up from only 40 per cent in 1979. And we have embarked on the most important and wide-ranging reforms since the 1940s.  For the first time in our history, we will soon have a National Curriculum which will require all the main school subjects to be covered thoroughly The testing of 7 year-olds is well under way and tests for older children are now being developed. Starting this September, GCSE courses will be steadily integrated with the National Curriculum.  Under the Parent's Charter, all schools will have to provide at least one written report on the progress of each child each year. Information on the performance of all local schools will be given to parents, enabling them to exercise choice more effectively  We believe all parents have the right to choice in education - not only those who can afford school fees. Young people differ in their interests and aptitudes, and we need a range of schools to offer them the best opportunities. We have always fought to maintain diversity in education, protecting the right of local people to preserve their grammar schools, and defending independent schools against mindless Labour attacks. And we have always valued the important contribution made by the churches to our children's education.  We have further increased diversity by:  - Giving schools control over their own budgets and encouraging new types of school.  - Allowing schools to become independent of local councils, by applying for Grant-Maintained status if the parents involved so wish. By mid-1992, over 200 GM schools will be up and running.  - Creating a number of highly popular City Technology Colleges.  - Launching the highly successful initiative under which schools are able to bid directly for the resources to become Technology Schools.  We intend to take all these initiatives further and offer parents more choice in the new Parliament. Popular schools will be allowed to expand, and more schools will be able to apply for technology funding. We will make it easier for small schools to enjoy the benefits of GM status by grouping together.  - WE WILL COMPLETE THE INTRODUCTION OF THE NATIONAL CURRICULUM OFFERING 10 SUBJECTS AT A NATIONALLY-DEFINED STANDARD - ENGLISH, MATHEMATICS, SCIENCE, HISTORY, GEOGRAPHY, TECHNOLOGY, ART, MUSIC, PE AND, IN SECONDARY SCHOOLS, A FOREIGN LANGUAGE.  - REGULAR AND STRAIGHTFORWARD TESTS WILL BE IN PLACE FOR ALL 7, 11 AND 14 YEAR-OLDS BY 1994.  - GCSE AT AGE 16 WILL BE INTEGRATED INTO THE NATIONAL CURRICULUM, WITH A NEW A+ GRADE TO TEST THE MOST ABLE. THE MAJORITY OF MARKS WILL COME FROM A WRITTEN EXAM.  - WE WILL CONTINUE TO ENCOURAGE THE CREATION OF NURSERY PLACES. FOR THE FIRST TIME, OVER 50 PER CENT OF THREE AND FOUR YEAR OLDS HAVE PLACES EITHER IN NURSERY OR PRIMARY SCHOOLS.  - FULL INFORMATION WILL BE PUBLISHED ANNUALLY ABOUT THE PERFORMANCE OF ALL LOCAL SCHOOLS IN EACH AREA.  - INDEPENDENT INSPECTION OF SCHOOLS WILL PROVIDE PARENTS WITH STRAIGHTFORWARD REPORTS ON THEIR CHILD'S SCHOOL, TOGETHER WITH AN ACTION PLAN FROM GOVERNORS TO REMEDY ANY WEAKNESSES.  - POPULAR SCHOOLS WHICH ARE OVER SUBSCRIBED WILL HE GIVEN THE RESOURCES TO EXPAND.  - GM SCHOOLS WILL BE ABLE TO CHANGE THEIR CHARACTER IF THAT IS WHAT PARENTS CLEARLY WANT AND THE CHANGE FITS IN WITH THE WIDER NEEDS OF THE LOCAL AREA.  - THE TECHNOLOGY SCHOOLS INITIATIVE WILL BE EXPANDED ACROSS THE COUNTRY.  - EXISTING SCHOOLS WHICH OPT FOR GM STATUS WILL BE ABLE TO EMULATE CITY TECHNOLOGY COLLEGES AND ATTRACT PRIVATE TECHNOLOGY SPONSORSHIP.  - WE WILL MAINTAIN THE ASSISTED PLACES SCHEME, WHICH GIVES ACCESS TO INDEPENDENT EDUCATION TO MANY FAMILIES WHO COULD NOT OTHERWISE AFFORD IT.  - WE WILL ENSURE THAT THE PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN THE STATE AND THE CHURCHES IN EDUCATION IS MAINTAINED AND STRENGTHENED.  - WE WILL ENABLE SMALL SCHOOLS TO APPLY FOR GM STATUS IN GROUPS.  - WE WILL PAY PARTICULAR ATTENTION TO RAISING EDUCATIONAL STANDARDS IN AREAS OF DEPRIVATION IN OUR CITIES.  TEACHING  We are determined to reinforce the professionalism of teachers and the esteem in which they are held. We have created an independent Teachers' Pay Review Body We accepted in full its first recommendations; nearly half of all teachers are now earning over £20,000 a year. We will press ahead with regular appraisal of teachers to encourage high standards and develop professional skills.  As a first step in the reform of teacher training, postgraduate students will spend much more time in school classrooms, learning their skills under the practised eye of senior teachers.  It is vital that the education system should attract back women who have taken a career break to raise a family Through grants to local authorities, we are financing schemes to introduce more flexible working practices - such as job-sharing.  - WE WILL UNDERTAKE REFORM OF THE TEACHER TRAINING SYSTEM TO MAKE IT MORE EFFECTIVE IN DEVELOPING CLASSROOM SKILLS.  - WE WILL DEVELOP MEASURES TO ENCOURAGE WOMEN WITH FAMILY RESPONSIBILITIES TO ENTER OR RETURN TO TEACHING.  AFTER 16  We believe that young people should be free to choose between college, work-based training and sixth form studies. We are giving further education colleges and sixth form colleges in England and Wales autonomy, free from council control. We also value our school sixth forms, and will ensure they retain their place in the new system. And we will allow them to attract older students as well. FE colleges will continue to receive support for adult education, while local authorities will retain the resources to respond to local demand for leisure courses.  We will defend the well-respected A-level examinations, which Labour would destroy We will continue to encourage participation m AS examinations. We will also continue to develop new high-quality National Vocational Qualifications, and introduce a new post-16 diploma which recognises achievement in both vocational and academic courses.  - We will develop an Advanced Diploma which can be earned by students pursuing either academic or vocational courses, and a new General National Vocational Qualification.  - We intend to allow school sixth forms to open their doors if they wish to older students, and to accept training credits or fees from them.  - From April next year, further education and sixth form colleges will be independent of local government control.  - Mature students will enjoy a wider choice of courses.  HIGHER EDUCATION  Britain maintains the best university system in Europe. We have also developed a thriving network of polytechnics, whose student numbers have increased nearly sixfold since the end of the 1960s.  By the year 2000, one in three young people will follow full-time higher education courses. Meanwhile, the number of mature entrants to higher education has risen by 65 per cent since 1979. And our universities are attracting increasing numbers of foreign students.  Despite this huge expansion, our students enjoy one of the most generous support systems in the world. The introduction of student loans has given students 30 per cent more money for their living costs than the former system of grants alone. The new system will steadily reduce the proportion of students' living costs that their parents are expected to meet.  - WE WILL CONTINUE TO EXPAND THE NUMBER OF STUDENTS IN HIGHER EDUCATION. WE ARE ABOLISHING THE ARTIFICIAL 'BINARY LINE' BETWEEN UNIVERSITIES AND POLYTECHNICS.  - WE ARE PUTTING IN PLACE NEW MECHANISMS TO ENSURE THAT ACADEMIC STANDARDS ARE MAINTAINED IN HIGHER EDUCATION.  - WE WILL CONTINUE TO PROVIDE GENEROUS SUPPORT FOR STUDENTS AND TO EXPAND OUR STUDENT LOANS COMMITMENT.  THE TRAINING REVOLUTION  A training revolution is under way in Britain. The Government's job is to create a framework within which men and women of all ages can develop skills, gain qualifications and shape their own futures.  We have already brought the world of work and the world of school into closer harmony Government and industry are working together. Employers already spend over £20,000 million a year on training. Government spending on training has increased 2½ times in real terms since 1979, to £2,800 million. The Government's effort is being channelled through the 82 new Training and Enterprise Councils (and the Local Enterprise Companies in Scotland) - the most significant peace time partnership between government and industry this century.  - 'Compacts' have resulted in many young people working to goals for attainment and attendance in school. In return, they are guaranteed a job with training - or training leading to a job.  - This year, two million students will participate in the Technical and Vocational Education Initiative.  - Investors in People is the new national standard for companies making a commitment to training. TECs play an important role in helping companies attain it.  - Employer-led TECs and LECs are delivering Government-funded training programmes which reflect industry's understanding of local needs.  - Industry is working closely with the National Council for Vocational Qualifications.  - The CBI's training targets for Britain's workforce demonstrate a new partnership between business and education.  75 per cent of 16 year-olds stay on in full-time education or Youth Training schemes, up from 46 per cent in 1979. Since 1983, over 3 million young people have taken up Youth Training places. And 82 per cent go into jobs or further education when they complete YT.  Now we are offering young people aged 16 and 17 vouchers they can use to buy approved courses of education or training, and which will put the power of choice in their hands.  In 1988, we launched Employment Training, the largest programme of its kind in Europe, which has since helped 1.2 million people. While local programmes are the responsibility of the TECs, the Government guarantees the offer of help to particular groups of unemployed.  Last year, we launched the new Employment Action programme, which will help more than 61,000 people in a full year. This is a new addition to a range of measures which include Jobclubs, the Job Interview Guarantee Scheme and other tested methods of helping unemployed people back to work.  We are also supporting individual training effort. Since 1988, when we launched Career Development Loans (interest-free for up to 15 months), over 25,000 people have benefited. Last year's Budget gave tax relief on training fees - a boost to the 250,000 people a year who finance their own training. Now, with the TECs, we intend to introduce new financial help for career and training guidance.  - BY THE END OF THE NEW PARLIAMENT, THE NEW SYSTEM OF NATIONAL VOCATIONAL QUALIFICATIONS SHOULD COVER VIRTUALLY EVERY OCCUPATION IN THE ECONOMY. THE CBI'S TRAINING TARGETS ENVISAGE 80 PER CENT OF YOUNG PEOPLE REACHING NVQ LEVEL 2 BY THE END OF THE PARLIAMENT.  - WE INTEND TO MAKE TRAINING CREDITS AVAILABLE TO ALL 16 YEAR-OLDS AND 17 YEAR-OLDS WITHIN THE LIFETIME OF THE NEW PARLIAMENT. THE TECS WILL CONTINUE TO BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE YT PROGRAMME FOR THIS AGE GROUP.  - WE WILL CONTINUE TO FINANCE TRAINING PROGRAMMES FOR THE LONG-TERM UN-EMPLOYED AND THOSE WHO FACE PARTICULAR DIFFICULTIES. WE WILL LAUNCH WITH THE TECS A NEW INITIATIVE, GIVING PEOPLE A VOUCHER WITH WHICH THEY CAN BUY A 'SKILL CHECK', PROVIDING ASSESSMENT AND GUIDANCE ON HOW TO MAKE THE MOST OF THEIR WORKING LIVES.  WORKERS AND UNIONS  Over the past 13 years, we have legislated to lift regulatory burdens from the shoulders of those who create jobs in Britain. To industry's relief, we shunned the job-destroying European Social Charter. And we reject Labour's job-destroying notion of a national minimum wage.  We have also legislated five times to transform industrial relations, returning power from militants to ordinary union members. As a result, the number of days lost each year through strikes has fallen from an average 12.9 million in the 1970s to less than a million last year - the lowest figure since records began a century ago.  Labour would disrupt industrial peace by weakening the power of management and the courts. They propose to take away the courts' most important sanction - the power to take over a union's assets.  Sympathy strikes would be legalised by Labour, and employers would be prevented from dismissing strikers who broke their contracts.  The workers' rights we believe in are those which enhance individuals' status and opportunities. We believe people should be informed and consulted by employers about issues which affect their work. No one should be allowed to deduct trade union fees automatically from an employee's pave without written authorisation. Individuals must be given greater rights to belong to the union of their choice.  We also believe strongly that employers, employees and customers should not have their lives and businesses disrupted by wildcat strikes. In the new Parliament, we will legislate to enforce and enhance these rights.  - WE WILL REQUIRE EMPLOYERS TO GIVE EVERYONE WHO WORKS FOR THEM FOR MORE THAN EIGHT HOURS A WEEK A CLEAR 'WRITTEN STATEMENT OF THEIR TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF EMPLOYMENT.  - WE WILL MAKE AUTOMATIC DEDUCTION OF UNION MEMBERSHIP DUES WITHOUT 'WRITTEN AUTHORISATION UNLAWFUL.  - WE WILL TAKE MEASURES TO GIVE INDIVIDUALS GREATER FREEDOM IN CHOOSING A UNION.  - WE WILL LEGISLATE TO REQUIRE THAT ALL PRE- STRIKE BALLOTS ARE POSTAL AND SUBJECT TO INDEPENDENT SCRUTINY, AND THAT AT LEAST SEVEN DAYS' NOTICE OF A STRIKE IS GIVEN AFTER A BALLOT.  - PEOPLE WHO USE PUBLIC SERVICES WILL HAVE THE RIGHT TO RESTRAIN THE DISRUPTION OF THOSE SERVICES BY UNLAWFUL INDUSTRIAL ACTION.  A SHARE IN THE FUTURE  We also believe that people at work should be helped to build security for themselves and their families. Employees should be given every opportunity to acquire a stake in the business for which they work. We have ruled that executive share option schemes may grant options at a discount only if the employer also runs an all-employee scheme.  Saving for a pension reduces reliance on the state. We welcome the provision of occupational schemes covering over 11 million workers. There are already important safeguards, which we have improved, for the rights of members in such schemes. But we believe that a full review of the arrangements is now needed. We also believe that new freedoms for scheme members will strengthen accountability and benefit investors.  - WE WILL ESTABLISH A REVIEW OF THE FRAMEWORK OF LAW AND REGULATION WITHIN WHICH OCCUPATIONAL SCHEMES OPERATE.  - WE WILL GIVE EVERY MEMBER OF AN OCCUPATIONAL SCHEME THE RIGHT TO AN ANNUAL STATEMENT OF THE VALUE OF THEIR SAVINGS.  - IN ADDITION WE WILL EXAMINE WAYS OF GIVING THOSE WHO RETIRE WITH LUMP SUM PAYMENTS MORE CHOICE AS TO HOW THEIR SAVINGS ARE INVESTED.  WOMEN AND OPPORTUNITY  A higher proportion of women go out to work in Britain than in an other EC country except Denmark. Many women choose to work part-time, and our policies have encouraged the development of part-time work within a framework which safeguards employees from exploitation.  Throughout Europe, the UK is recognised to have the most comprehensive legislation to combat sex discrimination. We are also committed to breaking down artificial barriers to women's advancement based on prejudice or lack of imagination. As an employer, government must continue to set an example.  The tax relief we have introduced on training fees is constructed to ensure that non-tax payers - who include many married women - will be able to benefit, too. Many Training and Enterprise Councils already have specific plans to help women trainees. We will involve them further in helping employers to help with childcare.  We believe mothers should be treated equally by government, whether they work outside the home or not. We are fully committed to maintaining the real value of child benefit. And we will act where a push by government is needed to stimulate the provision of childcare.  All employers who meet childcare costs can set these off against their liability for corporation tax. In addition, we have relieved employees from paying income tax on the benefit of workplace nurseries.  After-school childcare is an area of particular importance to many working mothers. We will introduce a new initiative to encourage the provision of after-school facilities by schools, employers and voluntary groups across the country.  - THE GOVERNMENT WILL AMEND THE LAW RELATING TO THE EMPLOYMENT RIGHTS OF PREGNANT WOMEN TO GIVE EFFECT TO THE EC DIRECTIVE ON PREGNANT WORKERS. THIS ADDITION TO OUR ALREADY EXTENSIVE LEGAL PROVISION WILL GIVE A RIGHT TO AT LEAST 14 WEEKS' MATERNITY LEAVE AND PROTECTION AGAINST DISMISSAL ON GROUNDS OF PREGNANCY.  - WE WILL TAKE FORWARD OUR PUBLIC APPOINTMENTS INITIATIVE. DEPARTMENTS WILL PUBLISH PLANS FOR BETWEEN A QUARTER AND A HALF OF PUBLIC APPOINTMENTS TO BE HELD BY WOMEN BY 1996.  - WE WILL ENSURE THAT ALL PARTS OF GOVERNMENT ADOPT A STRATEGIC APPROACH TO THE EMPLOYMENT AND DEVELOPMENT OF WOMEN STAFF. WE WILL ENCOURAGE THEM TO PARTICIPATE IN THE OPPORTUNITY 2000 INITIATIVE.  - WE WILL CONTINUE TO OPPOSE EC MEASURES WHICH WOULD DISCOURAGE PART-TIME EMPLOYMENT, VALUED BY SO MANY WOMEN.  - WE WILL ENCOURAGE ALL TECS TO ADOPT PLANS TO HELP WOMEN TRAINEES HAVE EQUAL ACCESS TO TRAINING OPPORTUNITIES.  - WE WILL INTRODUCE A NEW GRANT, PAID THROUGH TECS, TO HELP EMPLOYERS, VOLUNTARY GROUPS OR SCHOOLS TO SET UP AFTER-SCHOOL CARE AND HOLIDAY ARRANGEMENTS. WE WILL ENSURE THAT SCHOOLS ARE FREE TO PARTICIPATE.  FREEDOM UNDER THE LAW  The Conservative Party has always stood for the protection of the citizen and the defence of the rule of law. Society is entitled to a sense of security; individuals to peace of mind; the guardians of that peace to our whole-hearted support. Our policies on law and order, and the rights of individuals, are designed to protect the people of this country and their way of life.  Britain experiences less violent crime than many comparable countries. But crime has continued to rise in Britain. And the challenge for the 1990s is to step up the fight against lawlessness and violence, so that our citizens can live free from fear.  We must continue to ensure that the sentence fits the crime - with long sentences for dangerous criminals, and fines and a tougher regime for punishment outside prison available as an alternative for less serious crime. And we must maintain confidence in our legal system.  We must tackle crime at its roots. Two-thirds of the offences dealt with by our courts are committed by only seven per cent of those convicted. Most of these constant offenders started down the path of crime while still of school age.  We have launched a reform of our prisons, improving the prospect that those who serve custodial sentences will not return to crime.  But above all we must remember that it is our policemen and women who are in the front line of the battle. To combat crime effectively the police need the full support of the Government and the public.  POLICE AND THE COMMUNITY  We Conservatives can be proud of our record in supporting the police. Since 1979 we have increased spending on the police by 74 per cent in real terms. Uniformed manpower has increased by 16,000 and civilian manpower by 12,000. We have launched a campaign to recruit 10,000 Special Constables.  Over the next few years we want to see a major reform which will help provide what the public wants and needs: a visible, local police presence.  We will be encouraging police forces to develop local Community Policing, to link the police more closely with the communities they protect. The Metropolitan Police will be reorganised on this basis by the spring of 1993. Two-thirds of English and Welsh forces are already preparing similar plans. Pilot schemes suggest they can add greatly to the citizen's sense of security and build support for the police.  Community Policing will involve local residents, listen to their views and engage their help in the fight against crime. It will mean:  - smaller police units with officers serving the same area for longer. That way, people can really get to know their local police officers;  - each police force devolving its management and operational control to local units, and streamlining its chain of command;  - getting police back on the beat, and in close contact with the neighbourhoods under their care.  It will be supported by an extension of Neighbourhood Watch schemes, which are vital in deterring theft and burglaries.  Public confidence in the police is enhanced when people know what they can expect from their local police force, and when outsiders are let into the process of inspecting how they work. At least five police forces are already leading the way with charters setting out their targets.  - WE ARE CONTINUING TO INCREASE POLICE NUMBERS. THERE WILL BE 1,000 EXTRA POLICE OFFICERS THIS YEAR.  - WE WILL CONTINUE TO GIVE THE POLICE THE SUPPORT AND RESOURCES THEY NEED TO CARRY OUT THEIR DUTIES EFFECTIVELY AND EFFICIENTLY.  - WE WILL BE SEEKING THE NATION-WIDE INTRODUCTION OF COMMUNITY POLICING.  - WE WILL ENCOURAGE CIVILIANISATION AS A MEANS OF FREEING POLICE OFFICERS FOR OPERATIONAL DUTIES.  - WE WILL ENCOURAGE THE EXTENSION OF NEIGHBOURHOOD WATCH TO MORE RESIDENTIAL AREAS.  - WE WILL CONTINUE TO INCREASE THE SPECIAL CONSTABULARY, WHICH HAS SEEN A RISE IN RECRUITMENT THIS YEAR OF 10 PER CENT.  - WE WANT EACH POLICE FORCE TO PRODUCE A CHARTER TELLING LOCAL PEOPLE, FOR EXAMPLE, HOW QUICKLY THE POLICE WILL AIM TO RESPOND TO EMERGENCY CALLS.  - WE WILL INTRODUCE LAY INSPECTORS WITH MANAGEMENT EXPERIENCE INTO THE POLICE INSPECTORATE.  PROTECTORS AND VICTIMS  We look to the police to protect us. They risk their lives to do so. Police officers are entitled to the protection of the community they serve. Those who indulge in the shameful practice of 'ambushing', or seeking to frustrate the work of the emergency services, deserve to face severe penalties. We welcome the findings of a study by the Home Office and Crown Prosecution Service which shows that assaults on policemen attract consistently heavier penalties. But we will examine ways of introducing further protection for the police.  We must also pay special attention to the needs of the victims of crime, in the courts and in rebuilding their lives. We have increased funding for Victim Support.  The number of people directly affected by violent and sexual crime remains relatively small. But fear of crime can have a devastating effect on people's lives, and particularly on women's lives. We are determined to reduce this fear.  - We will set up a working party to examine what more can be done to protect the police and members of other emergency services from assault.  - We will encourage victims to report sexual offences by giving them statutory anonymity  - Under our Safer Cities programme, there are 124 schemes to improve street lighting, which has been shown to reduce the fear of crime significantly.  - Women-only taxi services are being encouraged under the same Safer Cities programme.  PENALTIES AND PREVENTION  Our armoury of criminal law and penalties requires constant review. We have just introduced a new law specifically aimed at the so-called 'joy-rider'. This places the responsibility for dangerous driving, damage, injury or death following from the taking of a vehicle squarely on the shoulders of those in it.  Even where 'joy-riding' is not involved, causing death through dangerous or drink driving is a very serious offence. We believe that the maximum sentence for such a crime should reflect its gravity.  Squatting is nothing less than the seizure of another's property without consent. Having consulted widely on the subject, we have decided to extend the criminal law dealing with squatting.  Illegal camping by gypsies or other travellers can affect the lives of whole communities. We believe that this problem must be tackled.  We are concerned about the small but persistent minority, particularly of young people, who re-offend while already on bail. We have announced new measures to deter them from repeated crime.  Young people who find themselves on probation for shop-lifting, vandalism or petty thuggery should be shown where the path of crime may lead. They should be given a brief personal experience of the nature of prison life.  - 'Joy-riders' will now face prison sentences of up to 5 years, unlimited fines and unlimited driving bans.  - We will extend the maximum sentence for causing death through dangerous or drink driving.  - We will create a new criminal offence of squatting, to give greater protection to the owners and occupants of shops, commercial premises, houses and flats.  - The 1968 Caravan Sites Act will be reviewed with the aim of reducing the nuisance of illegal encampments.  - As part of a community sentence, young offenders will be taken to see what life is really like inside one of our prisons - a sobering experience for them.  - We will introduce a new police power to make an arrest for breach of police bail.  - We will give the courts the statutory power to increase sentences for those who offend while on bail.  - We will increase the number of bail hostel places, to enable closer supervision of those on bail.  - We will mount a drive against school truancy, and set up a Task Force to find the best ways of co-ordinating the work of local agencies helping young people at risk of becoming offenders.  REFORMING OUR PRISONS  Prisons should be places which are austere but decent, providing a busy and positive regime which prepares prisoners for their ultimate release.  We have been reversing the Labour Party's neglect of the prison service in the 1970s. Since 1985, 14 new prisons have been opened 7 more will open over the next two years. The end of overcrowding is now in sight.  We have already taken steps to implement the key recommendations of the Woolf report on the future of our prisons. We will bring private sector skills in to enhance efficiency and increase value for money  We have put out to tender the contract for prison escort services, an approach which has worked well in other countries. The first contract for a privately managed remand centre has been awarded.  - WE WILL SUSTAIN OUR MASSIVE PRISON REFORM AND BUILDING PROGRAMME.  - A RECONSTRUCTION PROGRAMME WILL END THE DEGRADING NEED FOR 'SLOPPING OUT' BY THE END OF 1994.  - WE WILL REORGANISE PRISONERS' EDUCATION, TRAINING AND WORK OPPORTUNITIES.  - WE WILL ESTABLISH THE PRISON SERVICE AS A SEPARATE AGENCY, WHOSE DIRECTOR WILL HAVE THE CLEAR RESPONSIBILITY FOR DAY-TO DAY OPERATIONS. THE HOME SECRETARY WILL REMAIN MINISTERIALLY ACCOUNTABLE TO PARLIAMENT FOR PRISON POLICY.  - WE WILL INCREASE THE USE OF PRIVATE SECTOR MANAGEMENT SKILLS.  OUR LEGAL SYSTEM  As a free society we must have a justice system that is fair, accessible and responsive to the citizen.  We have introduced new powers for the Court of Appeal to increase sentences for crime. And in response to public concern about a small but significant number of miscarriages of justice, we have appointed a Royal Commission to review aspects of the criminal justice system, including the conduct of investigations, the handling of forensic evidence, and the powers of the Court of Appeal.  We have already reduced the opportunity for abuse by our introduction of tape-recorded interviews of suspects by the police. At the same time, we are concerned that police investigations should not be made more difficult by the misuse of certain rights.  We have already introduced a wide range of reforms following our Civil Justice Review. Extending the jurisdiction of the County Courts has helped speed up justice. The success of the small claims system in these courts has shown that simplified procedures can enable people to conduct their own cases or rely on a lay adviser. We have also introduced a reform which will give people more choice as to who represents them legally in court.  We are committed to enabling people with limited means to have access to legal services. We are determined to ensure that these services are delivered efficiently, in a way which provides the best value for money.  The principles of the Citizen's Charter are being applied to our legal system. We will shortly be publishing a Courts Charter.  We are overhauling the way in which family matters are handled in our courts. The new family code will be applied by magistrates and judges especially trained in family law.  Our Sunday Trading laws have come into question as a result of a possible conflict with Article 30 of the Treaty of Rome. This matter is now before the European Court of Justice, and we are awaiting a judgement. The Government brought forward proposals in 1986 to reform the shopping laws, but Parliament was not able to agree a conclusion. Parliament will be given the opportunity to consider this issue again.  - WE WILL INTRODUCE A MAJOR CRIMINAL JUSTICE BILL IN THE LIFETIME OF THE NEW PARLIAMENT.  - WE WILL EXTEND THE TYPES OF CASES WHICH CAN BE HANDLED BY THE COUNTY COURTS IN A SIMPLIFIED WAY.  - WE WILL CONSULT ON A LAY ADJUDICATORS SCHEME TO MAKE IT EASIER FOR CITIZENS TO SETTLE DISPUTES WITH SERVICE PROVIDERS.  - WE WILL PROVIDE A CODE OF FAMILY LAW THAT WILL CONTINUE TO UNDERPIN THE INSTITUTION OF MARRIAGE, GIVE PRIORITY TO THE WELFARE OF THE CHILD, AND EMPHASISE THE PRIMARY RESPONSIBILITY OF PARENTS FOR THE WELFARE OF CHILDREN AND THE FAMILY.  - WE WILL BRING FORWARD PROPOSALS FOR REFORM OF THE SUNDAY TRADING LAWS ONCE THE LEGAL POSITION HAS BEEN MADE CLEAR BY THE EUROPEAN COURT OF JUSTICE.  PORNOGRAPHY, PRIVACY, LIBEL  We have the toughest anti-pornography laws in Western Europe, and we will keep them that way.  Every year, about 300,000 people - mostly women - request advice and assistance in dealing with obscene or malicious phone calls. We intend to do more to deter this harassment, in conjunction with the telecommunications industry.  The Press Complaints Commission is now in operation, and we will monitor its work carefully to see if self-regulation succeeds.  The public's dislike of unprincipled press behaviour has sometimes been expressed in the award of erratically large libel damages. While this is understandable, it has led to an inordinate number of successful appeals. We therefore propose to simplify the law relating to libel in the light of the recommendations of the Neill Committee.  - BRITISH DOMESTIC CONTROLS ON PORNOGRAPHY WILL REMAIN IN PLACE EVEN AFTER THE COMPLETION OF THE SINGLE EUROPEAN MARKET.  - WE WILL INCREASE THE MAXIMUM PENALTIES FOR MAKING OBSCENE OR MALICIOUS PHONE CALLS.  - WE PROPOSE TO ALLOW JUDGES TO SETTLE THE LEVEL OF DAMAGES IN LIBEL CASES WHERE THE DEFENDANT OFFERS TO PAY TO MAKE AMENDS.  COMMUNITY RELATIONS  Racial harmony demands restraint on all sides, and a tolerant understanding of the legitimate views of others.  Everybody, regardless of ethnic background, religious or personal belief, has the right to go about his or her life free from the threat of intimidation and assault. We are determined that everyone lawfully settled in this country should enjoy the full range of opportunities in our society That requires openness on the part of the majority and, on the part of the ethnic minorities themselves, a determination to participate fully in the life of the wider community.  The Home Office invests £129 million in grants designed to encourage those running public services to ensure that people from ethnic minorities can enjoy the full range of public services - such as health, housing and social services. We believe that these grants would be more effective if responsibility was transferred to those Departments which can make best use of the money.  - RACIAL AND SEXUAL DISCRIMINATION HAVE NO PLACE IN OUR SOCIETY. WE HAVE GIVEN THE POLICE STRONGER POWERS TO DEAL WITH RACIAL HATRED. WE WILL CONTINUE TO ENSURE THAT THE FULL FORCE OF THE LAW IS USED TO DEAL WITH RACIAL ATTACKS.  - WE WILL TRANSFER THE EDUCATION SHARE OF THE HOME OFFICE'S 'SECTION 11' MONEY TO THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION, TO FOCUS HELP ON THOSE FROM ETHNIC MINORITY BACKGROUNDS WHO NEED ADDITIONAL ENGLISH LANGUAGE TEACHING.  IMMIGRATION AND REFUGEES  Good community relations in this country depend upon a clear structure of immigration controls which are fair, understandable and properly enforced. We are determined to maintain our present system of immigration controls unless we have evidence that other arrangements would be equally satisfactory and cost-effective.  But an increasing number of would-be immigrants from Eastern Europe and other parts of the world seek to abuse our openness to genuine refugees. The number of people seeking refugee status has risen from 5,000 a year to 45,000 over the past four years.  We will continue to honour our commitment to the 1951 UN Convention, and give refuge to those who reach our shores with a well-founded fear of persecution.  - IN THE NEW PARLIAMENT WE MUST THEREFORE REINTRODUCE THE ASYLUM BILL, OPPOSED BY LABOUR AND THE LIBERAL DEMOCRATS, TO CREATE A FASTER AND MORE EFFECTIVE SYSTEM OF DETERMINING WHO ARE GENUINE POLITICAL REFUGEES, AND WHO ARE NOT.  - WE WILL PROVIDE A FAIR AND EXPEDITIOUS SYSTEM FOR EXAMINING CLAIMS FOR REFUGEE STATUS. THIS WILL INCLUDE A WORKABLE APPEAL SYSTEM FOR APPLICANTS UNDER WHICH THOSE WITH MANIFESTLY UNFOUNDED CLAIMS WILL BE RETURNED QUICKLY TO THEIR OWN COUNTRY OR TO THE COUNTRY THEY CAME FROM.  - FINGER-PRINTING WILL BE INTRODUCED FOR ASYLUM APPLICANTS, TO PREVENT MULTIPLE APPLICATIONS AND FRAUDULENT BENEFIT CLAIMS.  THE DANGER OF DRUGS  Illegal drug abuse poses a major threat to the fabric of our society. It can destroy the health and lives of young people in particular. We will tackle this problem with vigour.  We have already taken action on a wide front:  - we have set up co-ordinators in every local education authority to train teachers about the harm drugs can do, and to bring the fight against drug abuse into the classroom;  - we have set up 16 local drug prevention teams in inner cities to tackle particular problem areas;  - we have created the National Drugs Intelligence Unit at New Scotland Yard;  - we have taken the lead in Europe in pressing for the establishment of a Europe-wide Drugs Unit, as a first step towards a creation of a  - we have set up a network of 31 drug liaison officers, in 19 different countries, tracking the international drugs traffickers who threaten Britain with their trade.  We now have the toughest sanctions in Western Europe against drug traffickers.  A number of public services and voluntary bodies are engaged in fighting drug misuse at local level. Such efforts need co-ordination to ensure that local effort and dedication is directed to best effect.  - WE WILL NOT LEGALISE ANY BANNED DRUGS.  - WE WILL BRING FORWARD PROPOSALS TO ENSURE THAT THE CONTROL OF DRUG MISUSE IS CO-ORDINATED EFFECTIVELY.  - WE INTEND TO STRENGTHEN OUR CONFISCATORY POWERS STILL FURTHER. AND WE WILL ENSURE THAT OUR CONTROLS AGAINST DRUG-TRAFFICKING ARE NOT WEAKENED BY ANY CHANGES IN EUROPE.  - WE WILL MAKE IT AN OFFENCE TO SUPPLY ANABOLIC STEROIDS TO MINORS.  THE THREAT OF TERRORISM  Tragic and dangerous events remind us only too frequently of the need for the special measures provided by the Prevention of Terrorism Act. While Labour proposes to weaken or dismantle them, we know that for the safety of our citizens they must be continued, and the police effort against terrorism must be reinforced.  We have set up in New Scotland Yard arrangements to co-ordinate the activities of all our police forces in the fight against terrorism.  - WE WILL PROVIDE THE NECESSARY MEASURES AND RESOURCES TO COMBAT TERRORISM, WHETHER IT COMES FROM THE IRA OR OTHER EVIL GROUPS WHO SEEK TO UNDERMINE OUR DEMOCRACY.  RESPONSIBILITY FOR OTHERS  Conservatives believe we have responsibility one for another. We will continue to care for those in need and work to establish a society that is generous, as well as prosperous. Our health, care and social security systems are fundamental to government responsibilities; and we believe strongly in fostering voluntary services too.  THE NHS - PRESENT AND FUTURE  The Conservative Party is totally committed to the National Health Service. The Government has set out in the Patient's Charter the principles on which the NHS is based. The most fundamental of these is that need, and not ability to pay, is and will remain the basis on which care is offered to all by the NHS. Since 1979, there have been great improvements in the health of the nation.  - Life expectancy has increased by two years.  - Deaths amongst babies and very young children have gone down by 40 per cent.  - hospitals are treating well over a million more people a year as in-patients.  - hospitals are treating over two million more people a year as out-patients.  - kidney transplants have more than doubled.  - hip replacements have increased by over 50 per cent.  - coronary artery by-passes have nearly tripled.  Since 1979 the Government has vastly increased the resources available to the NHS.  - We have increased overall funding for the NHS by 55 per cent after allowing for inflation. The cash increases in each of the three years up to 1992-93 have been the biggest ever.  - The number of doctors and dentists has been increased by 17,000, and the real resources committed to GP services have doubled since 1979.  - The number of nurses and midwives has gone up by 69,000.  - We have established the independent Pay Review Body which nurses had sought for so long, and increased their pay by 43 per cent. It is hard now to remember that Labour actually cut nurses' pay.  - We have restored the hospital building programme so savagely cut by Labour at the end of their last term of office.  But the Conservative Government has not simply spent more money on the NHS.  - We have reformed the organisation of the NHS to encourage those working in the service to respond to what patients want and need, and to get the most out of the increased money which the taxpayer provides.  At local level, health authorities now have the task of buying health care with their local share of the National Health budget. Hospitals can now be run by their own local team of doctors, nurses and managers. By April there will be 156 NHS Trusts whose local boards will have extra freedoms to develop local NHS services. Another 156 hospitals have applied to become trusts from April 1993.  We have acted to reduce the long hours worked by junior doctors in hospitals. For the first time limits are being set on the number of hours which may be worked continuously.  Good nursing is the essential complement to good medicine. We have introduced Project 2000 - a new approach to the professional training of nurses.  The GP has a crucial role to play in the development of health services. Under the Government's fund- holding initiative, doctors have control over their own spending on behalf of patients for the first time. Over 3,000 GPs will be fundholders by April, caring for 14 per cent of NHS patients. A further 2,500 are preparing to become fundholders in April 1993. As a result, new services are being offered at local surgeries and health centres. Many general practitioners have said that they would like to become involved in fund-holding. We have already extended the scope of the fund-holding scheme to allow general practitioners to provide services such as community nursing.  - WE WILL, YEAR BY YEAR, INCREASE THE LEVEL OF REAL RESOURCES COMMITTED TO THE NHS. SAVINGS MADE THROUGH GREATER EFFICIENCY WILL BE PLOUGHED BACK INTO THE SERVICE.  - WE WILL DEVELOP A COMPREHENSIVE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT STRATEGY FOR THE NHS.  - WE WILL CONTINUE TO DEVELOP THE NHS TRUST MOVEMENT WHICH PLACES RESPONSIBILITY FOR MANAGING HOSPITALS AND OTHER SERVICES WITH LOCAL TEAMS WHO ARE CLOSEST TO PATIENTS.  - WE WILL CONTINUE TO ENCOURAGE THE INVOLVEMENT OF DOCTORS AND OTHER MEDICAL STAFF IN THE MANAGEMENT OF SERVICES.  - WE WILL INTRODUCE POWERS FOR NURSES TO PRESCRIBE WHERE APPROPRIATE.  - WE WILL COMPLETE THE IMPLEMENTATION OF PROJECT 2000 TRAINING FOR NURSES.  - WE WILL SET GOALS FOR THE EMPLOYMENT OF WOMEN IN PROFESSIONAL AND MANAGERIAL POSTS IN THE NHS.  - WE WILL ENSURE THAT, FOLLOWING MATERNITY LEAVE OR A CAREER BREAK, ALL WOMEN WORKING IN THE NHS, INCLUDING THOSE RETURNING TO NURSING ON A PART-TIME OR JOB-SHARING BASIS, ARE ABLE TO RETURN TO WORK OF A SIMILAR STATUS OR LEVEL TO THAT WHICH THEY LEFT.  - WE WILL ENSURE THAT THE BENEFITS OF FUND- HOLDING ARRANGEMENTS ARE AVAILABLE TO ANY GP WHO WISHES TO APPLY, AND WE WILL BE READY TO EXTEND THE SCOPE OF THE SCHEME FURTHER AS IT DEVELOPS.  THE PATIENT'S CHARTER  No one questions the dedication of those who work in the NHS But before the Government's reforms, the system did not always allow that dedication to produce the service which people should be able to expect.  The Patient's Charter sets out clearly what is now expected from the NHS. We have already pledged that in future no one will wait more than two years for treatment on the NHS. In many parts of the country for most treatments, the waiting time is much shorter than this; and we will seek further progress in reducing waiting times.  - BINDING GUARANTEES WILL BE SET LOCALLY FOR IN-PATIENT WAITING TIMES, STARTING WITH THE OPERATIONS WHERE WAITING CAUSES MOST DISTRESS. TO ENSURE THAT PROGRESS ON WAITING TIMES CONTINUES, WE INTEND THAT FROM 31 MARCH 1993, NO ONE SHOULD HAVE TO WAIT MORE THAN 18 MONTHS FOR A HIP OR KNEE REPLACEMENT, OR A CATARACT OPERATION. WE ARE SURE THAT, AS NOW, MANY HOSPITALS WILL BE ABLE TO DO BETTER THAN THIS.  - WE WILL MOVE TO A SYSTEM UNDER WHICH A NAMED NURSE OR MIDWIFE WILL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR YOUR CARE WHILE YOU ARE IN HOSPITAL.  - WE WILL SET SPECIFIC TARGETS FOR OUT PATIENT WAITING TIMES.  - WE WILL MAKE IT EASIER FOR PATIENTS TO FIND OUT WHAT SERVICES ARE AVAILABLE FROM THE NHS VIA A NEW NATIONAL NHS INFORMATION SERVICE.  - WE WILL ENSURE THAT COMPARATIVE INFORMATION ABOUT THE HEALTH STANDARDS ACHIEVED BY HEALTH AUTHORITIES IS AVAILABLE TO THE PUBLIC.  - SIMPLE SYSTEMS WILL BE SET UP TO ALLOW COMPLAINTS TO BE REGISTERED AND RESPONSES GIVEN IF THINGS GO WRONG.  STRATEGY FOR HEALTH  This Government has embarked on the first ever strategy for health. Good health requires more than good NHS care when people are sick. A variety of factors - including preventive medicine, diet, exercise, sensible drinking and not smoking - can contribute substantially to improving health across the whole population.  - WE WILL SET HEALTH OBJECTIVES TO BE ACHIEVED BY THE END OF THE CENTURY, INCLUDING REDUCTIONS IN ILLNESS AND DEATH FROM HEART DISEASE AND CANCERS.  - WE WILL ADD NEW HEALTH OBJECTIVES AS THE STRATEGY DEVELOPS.  CARE SERVICES  Care services for children, the elderly and the handicapped are provided by local government, health authorities, the private sector and voluntary groups, not directly by central government. But government is indirectly involved as the provider of taxpayers money and through its duty to set standards for publicly and privately provided care.  As the number of elderly people in the population grows, there will be more frail and vulnerable citizens who need support. Many of them will want to be cared for at home. Others will need residential or nursing home care. It is vital that people should have choice in the type of care available. In all cases people must be able to rely on the quality of care. As we move towards implementation of 'Caring for People' in April 1993:  - WE WILL TAKE STEPS TO ENSURE THAT INDIVIDUALS WHO NEED RESIDENTIAL OR NURSING CARE CONTINUE TO HAVE A CHOICE OF HOMES, INCLUDING INDEPENDENT HOMES. MONEY TRANSFERRED FROM THE SOCIAL SECURITY BUDGET TO LOCAL SOCIAL SERVICES DEPARTMENTS WILL BE USED FOR THIS PURPOSE.  - WE WILL ENSURE THAT ALL LOCAL AUTHORITIES PUBLISH INFORMATION ABOUT THE SOCIAL SERVICES THAT ARE AVAILABLE, INCLUDING INFORMATION ON STANDARDS AND COMPLAINTS PROCEDURES.  - WE WILL PROVIDE CHOICE IN DOMICILIARY AND DAY CARE.  - WE WILL PROVIDE FURTHER FUNDING FOR VOLUNTARY ORGANISATIONS TO PLAY THEIR VITAL PART IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF COMMUNITY CARE SERVICES.  - WE WILL SUPPORT THE ORGANISATIONS WHICH HELP THOSE WHO CARE FOR FRIENDS AND RELATIVES AT HOME.  CHILDREN  This Government introduced the Children Act, a landmark in legislation to protect children. The Act requires childcare facilities to be registered to ensure that standards are maintained throughout the country  We believe that the diversity of childcare provision in the UK is one of its strengths. It offers parents real choice. Over 90 per cent of 3-4 year-olds are engaged in some form of group activity We shall continue to encourage the development of childcare arrangements in the voluntary and independent sectors.  - EACH LOCAL AUTHORITY WILL BE ASKED TO PRODUCE A LOCAL CHILDCARE PLAN SETTING OUT THE PROVISION AVAILABLE IN THEIR AREA.  - WE WILL ENSURE THAT THE STANDARDS IMPLEMENTED THROUGH THE CHILDREN ACT ARE APPLIED SENSIBLY, AND DO NOT DISCOURAGE PRIVATE OR VOLUNTARY ARRANGEMENTS WHICH ARE OFTEN BEST SUITED TO THE NEEDS OF CHILDREN AND PARENTS.  - WE WILL CARRY FORWARD A FAMILY SUPPORT INITIATIVE, ENCOURAGING THE VOLUNTARY SECTOR TO WORK IN PARTNERSHIP WITH FAMILIES AND LOCAL AUTHORITIES.  SOCIAL SECURITY  Our aim is to improve further and modernise Britain's social security system. We are providing more support than ever before £14 for every £10 spent in 1979, after allowing for inflation. More importantly, this extra help is more clearly focused on those groups with the greatest needs - less well-off pensioners, disabled people and low income families.  We have also sought to provide those on social security with better incentives to earn, and gain independence. All too often the old system created barriers to work and penalised the thrifty.  The benefit structure is now more flexible and easier to understand. The new Benefits Agency is simplifying forms and widening choice in methods of payment. We will complete the massive investment in new technology - Europe's biggest computerisation project - that has made it possible to raise the quality of service to the public. And we will extend 'Helplines' and other means of assistance with individual difficulties.  - WE WILL CONTINUE TO SIMPLIFY SOCIAL SECURITY FORMS WHEREVER POSSIBLE.  - WE WILL SET UP A NEW FAMILY CREDIT TELEPHONE ADVICE SERVICE TO SUPPORT WORKING FAMILIES.  - WE WILL ESTABLISH A NEW AGENCY TO CARRY OUT ALL SOCIAL SECURITY WAR PENSIONS WORK WITH THE AIM OF PROVIDING A BETTER, MORE EFFICIENT SERVICE TO WAR PENSIONERS AND WAR WIDOWS.  SECURITY IN RETIREMENT  Britain's pensioners recognise the security that Conservative government brings - low inflation, savings that grow, firmness in the face of crime, public services that put the customer first. Those who have dedicated their lives to the service of the community deserve that stability  We will continue to give the fight against inflation our first priority The basic state retirement pension will remain the foundation for retirement. We will continue to protect its value against price rises, as we have for the last 13 years.  We also recognise that some pensioners, who have no savings or pensions from their jobs, need extra help. So we will increase the additional support, already up by over £300 million a year since 1989, available to less well-off pensioners.  The number of those over pensionable age will be far higher in the next century than it is today If we do not make provision now; the burden we will place on our children will be too great. That is why we must encourage people to build up savings, investments, and occupational and personal pensions.  But Labour policy is hostile to such personal effort; Labour wants pensioners to depend on the State. Failure to control inflation meant that pensioners' incomes from savings were cut under the last Labour Government.  About eight in ten pensioners have some sort of second income to top up their state pension. By abolishing the hated earnings rule we have enabled pensioners to keep their retirement pension, even if they take a job in retirement. And we have increased the level of savings that is disregarded in working out entitlement to benefits for pensioners. Personal pensions have brought real choice into retirement provision. Over 4½ million people have set up their own pensions since 1988. We want to see both occupational and personal provision expand much further in the course of the 1990s. (See 'Opportunity for all - A share in the future' for our proposals on occupational pensions.)  - AS EVIDENCE OF OUR CONTINUING COMMITMENT TO POORER PENSIONERS, WE HAVE ANNOUNCED IN THE BUDGET AN INCREASE OF £2 A WEEK FOR SINGLE PEOPLE, £3 A WEEK FOR COUPLES, IN INCOME SUPPORT FOR PENSIONERS. COMBINED WITH THE INCREASES THIS APRIL, THIS MEASURE WILL PROVIDE LESS WELL-OFF PENSIONERS WITH BETWEEN £5.73 AND £10.70 A WEEK EXTRA.  - WE WILL CONTINUE TO PAY, FROM APRIL 1993, A REBATE AT THE LEVEL RECOMMENDED BY THE GOVERNMENT ACTUARY FOR ALL THOSE WHO CONTRACT OUT OF THE STATE EARNINGS. RELATED PENSION SCHEME.  - WE WILL LEGISLATE TO PROVIDE A NEW 1 PER CENT INCENTIVE FOR HOLDERS OF PERSONAL PENSIONS AGED 30 AND OVER FROM APRIL 1993, WHEN THE EXISTING INCENTIVE ENDS.  - WE WILL CONSIDER PROPOSALS FOR A NEW SYSTEM OF REBATES TO COME INTO EFFECT FROM APRIL 1996 WITH THE AIM OF ENSURING THAT PERSONAL PENSIONS REMAIN ATTRACTIVE ACROSS THE AGE RANGE.  - WE ARE FIRMLY COMMITTED TO EQUAL TREATMENT FOR MEN AND WOMEN IN PENSIONS. FOLLOWING ASSESSMENT OF THE RESPONSES TO OUR DISCUSSION PAPER, WE WILL BRING FORWARD LEGISLATION TO ACHIEVE THIS.  SUPPORTING FAMILIES  Our reforms have cut away the barriers that meant many breadwinners lost money if they went to work. Family Credit has transformed the prospects of 350,000 low-income families. As a result of improvements since 1988, we have made available an extra £600 million a year in real terms to low- income families with children.  But we also recognise that all families face extra costs in bringing up children. So we have raised Child Benefit. For a two-child family the increases we are making will, by April 1992, have raised the total value of Child Benefit by almost £3 in a single year, to £17.45 a week.  Our new Child Support Agency will make sure that absent parents make a proper contribution - and that far more lone parents and their children get the maintenance that is theirs by right. And benefit changes make it easier for more families - including single parents - to combine work and family responsibilities.  - CHILD BENEFIT WILL REMAIN THE CORNERSTONE OF OUR POLICY FOR ALL FAMILIES WITH CHILDREN. ITS VALUE WILL INCREASE EACH YEAR IN LINE WITH PRICES.  - CHILD BENEFIT WILL CONTINUE TO BE PAID TO ALL FAMILIES, NORMALLY TO THE MOTHER, AND IN RESPECT OF ALL CHILDREN.  HELP FOR DISABLED PEOPLE  Under the Conservatives, more disabled people than ever before are getting the help they need and deserve. Since 1979, the number receiving Attendance Allowance has more than trebled; the number receiving Mobility Allowance has risen six fold; the number receiving Invalid Care Allowance has risen 25-fold. Today we spend some £12,000 million a year on benefits for long-term sick and disabled people. Even after allowing for inflation, that is 2½ times as much as Labour spent in the 1970s.  - Disability Living Allowance will bring together the existing Attendance and Mobility Allowance, providing new help to many disabled people who at present get no such help. Disability Working Allowance will make it easier for disabled people to take up a job.  - WE ARE INTRODUCING NEW DISABILITY BENEFITS WHICH WILL, IN THE NEXT PARLIAMENT, BRING EXTRA HELP TO AT LEAST 300,000 PEOPLE. BY 1993-94 THESE AND OTHER IMPROVEMENTS WILL MEAN THAT WE WILL BE DIRECTING AN EXTRA £300 MILLION A YEAR TO LONG-TERM SICK AND DISABLED PEOPLE.  - THE INDEPENDENT LIVING FUND HAS PROVED A GREAT SUCCESS IN GIVING SEVERELY DISABLED PEOPLE AN OPPORTUNITY TO LIVE IN THE COMMUNITY. WE ARE COMMITTED TO MAINTAINING A FLUID WHICH SUPPORTS THE MOST SEVERELY DISABLED PEOPLE.  THE VOLUNTARY SECTOR  Charities and voluntary groups play a vital role in our national life. Britain is rich in its citizens' willingness to give time, effort and money to helping others. We have a great tradition of voluntary work at home and overseas. There are now about 350,000 voluntary groups in Britain - and personal donations to charities now amount to some £5,000 million a year.  We have done much to boost charitable giving.  - Under the Payroll Giving Scheme, employees can now contribute up to £50 a month tax-free.  - Gifts and bequests have been exempted from Inheritance Tax.  - The Gift Aid scheme allows charities to claim tax relief on one-off gifts of more than £400 - a change just announced in the Budget.  - The maximum limit on single charitable gifts qualifying for Income and Corporation Tax relief has been abolished.  The new Charities legislation will ensure that charities are better managed and properly regulated. We believe this will enhance public confidence in charities and further boost charitable giving.  The Government gives some £2,500 million a year to support the activities of the voluntary sector (including housing associations). Industry has been generous with its sponsorship and with technical support. But money is not the only contribution that government and business can make. Businesses have become much more practically involved in work in the community And government could do more to encourage new forms of volunteering, to encourage the most effective use of the money it gives, and to bring together voluntary effort at the local and national level.  - WE WILL CONTINUE TO SUPPORT THE WORK OF THE VOLUNTARY SECTOR AND PROMOTE VOLUNTEERING.  - WE WILL WORK WITH VOLUNTARY AGENCIES TO DEVELOP, OVER THE LIFE OF THE NEXT PARLIAMENT, A NATIONAL BANK OF INFORMATION ON OPPORTUNITIES FOR VOLUNTEERING.  - WE WILL ENCOURAGE EFFORTS TO IMPROVE THE CO-ORDINATION AND PROMOTE THE GROWTH OF LOCAL VOLUNTEER SUPPORT, BUILDING ON THE SUCCESS OF NEIGHBOURHOOD WATCH TO DEVELOP A NETWORK OF VOLUNTARY HELP IN LOCAL COMMUNITIES.  ANIMAL WELFARE  We are leading the European Community in our achievements in improving animal welfare. We have also taken action at home and abroad to improve conservation, and will continue to do so.  English Nature, which advises the Government on wildlife issues, has embarked on an ambitious programme to restore endangered species. The Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 provides special protection for 304 species of birds and animals, as well as protecting our heritage of wild plants.  We are firmly opposed to international trade in rare and protected species such as rhinoceroses, cheetahs, leopards, and bears. We have pushed successfully for an EC ban on large-scale drift nets that threatened dolphins, and we support the UN resolution calling for a moratorium on their use. We support the extension of the moratorium on commercial whaling and have co-sponsored resolutions against 'scientific' hunting of whales. We have successfully pressed for an EC ban on the importation of baby seal products and of furs from those countries which permit leghold traps.  We have set up the Farm Animal Welfare Council and have brought in welfare codes covering livestock on farms and in transit. We are establishing an ethical committee to look at the effects of advanced techniques in animal breeding. We have banned the use of veal crates, and taken action to ensure humane slaughter. We insisted that we should retain our power to stop the export of live horses. At Maastricht we secured a landmark in animal welfare: our partners' agreement to a declaration that the welfare of animals should be taken into account in the framing of EC legislation.  We now have the toughest set of controls on animal experimentation in Europe, and the number of animals used in experiments has fallen steadily We have supported stronger laws to protect badgers and stop cruel tethering, and have increased the penalties for organising animal fights and for cruelty.  - WE WILL INTRODUCE A WILDLIFE ENHANCEMENT SCHEME AND EXPAND THE SPECIES RECOVERY SCHEME, BOTH TO BE RUN BY ENGLISH NATURE.  - WE HAVE TIGHTENED CONTROLS ON THE IMPORT OF WILD BIRDS AND WILL PRESS THE EC TO DO THE SAME.  - WE OPPOSE RESUMPTION OF THE TRADE IN IVORY OR ELEPHANT PRODUCTS, AND WILL PROVIDE ADDITIONAL SUPPORT FOR ELEPHANT CONSERVATION PROJECTS IN AFRICA.  - WE WILL URGE OUR EC PARTNERS TO BRING ANIMAL WELFARE STANDARDS UP TO UK LEVELS, FOR EXAMPLE BY BANNING VEAL CRATES AND STALLS AND TETHERS FOR PIGS. WE WILL PRESS THEM TO PUT INTO PRACTICE THE PRINCIPLES OF THE MAASTRICHT DECLARATION.  - WE WILL USE OUR EC PRESIDENCY TO TOUGHEN UP EC REGULATIONS AND IMPROVE EC COMPLIANCE WITH RULES GOVERNING ANIMAL EXPERIMENTS.  - WE WILL PRESS FOR HIGHER EC STANDARDS FOR THE KEEPING OF BATTERY HENS AND FOR THE CARE OF ANIMALS IN TRANSIT.  - WE WILL NOT ACCEPT ANY WEAKENING OF OUR RABIES PREVENTION SAFEGUARDS.  A BRIGHTER BRITAIN  Making Britain a brighter and better place in which to live requires a high quality physical environment - including housing, transport and reinvigorated urban areas. The Conservative commitment is both to the re-creation of our civic pride and also to the preservation and integrity of our rural heritage, founded on the core industry of agriculture. Our aim is to enhance the quality of life for the British people.  HOME OWNERSHIP  The opportunity to own a home and pass it on is one of the most important rights an individual has in a free society Conservatives have extended that right. It lies at the heart of our philosophy We want to see wealth and security being passed down from generation to generation. Some 4 million more householders own their own homes compared with 1979. The number of former council tenants who have bought their homes has risen to 1.4 million.  We now need to make it easier for those council tenants living in high-cost areas or on low incomes to move gradually into home ownership, without taking on too heavy a financial burden at any one time. This will bring the benefits of home ownership within the reach of more people and introduce more diversity in local authority estates. We also want to help more leaseholders to own and control the management of their property.  But we recognise that not everyone can, or will want to, buy his or her home. So we are determined to encourage a strong private rented sector while continuing to safeguard the rights of existing regulated tenants. Bringing empty private sector dwellings back into use will extend choice, make it easier for people to move jobs, and help tackle homelessness.  - WE WILL MAINTAIN MORTGAGE TAX RELIEF.  - WE WILL CONTINUE 'RIGHT TO BUY' DISCOUNTS, AND ENSURE THAT LOCAL AUTHORITIES RESPOND REASONABLY AND RAPIDLY TO APPLICATIONS.  - WE WILL INTRODUCE A NEW NATION-WIDE 'RENTS TO MORTGAGES' SCHEME, ENABLING COUNCIL TENANTS TO TAKE A PART-SHARE IN THEIR HOME, GRADUALLY STEPPING UP TO FULL OWNERSHIP.  - WE WILL PUT MORE OF THE HOUSING CORPORATION'S £2,000 MILLION BUDGET INTO DO-IT-YOURSELF SHARED OWNERSHIP. THIS WILL ENABLE FIRST TIME BUYERS TO CHOOSE A HOME AND BUY A SHARE OF IT - USUALLY 50 PER CENT - WITH A HOUSING ASSOCIATION PAYING RENT ON THE REST UNTIL THEY WISH TO INCREASE THEIR STAKE IN THE PROPERTY.  - WE WILL INTRODUCE 'COMMONHOLD' LEGISLATION, GIVING RESIDENTIAL LEASEHOLDERS LIVING IN BLOCKS OF FLATS THE RIGHT TO ACQUIRE THE FREEHOLD OF THEIR BLOCK AT THE MARKET RATE. LEASEHOLDERS OF HIGHER RATED HOUSES WILL ALSO BE GIVEN THE RIGHT TO BUY THE FREEHOLD OF THEIR PROPERTY. LEASEHOLDERS WHO LIVE IN A BLOCK WHICH DOES NOT QUALIFY WILL HAVE A NEW RIGHT TO BUY AN EXTENDED LEASE.  - WE WILL INTRODUCE STATUTORY TIME LIMITS FOR ANSWERS BY LOCAL AUTHORITIES TO STANDARD INQUIRIES BY HOUSE-BUYERS, AND EXPLORE THE IDEA OF A NEW COMPUTERISED PROPERTY DATA BANK BRINGING TOGETHER INFORMATION HELD BY THE LAND REGISTRY AND OTHER PUBLIC BODIES.  - WE WILL EXTEND NATION-WIDE THE SCHEME WE HAVE PILOTED TO INCREASE PRIVATE RENTING, WHEREBY HOUSING ASSOCIATIONS MANAGE PROPERTIES, BUILDING TRUST BETWEEN TENANT AND PRIVATE SECTOR LANDLORD.  - AS SOON AS POSSIBLE IN THE NEW PARLIAMENT, WE WILL INTRODUCE A FLEW 'RENT A ROOM' SCHEME WIDER WHICH HOME-OWNERS WILL BE ABLE TO LET ROOMS TO LODGERS WITHOUT HAYING TO PAY TAX ON THE RENT THEY RECEIVE.  MEETING HOUSING NEED  We are also committed to securing a better deal for council tenants and increasing the supply of affordable housing for those in housing need. We will introduce more choice, improve management of estates and create new rights as part of the Tenant's Charter. Our aim will be to give tenants a choice of landlord wherever possible, and make management of both council and housing association stock more responsive to the needs of tenants.  We will improve the way in which council housing is managed by bringing in new private sector providers operating on contract to the local authority We will introduce more competition and choice, thereby improving services to the tenant and increasing accountability. And we intend to give council tenants new opportunities themselves to improve the flat or house in which they live.  We have already begun a process of Large-Scale Voluntary Transfer which allows local authority tenants to opt to transfer to a housing association. We wish to see this result in diversity, not local monopoly, and will therefore act to limit the size of blocks that can be transferred.  Nearly all new social housing is now being built by housing associations. Over the next three years, we are committed to spend nearly £6,000 million through the Housing Corporation to provide 153,000 homes.  We will do more to bring into use properties owned by central and local government which are standing empty for no good reason. This will enable us to house more people on the waiting list and, in some cases, to provide more opportunities for homesteading.  Through Estate Action and Housing Action Trusts we have invested £1,000 million in recent years in a concentrated attack on the country's worst housing estates. Some 360,000 dwellings have been improved as a result. As part of those programmes, on which we are committed to spend a further £1,400 million over the next three years, we are demolishing or redesigning tower blocks and deck access estates, rebuilding on a more human scale. Wherever we can, whenever tenants want it, and where resources allow; we will pull down the eyesores which have blotted our cityscapes and too often provided breeding grounds for crime and delinquency.  The Government is spending about £100 million tackling the problem of rough sleeping in our cities. As a result we have seen a sharp fall in the numbers who sleep rough on our streets. Working closely with the voluntary sector we will continue to provide help for those sleeping rough, particularly in the capital.  - WE WILL REVOLUTIONISE THE MANAGEMENT OF COUNCIL HOUSES AND FLATS. COMPULSORY COMPETITIVE TENDERING WILL OBLIGE LOCAL AUTHORITIES TO BRING IN MANAGERS WHO DEMONSTRATE THEIR ABILITY TO DELIVER THE BEST SERVICES TO TENANTS.  - WE WILL CONTINUE OUR PROGRAMME OF LARGE SCALE VOLUNTARY TRANSFER OF COUNCIL PROPERTIES TO HOUSING ASSOCIATIONS. BUT IN ORDER TO BRING MANAGEMENT CLOSER TO TENANTS, WE INTEND TO REDUCE THE LIMIT ON THE NUMBER OF PROPERTIES TRANSFERRED IN A SINGLE BATCH.  - WE WILL GIVE TENANTS A NEW RIGHT TO IMPROVE, SO THEY CAN RECEIVE COMPENSATION FOR CERTAIN HOME IMPROVEMENTS WHICH THEY UNDERTAKE. AND WE WILL IMPROVE THE EXISTING RIGHT TO REPAIR. WE WILL CONTINUE OUR ESTATE ACTION AND HOUSING ACTION TRUST PROGRAMMES WHICH CONCENTRATE RESOURCES ON THE WORST COUNCIL ESTATES.  - WE WILL ENABLE TENANTS TO APPLY FOR HOUSING ACTION TRUSTS TO TAKE OVER AND IMPROVE THE WORST ESTATES.  - WE WILL WORK WITH THE HOUSING CORPORATION TO ESTABLISH A NEW OMBUDSMAN FOR HOUSING ASSOCIATION TENANTS. WE WILL ALSO ENCOURAGE THE CORPORATION TO EXTEND OPPORTUNITIES FOR TENANT INVOLVEMENT IN THE MANAGEMENT OF HOUSING ASSOCIATION PROPERTIES.  - WE WILL SET UP A TASK FORCE - HEADED BY AN INDEPENDENT CHAIRMAN - TO HELP BRING EMPTY GOVERNMENT RESIDENTIAL PROPERTIES BACK INTO USE. THESE WILL EITHER BE SOLD OR LET ON SHORT TERM LEASES TO THOSE IN HOUSING NEED.  - AS PART OF ESTATE ACTION WE WILL INTRODUCE A NEW PILOT SCHEME TO PROMOTE HOMESTEADING. LOCAL AUTHORITIES WILL BE ENCOURAGED TO OFFER THOSE IN HOUSING NEED THE OPPORTUNITY TO RESTORE AND IMPROVE COUNCIL PROPERTIES. IN EXCHANGE, HOMESTEADERS WILL PAY A LOWER RENT OR BE ABLE TO BUY AT A REDUCED PRICE.  TRANSPORT  Under the Conservatives, transport in Britain is being transformed. More competition on the roads and in the air has led to better services and more choice. Our successful policies of deregulation and privatisation have gone hand in hand with a sustained and growing programme of investment. Over 1,000 miles of new trunk roads and motorway have been built, more than 100 bypasses constructed, and some 750 miles of railway electrified. Airlines now operate 50 per cent more flights. More people travel further and more easily than ever before.  Over the next three years we are committed to the biggest investment in Britain's transport infrastructure in our history  We will also seek further opportunities for the private sector to contribute, as it has for example with the Channel Tunnel, the Queen Elizabeth II Bridge at Dartford, the second Severn Bridge and the Birmingham Northern Ring Road. We intend the proposed new rail link from the Channel Tunnel to King's Cross to be taken forward by the private sector.  THE RAILWAYS  We believe that the railways can play a bigger part in responding to Britain's growing transport needs, and are investing accordingly Next year alone, British Rail's external finance will top £2,000 million. The new Passenger's Charter will help to raise the quality of service. For the first time ever performance targets will be set, widely published and rigorously monitored; fare levels will reflect the standards set; and discounts will be paid to regular travellers where performance targets are not met.  We believe that the best way to produce profound and lasting improvements on the railways is to end BR's state monopoly We want to restore the pride and local commitment that died with nationalisation. We want to give the private sector the opportunity to operate existing rail services and introduce new ones, for both passengers and freight.  A significant number of companies have already said that they want to introduce new railway services as soon as the monopoly is ended. We will give them that chance.  Our plans for the railways are designed to bring better services for all passengers as rapidly as possible. We believe that franchising provides the best way of achieving that. Long term, as performance improves and services become more commercially attractive as a result of bringing in private sector disciplines, it will make sense to consider whether some services can be sold outright.  IN THE NEXT PARLIAMENT:  - BY FRANCHISING, WE WILL GIVE THE PRIVATE SECTOR THE FULLEST OPPORTUNITY TO OPERATE EXISTING PASSENGER RAILWAY SERVICES.  - REQUIRED STANDARDS OF PUNCTUALITY, RELIABILITY AND QUALITY OF SERVICE WILL BE SPECIFIED BY FRANCHISES; SUBSIDY WILL CONTINUE TO BE PROVIDED WHERE NECESSARY; ARRANGEMENTS TO SUSTAIN THE CURRENT NATIONAL NETWORK OF SERVICES WILL BE MAINTAINED; AND THROUGH-TICKETING WILL BE REQUIRED.  - A NEW RAIL REGULATOR - WHO WILL ENSURE THAT ALL COMPANIES HAVE FAIR ACCESS TO THE TRACK - WILL AWARD THE FRANCHISES AND MAKE SURE THAT THE FRANCHISEES HONOUR THE TERMS OF THE CONTRACT.  - BR'S ACCOUNTING SYSTEMS AND INTERNAL STRUCTURES WILL BE REORGANISED. ONE PART OF BR WILL CONTINUE TO BE RESPONSIBLE FOR ALL TRACK AND INFRASTRUCTURE. THE OPERATING SIDE OF BR WILL CONTINUE TO PROVIDE PASSENGER SERVICES UNTIL THEY ARE FRANCHISED OUT TO THE PRIVATE SECTOR.  - THE FRANCHISE AREAS WILL BE DECIDED ONLY AFTER TECHNICAL DISCUSSIONS WITH BR. BUT OUR AIM WILL BE TO FRANCHISE OUT SERVICES IN SUCH A WAY AS TO REFLECT REGIONAL AND LOCAL IDENTITY AND MAKE OPERATING SENSE. WE WANT TO RECOVER A SENSE OF PRIDE IN OUR RAILWAYS AND TO RECAPTURE THE SPIRIT OF THE OLD REGIONAL COMPANIES.  - WE WILL SELL BR'S FREIGHT OPERATIONS OUTRIGHT. WE WILL ALSO SELL ITS PARCELS BUSINESS.  - WE WILL BE PREPARED TO SELL STATIONS - WHICH WE WANT TO BE CENTRES OF ACTIVITY - EITHER TO FRANCHISEES OR INDEPENDENT COMPANIES.  - THE RAILWAY INSPECTORATE WILL BE GIVEN FULL POWERS TO ENSURE THE HIGHEST STANDARDS OF SAFETY.  ROADS  Nine out of every ten journeys, whether passenger or freight, are made by road. We must therefore continue to provide an efficient road network. In the years ahead we will concentrate particularly on the bypass programme.  As part of the Citizen's Charter, we will bring forward reforms which will enable the private sector to start filling the gaps in the motorway service area network and to introduce more variety Rather than large, intrusive stations at long intervals we should see smaller, more frequent service areas providing a much wider range of facilities.  We will investigate ways of speeding up, within the Department of Transport, the procedures for building new roads. We will continue our campaign to keep 'coning off' on motorways to a minimum by extending lane rental schemes, under which contractors who fall behind schedule incur financial penalties. Next year two-thirds of all motorway maintenance work will be carried out in this way.  Britain has the best road safety record in the European Community In spite of the vastly increased volume of traffic, fewer people are now killed on our roads than at any time since 1948. Our aim is to improve on that record still further.  In spite of the benefits they bring, cars carry an environmental cost. In Britain catalytic converters will be compulsory on all new cars from the end of 1992. This will eliminate virtually all harmful exhaust gases, except for the emission of CO2. The only certain way of cutting CO2 emissions is to encourage fuel efficiency. Action is needed at international level and we will play our full part.  Buses have an increasingly important part to play The deregulation of long-distance coach services has led to a major expansion in reliable and cheap services. Bus deregulation outside London has increased mileage by 16 per cent. We now propose to take deregulation and privatisation further.  WE WILL IMPROVE ROAD TRANSPORT BY:  - INVESTING £6,300 MILLION IN OUR TRUNK ROAD AND MOTORWAY NETWORK OVER THE NEXT THREE YEARS, CONCENTRATING PARTICULARLY ON BYPASSES. SOME 40 NEW ONES WILL BE OPENED BY 1993 ON TRUNK ROADS ALONE.  - INCREASING PENALTIES FOR THOSE CONVICTED OF DRINK DRIVING.  - INSTALLING CAMERAS AT DANGEROUS ROAD JUNCTIONS TO FILM THOSE WHO DRIVE THROUGH RED TRAFFIC LIGHTS.  - ENCOURAGING LOCAL COUNCILS, ASSISTED BY A SPECIAL BUDGET WE HAVE SET ASIDE, TO INTRODUCE PEDESTRIAN PRIORITY AREAS AND CYCLE LANES.  - PRIVATISING THE REMAINING 39 LOCAL AUTHORITY BUS COMPANIES.  - DEREGULATING BUSES IN LONDON AND PRIVATISING THE LONDON BUSES SUBSIDIARIES. A NEW LONDON BUS EXECUTIVE WILL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR BUS- STOPS, STANDS AND STATIONS AND FOR CONTRACTING OUT SOCIALLY NECESSARY SERVICES. THE CONCESSIONARY FARES SCHEME IN LONDON WILL CONTINUE.  - CHANGING THE SYSTEM UNDER WHICH MOTORWAY SERVICE AREAS ARE PROVIDED.  - ENCOURAGING ACTION INTERNATIONALLY, AND WITHIN OUR OWN MOTOR INDUSTRY, TO PROMOTE MORE FUEL-EFFICIENT VEHICLES.  AVIATION AND SHIPPING  More competition in aviation means more choice, better services and lower fares. That is why we have been pressing within the EC for full liberalisation of services. We also want to see more transatlantic flights, particularly to regional airports. People in the regions should not have to travel to London in order to fly to the United States. Direct flights would boost local economies and apply downward pressure on fares. The key regional airports are still in local authority ownership. They should be well placed to benefit from an increase in the number of direct point-to-point flights. But if they are really to grow and prosper, they need access to private capital, freed from the constraints of public ownership.  Air safety cannot be compromised. Over the next five years the Civil Aviation Authority will. invest £750 million in modernising its systems.  More can be done to cut some of the regulatory burdens our shipping industry faces. We will ensure that the recommendations of the Government Industry Joint Working Party are put into effect as rapidly as possible.  - WE WILL FURTHER LIBERALISE TRANSATLANTIC AIR SERVICES AND ENCOURAGE MORE INTERNATIONAL FLIGHTS TO AND FROM REGIONAL AIRPORTS.  - WE WILL ENCOURAGE LOCAL AUTHORITIES TO SELL THEIR AIRPORTS.  - WE WILL REDUCE AIRPORT CONGESTION BY INCREASING THE CAPACITY OF OUR AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL  - WE WILL CONTINUE TO CAMPAIGN WITHIN THE EC FOR FURTHER LIBERALISATION, PARTICULARLY OF CABOTAGE, SO THAT THERE ARE MORE COMMERCIAL OPPORTUNITIES FOR BRITISH COMPANIES.  LONDON'S TRANSPORT  A major programme of renewal and modernisation is transforming public transport in London - including the biggest expansion of London's rail network since the 1930s.  The £750 million upgrading of the Central Line is already under way, to be followed by a similar programme on the Northern Line; the Jubilee Line extension and Crossrail will follow.  London Underground is planning to invest £3,500 million over the next three years. It has introduced an ambitious Company Plan which will lead to better service, cleaner trains and more staff at stations and on platforms. Their new Charter will be published shortly  Responsibility for the Docklands Light Railway has been transferred to the London Docklands Development Corporation. As its performance continues to improve, we expect to see growing private sector interest in purchasing it outright.  - WE WILL SEEK TO PRIVATISE THE DOCKLANDS LIGHT RAILWAY DURING THE LIFETIME OF THE NEXT PARLIAMENT.  - THE NEW JUBILEE LINE IS BEING EXTENDED TO DOCKLANDS AND SOUTH EAST LONDON AND WILL BE FOLLOWED BY THE EAST-WEST CROSSRAIL, LINKING PADDINGTON TO LIVERPOOL STREET. THE DOCKLANDS LIGHT RAILWAY IS BEING EXTENDED AT AN EVENTUAL COST OF £800 MILLION.  - LONDON UNDERGROUND'S CHARTER WILL SET OUT TOUGHER NEW STANDARDS AND WHAT IT WILL DO TO COMPENSATE PASSENGERS SHOULD IT FAIL TO MEET THOSE STANDARDS.  LOCAL GOVERNMENT  Local councillors - some 25,000 men and women throughout Britain - are responsible for some of our most important public services. Since 1979 we have sought to create an accountable local government system capable of delivering high quality local services at a price that local people are prepared to pay.  Conservatives councils in shires, districts and cities have been at the forefront of these reforms. In a responsive and efficient manner, they have demonstrated how to deliver good services at an affordable price.  Over the past 13 years, we have:  - held down unjustified rises in the cost of local government;  - abolished the power of local councils to shift the burden of taxation on to local business, for the first time limiting the overall rise in business rates to no more than the rate of inflation;  - abolished an expensive and bureaucratic layer of government in London and other big cities;  - developed the local authority role from direct provider to effective enabler, encouraging many tenants to buy their own homes, allowing schools the freedom to manage their own affairs and improving the quality of local services by allowing private business to compete for contracts.  Labour threaten all these reforms. They would 'uncap' local spending, leading to higher local and national taxes. They would 'uncap' business rates, threatening a return to the 1980s when the English rate poundage rose 37 per cent more than inflation. They would abolish the requirement on local authorities to seek value for money through competitive tendering. They would remove the freedom of local communities to preserve their grammar schools. They would introduce a new; expensive layer of government bureaucracy at regional level. They would return local government finance to the bad old days of domestic rates, with unrestrained power for local councils to charge householders as much as they like. And they would abolish the Audit Commission, which not only maintains the probity of local government accounting, but also pioneered the drive for better quality of service and value for money in local government.  We now propose further reforms in the structure, finance and accountability of local government. In the meantime, we have transferred a further share of the burden of financing local services to central government. Today, local community chargepayers bear only a small proportion of the cost of local councils.  - WE WILL SET UP A COMMISSION TO EXAMINE, AREA BY AREA, THE APPROPRIATE LOCAL GOVERNMENT ARRANGEMENTS IN ENGLAND. LOCAL COMMUNITIES WILL BE FULLY CONSULTED AND THEIR LOYALTIES AND INTERESTS WILL BE CENTRAL TO THE COMMISSION S TASK IN DECIDING WHETHER IN ANY AREA A SINGLE TIER OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT COULD PROVIDE BETTER ACCOUNTABILITY AND GREATER EFFICIENCY.  - WE ARE LOOKING AT WAYS IN WHICH THE INTERNAL MANAGEMENT OF LOCAL AUTHORITIES MIGHT BECOME MORE EFFECTIVE.  - WE ARE APPLYING THE PRINCIPLES OF THE CITIZEN'S CHARTER TO LOCAL GOVERNMENT, REQUIRING THE PUBLICATION OF MORE INFORMATION WHICH WILL ENABLE LOCAL PEOPLE TO JUDGE THE EFFICIENCY OF THEIR COUNCILS IN PROVIDING SERVICES.  - WE WILL CONTINUE TO 'CAP' LOCAL SPENDING WHERE NECESSARY.  - AS WE ANNOUNCED IN THE BUDGET, NO ONE'S UNIFORM BUSINESS RATE WILL GO UP THIS YEAR BY MORE THAN THE RATE OF INFLATION 4.1 PER CENT. AND WE HAVE SPEEDED UP THE BENEFITS OF REVALUATION FOR THOSE BUSINESSES WHO GAIN FROM IT.  - IN FUTURE YEARS, WE WILL MAINTAIN OUR PLEDGE TO PREVENT UBR POUNDAGE RISING BY MORE THAN INFLATION.  - WE WILL REPLACE THE COMMUNITY CHARGE WITH A NEW COUNCIL TAX IN APRIL 1993. THE COUNCIL TAX WILL BE SIMPLE AND STRAIGHTFORWARD TO ADMINISTER. IT WILL BE FAIR AND WILL RIGHTLY REFLECT BOTH THE VALUE OF THE PROPERTY AND THE NUMBER OF ADULTS WHO LIVE IN IT.  - SINGLE HOUSEHOLDERS, WHO SUFFERED UNDER THE RATES, WILL RECEIVE A 25 PER CENT DISCOUNT. BY GROUPING PROPERTIES INTO A LIMITED NUMBER OF BANDS, THE COUNCIL TAX ALSO AVOIDS THE PUNITIVE BILLS WHICH WOULD BE IMPOSED BY AN UNFETTERED RATING SYSTEM OF THE KIND PROPOSED BY LABOUR. STUDENTS AND PEOPLE ON LOW INCOMES WILL NOT HAVE TO PAY.  CITIES  We take pride in our cities. Right across Britain they have been given a new lease of life. From London to Glasgow; from Cardiff to Newcastle, historic buildings have been restored and areas which had been run down have been transformed. The £4,000 million Action for Cities programme underlines the Conservative commitment to our inner cities and the people who live there. It highlights our determination to spread opportunity as widely as possible. We want all our people to share in growing prosperity and to have a stake in the country's future. Much has been achieved in recent years. The Urban Development Corporations and the wide range of central government grants have helped to regenerate many of our inner city areas. But more remains to be done.  The best way to restore the spirit of enterprise which first made our cities great is for local people, the private sector, the voluntary sector and local and central government, to work together in partnership. That is the principle which lies behind City Challenge. Its new approach of competitive bidding has already galvanized towns and cities into bringing forward imaginative proposals for regeneration. It has improved co-ordination, secured better value for money and encouraged programmes which tackle problems on a number of fronts.  - WE WILL CONTINUE TO EXTEND CITY CHALLENGE AND ALLOCATE A GREATER PROPORTION OF RESOURCES BY COMPETITIVE BIDDING.  - WE WILL SUPPORT URBAN DEVELOPMENT CORPORATIONS IN THEIR CRITICAL TASK OF URBAN REGENERATION.  - WE WILL BRING TOGETHER RESOURCES TARGETED INNER CITY PROGRAMMES INTO A SINGLE BUDGET. THIS WILL MEAN THAT FUNDING WILL GO WHERE IT IS MOST NEEDED LOCALLY RATHER THAN ACCORDING TO A SET OF PRIORITIES DETERMINED IN WHITEHALL.  - WE WILL STRENGTHEN THE MACHINERY FOR CO ORDINATION IN THE REGIONS. NEW, INTEGRATED REGIONAL OFFICES OF THE APPROPRIATE WHITEHALL DEPARTMENTS WILL BE ESTABLISHED SO THAT BUSINESS AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT WILL HAVE ONLY ONE PORT OF CALL.  - WE WILL ESTABLISH A NEW URBAN REGENERATION AGENCY TO PULL TOGETHER OUR EFFORTS TO CLEAR UP AND DEVELOP DERELICT LAND, HELPING TO BRING IT BACK INTO COMMERCIAL USE AND PROVIDE NEW OPPORTUNITIES FOR LOCAL PEOPLE.  Working in the urban areas, the URA will administer much of the Urban programme of the Department of the Environment. It will have a dual function. First, outside the existing UDC areas, it will reclaim derelict land, assembling suitable sites for redevelopment using vesting or compulsory purchase powers where necessary Second, it will itself be able to develop land in partnership with the private sector. This represents a major step forward in unlocking the commercial potential of our inner cities and of breathing new life into areas which may have been derelict for many years.  But our focus is not just on physical regeneration. We want to see more opportunities for training, more encouragement to enterprise, better education and more measures to tackle drugs and crime.  Encouraging enterprise, improving the environment and providing new opportunities for the unemployed are central to our inner city policies. Remotivating individuals and providing the right conditions for business are the only ways to make lasting change.  - WE WILL OFFER THE LOAN GUARANTEE SCHEME FOR SMALL FIRMS ON MORE GENEROUS TERMS IN INNER CITY AREAS. THE SCHEME WILL BE EXTENDED FROM TASK FORCE AREAS TO INCLUDE SUCCESSFUL CITY CHALLENGE BIDDERS.  - WE WILL MAKE MORE PEOPLE ELIGIBLE FOR OUR SUCCESSFUL JOB INTERVIEW GUARANTEE SCHEME, WHICH LINKS UNEMPLOYED PEOPLE WITH LOCAL LOBS.  - WE WILL CARRY OUT PILOT PROJECTS FOR THE 'FOYER' CONCEPT, WHEREBY YOUNG PEOPLE ARE GIVEN A PLACE IN A HOSTEL IF IN EXCHANGE THEY GIVE A COMMITMENT TO TRAIN AND LOOK FOR WORK.  - WE WILL PILOT A NUMBER OF 'BACK TO WORK' BONUS SCHEMES IN INNER CITY AREAS FOR THE LONG-TERM UNEMPLOYED.  - WE WILL EXTEND CUSTOMISED TRAINING UNDER THE JOB LINK PROGRAMME TO INCLUDE CITY CHALLENGE AREAS.  - WE WILL MAKE INNER CITY TASK FORCE AND CITY CHALLENGE AREAS ELIGIBLE FOR REGIONAL INNOVATION GRANTS.  We are also determined to raise standards in our inner city schools, to crack down on truancy, and to help prepare young people for the world of work.  The City Technology Colleges show what can be done. They are overwhelmingly popular with parents and pupils and are doing much to raise standards for children of all abilities in the inner cities.  Under the Citizen's Charter, we shall soon be able to identify much more precisely than ever before those schools which are delivering unacceptably low standards. So will parents. We will publish test results, exam results and truancy rates and ensure that there is regular independent inspection. This will enable us to put the spotlight on those inner city LEAs and schools which are failing their pupils.  - WE WILL CONTINUE TO SEEK OPPORTUNITIES TO OPEN NEW CTCS IN DEPRIVED INNER CITY AREAS.  - WE WILL ENSURE THAT MORE SCHOOLS, ESPECIALLY IN THE INNER CITIES, HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO DEVELOP THEIR TECHNOLOGICAL EXPERTISE.  Tackling crime and the fear of crime forms a vital part of the strategy to make our inner cities better places to live and work. The Safer Cities initiative, launched in 1988, has successfully brought together local groups and agencies to tackle crime in some of our worst affected urban areas. Twenty schemes are already in operation.  - WE WILL DOUBLE THE NUMBER OF SAFER CITIES SCHEMES TO COVER 40 URBAN AREAS.  LONDON  London is a magnet to visitors and business from across the world. Since 1979 we have invested heavily to secure that status. Billions of pounds have gone into improving air, rail and underground links. We will continue that programme of modernisation. We are determined to sustain into the next century London's special position as one of the world's leading capital cities. We reject Labour's plan to recreate a bureaucratic and wasteful GLC. Instead, as part of our Millennium programme, we will launch a London 2000 initiative. The Secretary of State for the Environment will convene a new private sector forum to promote London internationally as a business, tourist and cultural centre. The Secretary of State will also chair a new Cabinet sub-committee to bring together Ministers from all key departments and co-ordinate policy for the further improvement of London. A single Minister will be given responsibility for co-ordinating London's transport services. London's place as a world centre for financial and insurance services is pre-eminent; we intend to keep it that way And we will support the vigorous cultural life of the capital, which has seen new galleries, theatres and museums opening over the last decade.  - WE WILL LAUNCH A LONDON 2000 INITIATIVE.  - WE WILL CONVENE A NEW PRIVATE SECTOR FORUM TO PROMOTE LONDON'S POSITION INTERNATIONALLY.  - WE WILL ESTABLISH A NEW CABINET SUB COMMITTEE TO CO-ORDINATE POLICY ON LONDON.  - WE WILL GIVE A SINGLE TRANSPORT MINISTER RESPONSIBILITY FOR SERVICES IN LONDON. HE WILL CHAIR A NEW TRANSPORT WORKING GROUP WHICH WILL BRING TOGETHER PUBLIC TRANSPORT OPERATORS FROM BOTH PUBLIC AND PRIVATE SECTORS - TO DISCUSS TRANSPORT ISSUES IN LONDON.  THE COUNTRYSIDE  We have always cared for the countryside. We support its major industries and way of life, while recognising the place it holds in the hearts of those who live in towns.  We want to protect our most beautiful landscapes, conserve the abundance and variety of our wildlife and habitats, promote access and public enjoyment of the countryside, and encourage public participation in caring for the countryside.  But the countryside is more than just a pretty picture. It is a place where people live and work, as they have done in the past and will do in the future. In providing our public services, we will continue to recognise the particular needs of people who live in the countryside.  - WE WILL CONTINUE TO PROMOTE A DIVERSE RURAL ECONOMY, BALANCING THE NEED FOR JOBS, HOUSING AND SERVICES IN RURAL AREAS WITH PROTECTION OF THE RURAL ENVIRONMENT.  AGRICULTURE  Centuries of farming have shaped our countryside. Now farming is at a crossroads, both here and in the rest of the European Community World-wide pressure to reduce protectionist measures, and the need to contain the cost of the Common Agricultural Policy, mean that farmers will face reduced support and increased competition.  We believe that farming in the UK can meet these challenges. But many farmers will need help to adapt to the new conditions, and we will continue to provide assistance.  It will become increasingly important for farmers to obtain a greater proportion of their income from the market. We will encourage farmers, retailers and manufacturers to work together to increase our share of the European food market.  We are committed to reducing the burden of regulation on business in general, and farming in particular. We will not accept UK farmers being put at a disadvantage by EC laws being applied differently in other countries.  Responsible farmers have always combined efficient farming with care for the countryside. We will continue to encourage this approach through schemes to protect landscape and habitats of special importance. We will also maintain direct support for farming in the Less Favoured Areas in ways which encourage good environmental practice  - WE WILL SEEK A REFORM OF THE CAP WHICH BRINGS AGRICULTURE CLOSER TO THE MARKET; REDUCES THE COSTS TO TAXPAYERS AND CONSUMERS; IS IMPLEMENTED AT A PACE WHICH THE INDUSTRY CAN BEAR; AFFECTS ALL COMMUNITY FARMERS EQUITABLY, REGARDLESS OF SIZE OR LOCATION; AND RECOGNISES THE IMPORTANCE OF ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION.  - WE WILL BUILD ON THE PRODUCER MARKETING INITIATIVES WHICH WE HAVE ALREADY LAUNCHED, INCLUDING THE GROUP MARKETING GRANT.  - WE WILL ASSIST THE MILK MARKETING BOARD'S MOVE TO A NEW STRUCTURE WHICH WILL BE BETTER ABLE TO PROTECT THE INTERESTS OF PRODUCERS AND CONSUMERS IN THE SINGLE MARKET.  - WE WILL PUBLISH TARGET RESPONSE TIMES FOR GRANT AND LICENCE APPLICATIONS MADE TO THE MINISTRY OF AGRICULTURE.  - WE WILL TAKE FORWARD PROPOSALS FOR RADICAL LIBERALISATION OF THE AGRICULTURAL TENANCY LAWS IN ORDER TO MAKE MORE LAND AVAILABLE FOR RENT, ESPECIALLY FOR NEW ENTRANTS.  - WE WILL ENFORCE EFFECTIVE POLLUTION CONTROL REGULATIONS WHILE HELPING FARMERS TO MEET THE HIGH STANDARDS REQUIRED.  - WE WILL PRESS FOR AN AGREEMENT IN THE EC'S AGRICULTURAL COUNCIL WHICH WILL ALLOW US TO PROVIDE FINANCIAL ENCOURAGEMENT FOR ORGANIC AGRICULTURE.  FORESTRY  Forestry is a traditional rural industry, which also affects the landscape, and gives pleasure to millions of people. The needs of a successful industry, landscape conservation, and public access must all be accommodated; and we will reorganise the Forestry Commission to reflect these objectives more effectively.  - WE WILL PLANT A NEW NATIONAL FOREST IN THE MIDLANDS AND COMMUNITY FORESTS ELSEWHERE.  - WE WILL REVIEW THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE CURRENT INCENTIVES FOR FORESTRY INVESTMENT.  - WE WILL PRODUCE GUIDANCE ON THE PREPARATION OF LOCAL INDICATIVE FORESTRY STRATEGIES DESIGNED TO ENCOURAGE NEW WOODLANDS, WHILE STEERING PLANTING AWAY FROM SENSITIVE AREAS.  FISHING  Fishing is a vital industry in many parts of our islands. Many fishermen have done well in recent years but they now face great pressure on the fish stocks. This means that fishing quotas are likely to fall in coming years in order to preserve the long-term future of the fisheries. We will continue to work for the profitable and sustainable future of our fishing fleet.  - We are determined to see that the renegotiation of the Common Fisheries Policy protects the interests of UK fishermen and retains our share of the Community's fishing opportunities.  - We will introduce a balanced package of measures, including decommissioning and controls on fishing activity, to conserve fish and safeguard the future of the industry.  RURAL JOBS AND SERVICES  Changes in agriculture and other traditional industries will affect employment opportunities in the countryside. We will continue to target help through the Rural Development Commission, and ask the RDC to review the Rural Development Areas to ensure that its efforts are targeted on the areas of most need. We are committed to developing tourism in ways which provide all-year-round jobs and bring benefit to less well-known parts of our countryside, without damaging the environment. We have recently published new planning policy guidance which makes it clear how the countryside can benefit from new businesses and jobs, if the location and design of development are handled with sensitivity  In local government, many of our shire counties and districts have led the way in raising the quality of public service. Local post offices, local transport and local schools all have an important role to play in sustaining rural life.  - WE WILL CONSULT ON OUR RECENTLY PUBLISHED DRAFT PLANNING POLICY GUIDANCE DESIGNED TO PROVIDE A CLEAR FRAMEWORK FOR DECISIONS ON DEVELOPMENTS TO AID TOURISM.  - WE WILL WIDEN THE AVAILABILITY OF THE RURAL DEVELOPMENT COMMISSION'S SUCCESSFUL REDUNDANT BUILDINGS GRANT SCHEME, AND STRENGTHEN OTHER RDC PROGRAMMES.  - WE WILL MAINTAIN OUR SPECIAL PROGRAMMES TO PROMOTE AFFORDABLE HOMES IN RURAL AREAS.  - WE ARE FULLY COMMITTED TO MAINTAINING A NATIONAL NETWORK OF POST OFFICES.  - WE WILL CONTINUE TO ASSIST LOCAL AUTHORITIES WHO WANT TO SUBSIDISE RURAL TRANSPORT.  - WE WILL ENABLE VILLAGE SCHOOLS THAT WISH TO APPLY FOR GRANT-MAINTAINED STATUS TO DO SO IN SMALL GROUPS, THUS ENABLING THEM TO SHARE MANAGEMENT TASKS WHILE STILL ENJOYING THE BENEFITS OF INDEPENDENCE.  - THE EXPANSION OF GP FUND-HOLDING WILL BRING PARTICULAR BENEFITS TO RURAL AREAS BECAUSE OF THE CONVENIENCE OF DIFFERENT SERVICES - SUCH AS PHYSIOTHERAPY AND CONSULTANT APPOINTMENTS - BEING OFFERED IN THE GP'S SURGERY.  CARING FOR THE COUNTRYSIDE  Some of our finest landscapes are designated as National Parks. All National Park authorities will become independent Boards, which will make it easier for them to carry out their tasks effectively The New Forest will be given a statutory status which will give it as great a level of protection as any National Park.  Last summer the Government launched an experiment in Countryside Stewardship'. This aims to conserve, enhance and re-create fine landscapes so that they may be enjoyed and appreciated by the public. The response from farmers, landowners and environmental bodies has been very positive. We therefore propose to expand the scheme and to introduce a new scheme to preserve hedgerows - a much valued feature of the English landscape, and a haven for wildlife.  The Government endorsed and supported the Countryside Commission's target designed to bring 120,000 miles of rights of way into good order by the end of the century.  At parish level, individuals can work together either to safeguard the character of their local village, or to improve its appearance. Local action can also preserve local wildlife and habitats. Under the Rural Environmental Action Scheme, grants of up to £2,000 per project will be available to support local environmental action.  The Government is keen to promote the fullest possible use of inland waterways for leisure, recreation and amenity, in the regeneration of inner cities and for freight transport where appropriate. But we recognise that the various uses of canals and rivers must be properly managed to protect the character and environment of the waterways.  - WE WILL EXPAND THE COUNTRYSIDE STEWARDSHIP SCHEME TO COVER THE CONSERVATION OF HISTORIC LANDSCAPES, MEADOWS, PASTURE AND HEDGEROWS. PUBLIC ACCESS TO QUALIFYING SCHEMES WILL BE ENCOURAGED.  - WE WILL INTRODUCE A HEDGEROW INCENTIVE SCHEME TO HELP PRESERVE HEDGEROWS OF PARTICULAR HISTORIC, LANDSCAPE OR WILDLIFE IMPORTANCE.  - WE WILL CONTRIBUTE TO THE COUNTRYSIDE COMMISSION'S NEW PARISH PATH PARTNERSHIP DESIGNED TO STIMULATE LOCAL MAINTENANCE AND IMPROVEMENT SCHEMES.  - WE WILL CONTINUE TO SUPPORT THE DEVELOPMENT AND REDEVELOPMENT OF OUR CANALS, AS WELL AS ENHANCING THE ENVIRONMENTAL STANDARDS OF OUR WATERWAYS.  THE ENVIRONMENT  The Conservative Party's commitment to the environment is beyond doubt. Other parties promise the earth. We have taken action - both nationally and internationally - to preserve it.  Environmental protection can impose financial costs on producers, consumers and taxpayers, so we must make sure the threat of damage is a real one. But we also accept the precautionary principle - the need to act, where there is significant risk of damage, before the scientific evidence is conclusive. And we recognise that higher environmental standards can offer new opportunities for business.  We published the first comprehensive White Paper on the Environment in 1990. It covered everything from the stratosphere to the street corner. We will continue to publish annual progress reports.  This Conservative Government has taken a lead in working to protect the ozone layer. We will strive to accelerate the eradication of ozone depleting substances.  One of the most important issues facing all countries is the threat of global warming. Effective action to combat global warming must be international action. Again we have taken a lead. The Prime Minister was the first world leader to announce his intention to attend the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro this June. We have said that we will consider stabilising our CO2 emissions earlier than our existing conditional target of 2005. We have promised to provide new and additional resources to help the developing countries to tackle their environmental problems.  Within Britain, and ahead of other European countries, we have introduced the concept of integrated pollution control.  We have set up, for the first time, powerful co-ordinating machinery within Whitehall to ensure that environmental considerations are given due weight in all decision-making.  We are committed to openness on environmental matters. We support the establishment of a European Environment Agency to provide a Europe-wide environmental database. We believe that the public should have access to information held by the pollution control authorities. Public registers are now provided by bodies such as the National Rivers Authority and Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Pollution.  - WE WILL ESTABLISH A NEW ENVIRONMENT AGENCY WHICH WILL BRING TOGETHER THE FUNCTIONS OF THE NATIONAL RIVERS AUTHORITY, HER MAJESTY'S INSPECTORATE OF POLLUTION AND THE WASTE REGULATION FUNCTIONS OF LOCAL AUTHORITIES.  - THE NEW EA WILL HAVE A STATUTORY DUTY TO PUBLISH AN ANNUAL STATE OF THE ENVIRONMENT REPORT.  - WITHIN THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITY WE WILL PRESS FOR THE INTRODUCTION OF INTEGRATED POLLUTION CONTROL ON THE UK MODEL.  TOWARDS THE MILLENNIUM  A more prosperous Britain can afford to be ambitious. We can aspire to excellence in the arts, broadcasting and sport. We can use our increased leisure time, energy and money, to improve life for ourselves and our families. The National Lottery we propose to introduce can be used to restore our heritage and promote projects which will become a source of national pride.  National Lotteries have been found useful at several times in our history. The British Museum was founded out of the proceeds of such a lottery. Fourteen years ago, a Royal Commission recommended the creation of a National Lottery in Britain to provide extra money for deserving causes. The case has become even stronger as British people gain more opportunities to participate in foreign lotteries - thus increasing the risk that funds which we could put to good use in Britain will be diverted abroad.  We believe a well-run, carefully controlled form of national lottery would be popular, while raising money for many good causes.  We will canvass views on how such a lottery should be run and controlled, and how it would fit within the pattern of charitable fund-raising in Britain.  We believe that the funds generated by a National Lottery should be used to enhance the life of our nation. People who enjoy the arts, sport, Britain's heritage and fine countryside could all benefit from the proceeds from a National Lottery. Charities, right across the country and covering such areas as medical research, will also be potential beneficiaries.  THE MILLENNIUM FUND  We will be consulting widely on the best way to distribute the proceeds of a lottery. But we have decided that part of the proceeds should be put aside, year by year, into a Millennium Fund specifically dedicated to projects which will commemorate the start of the twenty-first century and will be enjoyed by future generations.  - WE THEREFORE PROPOSE TO INTRODUCE A NATIONAL LOTTERY FROM 1994, WHICH WOULD HELP PROVIDE FUNDS FOR A NUMBER OF GOOD CAUSES IN THE ARTISTIC, SPORTING, HERITAGE AND CHARITABLE FIELDS - AND FROM WHICH SOME FUNDS WOULD BE PUT ASIDE FOR A MILLENNIUM FUND.  The Millennium Fund could be used, for example:  - TO RESTORE THE FABRIC OF OUR NATION: OUR GREAT INHERITANCE OF BUILDINGS WHICH SYMBOLISE AND ENRICH OUR NATIONAL LIFE.  - TO HELP ENDOW OUR CITIES AND REGIONS WITH FACILITIES TO ENHANCE THE CELEBRATION OF UNITED KINGDOM 2000, SUCH AS THE SPORTING FACILITIES MANCHESTER WOULD NEED TO HOST THE 2000 OLYMPICS.  - TO HELP ANOTHER MAJOR CITY - CHOSEN BY COMPETITION - TO HOLD AN INTERNATIONAL TRADE FAIR DESIGNED TO BE A SHOWCASE OF BRITISH INNOVATION FOR THE TWENTY-FIRST CENTURY.  - TO ENABLE VOLUNTARY GROUPS AND LOCAL COMMUNITIES TO BID FOR FUNDING FOR THEIR OWN MILLENNIUM PROJECTS FOR LOCAL RESTORATION SCHEMES, OR FOR IMPROVING THE AMENITIES OF CANALS AND RIVERS, AS A SOURCE OF ENJOYMENT FOR LOCAL PEOPLE AND A HABITAT FOR WILDLIFE.  - TO PROVIDE MILLENNIUM BURSARIES FOR YOUNG PEOPLE (AND NEWLY RETIRED PEOPLE) OFFERING THEIR TIME, ENERGY AND COMMITMENT TO SCHEMES DESIGNED TO CHANGE THE FACE OF THE UNITED KINGDOM BY THE YEAR 2000.  THE ARTS  Britain has a great artistic heritage and a lively contemporary arts scene. The arts have flourished in recent years, with growing attendance at theatre, opera, dance and arts festivals.  We have supported this by increasing the public funding of the arts, by 60 per cent in real terms since 1979, and introducing new incentives to personal giving. The arts have also forged new partnerships with local authorities, businesses and private patrons. Business sponsorship in particular has expanded hugely.  We have set up new Regional Arts Boards and supported the Scottish and Welsh Arts Councils in order to diversify and enrich cultural life throughout the country.  We have financed the European Arts Festival to be held throughout Britain during our Presidency of the Community in the second half of this year, as well as the first National Music Day in June.  In this year's Budget, we announced further tax relief on film-making in this country. Our aim is to make the performing arts, museums and our heritage accessible to all. We will encourage the young to become involved and will facilitate access for the disabled.  - THE NATIONAL LOTTERY WILL PROVIDE A NEW SOURCE OF FINANCE FOR THE ARTS.  - WE WILL MAINTAIN SUPPORT FOR THE ARTS AND CONTINUE TO DEVELOP SCHEMES FOR GREATER SPONSORSHIP IN CO-OPERATION WITH BUSINESS AND PRIVATE INDIVIDUALS.  - WE WILL RE-EXAMINE THE ROLE OF THE ARTS COUNCIL, AS MANY OF ITS FUNCTIONS ARE NOW CARRIED OUT REGIONALLY.  - WE WILL CONTINUE OUR SUPPORT OF LIBRARIES AS EDUCATIONAL, CULTURAL AND COMMUNITY CENTRES, AND URGE LOCAL AUTHORITIES TO KEEP UP STANDARDS. WE WILL COMPLETE THE NEW BRITISH LIBRARY BUILDING FOR WHICH WE HAVE PROVIDED £450 MILLION.  SPORT  Success in sport is a source of national pride. Enjoyment of sport can enrich every life. We have given strong support to the Sports Council and its efforts to raise participation in sport. We actively support Manchester's bid to bring the Olympic Games to Britain.  We want to restore the good image of football. Tough action has cut down football hooliganism. We have helped to establish the Football Trust, which now devotes £20 million a year to improving the safety of grounds.  Under the National Curriculum all primary and secondary age pupils will follow a course of PE. All pupils will be taught to swim by the age of 11.  We will continue to encourage private sector sponsorship of sport. We will encourage more effective use of local sport and leisure facilities through compulsory competitive tendering. We want to see more dual use of school playing fields and halls and will give schools more freedom in their management.  We are asking Local Education Authorities not to make sales of school playing fields in future unless there is no evidence of long-term need.  - SPORT, TOO, WILL BENEFIT FROM THE RESOURCES GENERATED BY THE NATIONAL LOTTERY  - WE WILL ACTIVELY SUPPORT BRITAIN'S BID TO HOST THE 2000 OLYMPIC GAMES IN MANCHESTER. WE WILL PROVIDE £55 MILLION TOWARDS THE PREPARATION OF THE SITE AND KEY FACILITIES IN THE FIRST STAGE OF THE BID, AND WE WILL ENSURE THAT THE PROJECT, WHETHER SUCCESSFUL OR NOT, CONTRIBUTES TO THE EFFECTIVE REGENERATION OF EAST MANCHESTER.  - WE WILL SET UP A NEW BUSINESS SPONSORSHIP FOR SPORT SCHEME. THIS IS EXPECTED TO RAISE £6 MILLION IN ITS FIRST YEAR TO SUPPORT LOCAL AND YOUTH SPORT.  OUR HERITAGE  Public interest and involvement in Britain's heritage has never been greater. We have created in the past decade English Heritage and the National Heritage Memorial Fund to give greater focus and drive to the Government's policies. The National Trust and private owners take a leading part in preserving our almost unrivalled heritage. Government will work in partnership to secure our heritage for the benefit of future generations.  Our cathedrals are among our national glories. We therefore launched the Cathedral Repair Grant Scheme in April 1991, providing £11.5 million over three years.  We have increased, to £12 million, the grant to the NHMF for the purchase of historic properties, objects and collections. The Government also provides help to private owners through English Heritage repair grants, and tax relief in return for commitments on upkeep and public access.  We want to preserve the special character of our old town and city centres. We will encourage councils to ensure that new developments are in character with the past; to maintain buildings of importance to the character of towns and cities; to limit unnecessary street furniture and signs; and to plant trees and preserve historic patterns and open spaces.  - THE NATIONAL LOTTERY WILL ALSO PROVIDE FUNDS FOR THE PRESERVATION OF OUR HERITAGE.  - WE WILL CONTINUE TO PROVIDE SUBSTANTIAL FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE FOR THE PROTECTION AND PRESERVATION OF THE HERITAGE.  - TOGETHER WITH THE HERITAGE AGENCIES, WE WILL WORK TO MAKE HERITAGE SITES ACCESSIBLE TO THE PUBLIC.  BROADCASTING  We are proud of our record of extending choice, encouraging new producers and maintaining high standards in broadcasting. We opened the way to the setting-up of Channel 4, independent radio, satellite television and multi-channel cable TV networks. The 1990 Broadcasting Act means that three new independent radio services and a fifth television channel will be set up during the next Parliament.  Over two million homes already receive satellite TV We have now licensed well over a hundred cable TV networks and this new industry expects to invest £3,000 million over the next five years. In coming years, British viewers will have an increasing choice of channels and programmes. The new and sophisticated cable networks will open the way not only to new telecommunication services, but also to the spread of emerging technologies such as high definition television.  We attach great importance to the work of the Broadcasting Standards Council, which we set up under the 1990 Act. All television and radio companies accept the need to maintain standards of taste and decency in their treatment of sex and violence and their use of bad language.  The European Community regulates standards in satellite broadcasts originating from each Member State. We were one of the first countries to ratify a new Council of Europe convention applying similar rules to all its Member States. We also, in the Broadcasting Act, brought in sanctions against the transmission of offensive satellite broadcasts from abroad, and made it an offence for advertisers and equipment suppliers to support such programmes.  Independent television producers are benefiting from the requirement put on the BBC and ITV to commission a quarter of all their programmes, excluding the news, from outsiders. There are now great opportunities for independent producers to sell their programmes to new television channels and international markets, and there is much greater choice for viewers as a result.  In 1996, the BBC's Charter comes up for renewal. This will be considered against the background of the much more varied and competitive broadcasting environment which our policies have created. It is important that there should be a wide public debate about the future direction the BBC should take.  - WE WILL BACK THE WORK OF THE BROADCASTING STANDARDS COUNCIL AND REMAIN VIGILANT ABOUT ENSURING HIGH STANDARDS IN SATELLITE BROADCASTS FROM ABROAD.  - WE WILL PUBLISH A DISCUSSION PAPER ON THE FUTURE OF THE BBC RECOGNISING ITS SPECIAL RESPONSIBILITIES FOR PROVIDING PUBLIC SERVICE BROADCASTING.  A UNITED KINGDOM  The United Kingdom is far greater than the sum of its parts. Over many centuries its nations have worked, and frequently fought, side by side. Together, we have made a unique mark on history Together, we hold a special place in international affairs. To break up the Union now would diminish our influence for good in the world, just at the time when it is most needed.  Nationalist plans for independence are a recipe for weakness and isolation. Higher taxes and political uncertainty would deter investment and destroy jobs. The costly Labour and Liberal devolution proposals for Scotland and Wales have the same drawbacks. They do not intend to bring about separation, but run that risk. They could feed, but not resolve, grievances that arise in different parts of Britain. They would deprive Scotland and Wales of their rightful seats in the United Kingdom Cabinet, seats the Conservatives are determined to preserve. We believe strongly that we should go on working together in full partnership in a Union that has served every part of the United Kingdom well.  The plans for devolution put forward by the other parties would have a grave impact not just on Scotland and Wales, but also on England. They propose new and costly regional assemblies in England, for which there is no demand. We will oppose all such unnecessary layers of government.  The Union has brought us strength both economically and politically Yet it has preserved the historic and cultural diversity of our islands. Our constitution is flexible, fair and tolerant. It has made this country one of the best places in which to live, work and bring up our children. These benefits cannot be tossed away lightly We will fight to preserve the Union, a promise which only the Conservatives can give at this election.  SCOTLAND  Scotland has achieved an economic and cultural regeneration over the past 13 years. The Scottish economy has responded vigorously to the policies we have introduced to liberate enterprise, and many more people are now saving, investing and owning their homes. The public services are better funded and more efficient. There has been a flowering of Scottish culture.  Scotland enjoys a rich and distinct tradition and her own institutions, which we have preserved and strengthened. Scotland has its own framework for the encouragement of enterprise, investment and training; its own education system which continues to excel, with more pupils leaving school better qualified and more going on to further and higher education; its own health budgets which deliver high standards of care; and its own glorious inheritance of buildings and countryside.  A separate Manifesto for Scotland sets out our record in detail and our proposals for building on these achievements. In this document, therefore, we list only a selection.  - BUSINESS IN SCOTLAND HAS RECEIVED A BOOST FROM OUR CREATION OF SCOTTISH ENTERPRISE AND THE LOCAL ENTERPRISE COMPANIES. WE HAVE FORMED SCOTTISH TRADE INTERNATIONAL TO HELP OUR EXPORTERS, AS LOCATE IN SCOTLAND DOES FOR INWARD INVESTORS. TO ASSIST BUSINESS FURTHER, WE WILL COMPLETE THE HARMONISATION OF BUSINESS RATES IN SCOTLAND WITH THOSE IN THE REST OF THE COUNTRY.  - THE MASSIVE BUREAUCRACIES AND LAYERS OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT HAVE FEW SUPPORTERS IN SCOTLAND. WE WILL CONTINUE TO PRESS LOCAL AUTHORITIES TO PROVIDE THE VALUE FOR MONEY AND THE QUALITY OF SERVICES THAT PEOPLE EXPECT. WE WILL PRESS AHEAD WITH THE REFORM OF THE CURRENT BURDENSOME SYSTEM OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT BY INTRODUCING SINGLE TIER COUNCILS THROUGHOUT SCOTLAND.  - WE WILL CONTINUE TO STRENGTHEN SCOTLAND'S EDUCATION SYSTEM FOR THE BENEFIT OF PARENTS, PUPILS AND TEACHERS. WE WILL RESPOND TO THE PROPOSALS OF THE HOWIE COMMITTEE TO ENSURE THAT UPPER SECONDARY EDUCATION MATCHES THE BEST IN EUROPE. WE WILL CONTINUE TO INCREASE THE NUMBER OF PLACES IN HIGHER AND FURTHER EDUCATION AND WILL COMPLETE OUR REFORMS OF THE SYSTEM.  - WE WILL EXTEND OUR REFORMS TO IMPROVE NHS PATIENT CARE IN SCOTLAND. SCOTLAND HAS LED THE WAY IN SETTING LIMITS TO WAITING-TIMES FOR OPERATIONS AND WILL NOW BE REDUCING THESE FURTHER.  - WE ARE CREATING A NEW BODY, SCOTTISH NATURAL HERITAGE, WITH OVERALL RESPONSIBILITY FOR CONSERVING THE NATURAL ENVIRONMENT. WE WILL GO FURTHER, AND WILL CREATE A SCOTTISH ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY TO BRING TOGETHER POWERS TO ENSURE THE QUALITY OF OUR AIR, RIVERS AND BATHING WATERS.  WALES  Since 1979, the economy of Wales has changed spectacularly With only 5 per cent of the United Kingdom's population, Wales has consistently enjoyed 20 per cent of its inward investment. New industries have sprung up. Self-employment has risen by two-thirds. Welsh manufacturing now has the highest productivity of any part in the United Kingdom.  Land made derelict by old industries has been reclaimed on a massive scale. The Cardiff Bay development and the Ebbw Vale Garden Festival are outstanding examples, together with the Programme for the Valleys.  Since 1979, we have spent more than £3,000 million on roads in Wales. Spending on health has increased by 60 per cent in real terms since 1979. We have spent more than £5 million on our radical Waiting Times Initiative, leading to the treatment of 35,000 extra patients. In school we are spending nearly half as much again, in real terms per pupil, as in 1979. And there has been an enormous expansion in the training budget.  More Welsh homes - 72 per cent - are owned by those who live in them than in the United Kingdom as a whole. Since the 'Right to Buy' was introduced in 1980, we have enabled almost 90,000 council and housing association tenants to buy their own homes.  A separate Manifesto, in both English and Welsh, sets out our full programme for building on these achievements for Wales.  - WE WILL SET UP A WELSH ECONOMIC COUNCIL TO BRING TOGETHER THE VARIOUS BODIES WITH INTERESTS IN INWARD INVESTMENT, TOURISM AND SMALL BUSINESS TO ADVISE THE SECRETARY OF STATE.  - WE AIM TO REMOVE ALL SIGNIFICANT DERELICTION FROM WALES BY THE END OF THE NEW PARLIAMENT.  - WE WILL PROMOTE THE WORK OF THE COUNTRYSIDE COUNCIL FOR WALES, IN ORDER TO PROTECT THE COUNTRYSIDE AND THOSE WHO EARN THEIR LIVELIHOOD THERE.  - WE WILL GIVE FURTHER RESOURCES TO OUR RURAL INITIATIVE. AND WE WILL CONTINUE TO SUPPORT HILL FARMERS THROUGH THE HILL LIVESTOCK COMPENSATORY ALLOWANCES.  - WE WILL CONTINUE TO INVEST HEAVILY IN ROAD IMPROVEMENTS, INCLUDING THE SECOND SEVERN BRIDGE, COMPLETING THE M4 IN SOUTH WALES AND THE M5 IN NORTH WALES.  - WE WILL CONTINUE WITH OUR RECORD HOSPITAL BUILDING PROGRAMME.  - WE WILL CONTINUE TO OFFER GENEROUS FUNDING FOR HOUSING FOR WALES AND CONCENTRATE OUR EFFORTS ON THE SPECIAL NEEDS OF RURAL WALES. ALL MAJOR PUBLICLY FUNDED HOUSING DEVELOPMENTS WILL MAKE ADEQUATE PROVISION FOR THE LESS WELL OFF.  - WE WILL INTRODUCE A NEW WELSH LANGUAGE ACT.  - WE WILL PUBLISH A WHITE PAPER ON LOCAL GOVERNMENT REFORM THIS AUTUMN WITH A VIEW TO ESTABLISHING UNITARY AUTHORITIES, BASED ON THE HISTORIC COUNTIES AND COUNTY BOROUGHS. WE WILL ENSURE A FULL ROLE FOR COMMUNITY COUNCILS UNDER THESE ARRANGEMENTS.  NORTHERN IRELAND  We have upheld our pledge that Northern Ireland will remain an integral part of the United Kingdom in accordance with the democratically expressed wishes of the majority of the people who live there. It is a pledge that only the Conservative and Unionist Party can give. Conservative candidates are standing in our name and in that cause.  Our overriding objective in Northern Ireland is to eliminate the evil of terrorism. This requires progress in four areas: security, economic, social and political. The security forces in Northern Ireland perform their duties with courage and professionalism. They are entitled to expect all the necessary encouragement, and legal and material support from the Government. Under the Conservatives, the strength of the RUC has been increased, while the Emergency Provisions Act 1991 contains new powers to combat terrorist funding.  Northern Ireland is sharing in the economic transformation of the United Kingdom as a result of Conservative policies. Belfast is attracting significant new private investment. Harland and Wolff and Shorts have been successfully privatised. Major work is also under way to regenerate Londonderry and many of Ulster's smaller towns. We will continue to pursue policies to encourage enterprise and bring new jobs - by contrast with Labour, whose plan for a national minimum wage would hit the Province particularly hard.  In the new Parliament we will continue to seek to re-establish stable institutions of Government in Northern Ireland, so that powers currently exercised by Ministers in the Northern Ireland Office can be returned to locally-elected politicians.  - WE WILL ALWAYS GIVE THE SECURITY FORCES OUR FULL BACKING WITHIN THE RULE OF THE LAW, AND - AGAINST LABOUR OPPOSITION - ENSURE THAT THEY HAVE THE SPECIAL POWERS THEY NEED TO PROTECT THE WHOLE COMMUNITY FROM VIOLENCE.  - WE WILL COMPLETE THE PRIVATISATION OF NORTHERN IRELAND ELECTRICITY, TRANSFER THE WATER AND SEWAGE SERVICES TO THE PRIVATE SECTOR, AND EXAMINE WAYS OF BRINGING PRIVATE SECTOR SKILLS INTO THE MANAGEMENT OF NORTHERN IRELAND RAILWAYS.  - WE WILL CONTINUE TO PURSUE POLICIES DESIGNED TO ALLEVIATE SOCIAL NEEDS, TO PROMOTE EQUITY OF TREATMENT AND TO WIDEN THE SENSE OF COMMON PURPOSE WHICH IS GROWING IN THE PROVINCE.  - WE WILL BUILD ON THE CLOSE SECURITY CO OPERATION THAT HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED WITH THE REPUBLIC OF IRELAND UNDER THE ANGLO-IRISH AGREEMENT.  - WE WILL CONTINUE TO WORK STRENUOUSLY FOR A POLITICAL AGREEMENT WHICH IS ACCEPTABLE TO ALL THE PARTIES INVOLVED IN THE TALKS WHICH THE SECRETARY OF STATE HAS HAD DURING THE PAST YEAR WITH THE MAIN CONSTITUTIONAL PARTIES IN NORTHERN IRELAND AND THE GOVERNMENT OF THE REPUBLIC OF IRELAND. THEY HAVE PROVIDED A FIRM BASIS FOR POLITICAL PROGRESS IN ULSTER, AND FOR BUILDING NEW RELATIONSHIPS BOTH BETWEEN NORTHERN IRELAND AND THE REPUBLIC, AND IN THESE ISLANDS AS A WHOLE.  YOUR CHOICE AT THIS ELECTION  This Election is about the future. Your future. Britain's future. Our future role in the world. This is a time to go forward with conviction and confidence, not to go back to the failure and bitter controversies of the past.  It is difficult to remember the Britain we were elected to transform in 1979. The country we did transform.  It was a depressed and divided country, accustomed to failure and suspicious of change.  During the succeeding Parliaments, we have curbed inflation, reformed trade union law; encouraged enterprise, cut taxes, modernised our education and training, improved the management of our health service, given more help to the needy, extended ownership, helped through our vigilance to end the Cold War, widened our influence in Europe, and earned the respect of the world.  A decade of success ended with the problems of recession - a world recession. We know how tough it has been for many but we are poised to move forward again, lacking only the spark of confidence with which a Conservative victory would ignite recovery.  THE CHALLENGE AHEAD  The challenges of the 1990s demand a responsible and sure-footed government which understands the nature of the achievements of the 1980s and is ready to build successfully on them. A government committed to the principles of choice, ownership, responsibility and opportunity; committed to low inflation and low taxes; committed to better quality and value in our public services; committed to strong defences. Labour cannot provide that leadership. They lack experience, principle and vision.  With Socialism everywhere in rout or retreat, it is unclear what the Labour Party stands for. For public consumption, Labour leaders purport to have jettisoned the principles of a life-time. But how much can they be trusted? How genuine is the conversion and what do they actually believe?  It is clear only that Labour would threaten our achievements, undo our reforms and hamstring Britain. They would turn the clock back to policies that impoverished and divided our country. Socialism here and abroad is the regret of yesterday not the hope of tomorrow.  ONLY THE BEST FOR BRITAIN  We believe that only the best is good enough for Britain, and that the best will only be accomplished if we give the British people the freedom and the opportunity they need to succeed.  We have a new leader, proven in office, and a new agenda - yet a tried set of principles. Those principles reflect our conviction that Britain has done best when the people of Britain have been given the personal incentive to succeed. National success has not been primarily the result of accidents of geography, landscape and natural resources. Nor has it been the result of government action and state control. Success has been won when we have given our people their head: when their natural skills, talents, energy; thrift and inventiveness have been released, not suppressed. That was true when this century began; it is still true as this century draws to its close.  Britain should approach the Millennium with head and spirits high, with a strong economy, with a high standard of living, with generously endowed and well managed public services, and with secure defences. We want Britain to be an example to the world of how a free people can make the very best of their destiny. That prospect is within the grasp of us all. We must now make it happen.  The prize is great, the hope invigorating, the dream attainable. We want, with you, to make the dream a reality. A Conservative Government will help you to achieve the very best. The very best future for Britain. "
"Labour",199705,"Britain will be better with new Labour  We will make education our number one priority  We will promote personal prosperity for all  We will help create successful and profitable businesses  We will get the unemployed from welfare to work  We will save the NHS  We will be tough on crime and tough on the causes of crime  We will strengthen family life  We will help you get more out of life  We will clean up politics  We will give Britain leadership in Europe    Britain will be better with new Labour  ""Our case is simple: that Britain can and must be better""  ""The vision is one of national renewal, a country with drive, purpose and energy""  ""In each area of policy a new and distinctive approach has been mapped out, one that differs from the old left and the Conservative right. This is why new Labour is new""  ""New Labour is a party of ideas and ideals but not of outdated ideology. What counts is what works. The objectives are radical. The means will be modern""  ""This is our contract with the people""  I believe in Britain. It is a great country with a great history. The British people are a great people. But I believe Britain can and must be better: better schools, better hospitals, better ways of tackling crime, of building a modern welfare state, of equipping ourselves for a new world economy.  I want a Britain that is one nation, with shared values and purpose, where merit comes before privilege, run for the many not the few, strong and sure of itself at home and abroad.  I want a Britain that does not shuffle into the new millennium afraid of the future, but strides into it with confidence.  I want to renew our country's faith in the ability of its government and politics to deliver this new Britain.  I want to do it by making a limited set of important promises and achieving them. This is the purpose of the bond of trust I set out at the end of this introduction, in which ten specific commitments are put before you. Hold us to them. They are our covenant with you.  I want to renew faith in politics by being honest about the last 18 years. Some things the Conservatives got right. We will not change them. It is where they got things wrong that we will make change. We have no intention or desire to replace one set of dogmas by another.  I want to renew faith in politics through a government that will govern in the interest of the many, the broad majority of people who work hard, play by the rules, pay their dues and feel let down by a political system that gives the breaks to the few, to an elite at the top increasingly out of touch with the rest of us.  And I want, above all, to govern in a way that brings our country together, that unites our nation in facing the tough and dangerous challenges of the new economy and changed society in which we must live. I want a Britain which we all feel part of, in whose future we all have a stake, in which what I want for my own children I want for yours.  A new politics  The reason for having created new Labour is to meet the challenges of a different world. The millennium symbolises a new era opening up for Britain. I am confident about our future prosperity, even optimistic, if we have the courage to change and use it to build a better Britain.  To accomplish this means more than just a change of government. Our aim is no less than to set British political life on a new course for the future.  People are cynical about politics and distrustful of political promises. That is hardly surprising. There have been few more gross breaches of faith than when the Conservatives under Mr Major promised, before the election of 1992, that they would not raise taxes, but would cut them every year; and then went on to raise them by the largest amount in peacetime history starting in the first Budget after the election. The Exchange Rate Mechanism as the cornerstone of economic policy, Europe, health, crime, schools, sleaze - the broken promises are strewn across the country's memory.  The Conservatives' broken promises taint all politics. That is why we have made it our guiding rule not to promise what we cannot deliver; and to deliver what we promise. What follows is not the politics of a 100 days that dazzles for a time, then fizzles out. It is not the politics of a revolution, but of a fresh start, the patient rebuilding and renewing of this country - renewal that can take root and build over time.  That is one way in which politics in Britain will gain a new lease of life. But there is another. We aim to put behind us the bitter political struggles of left and right that have torn our country apart for too many decades. Many of these conflicts have no relevance whatsoever to the modern world - public versus private, bosses versus workers, middle class versus working class. It is time for this country to move on and move forward. We are proud of our history, proud of what we have achieved - but we must learn from our history, not be chained to it.  New Labour  The purpose of new Labour is to give Britain a different political choice: the choice between a failed Conservative government, exhausted and divided in everything other than its desire to cling on to power, and a new and revitalised Labour Party that has been resolute in transforming itself into a party of the future.  We have rewritten our constitution, the new Clause IV, to put a commitment to enterprise alongside the commitment to justice. We have changed the way we make policy, and put our relations with the trade unions on a modern footing where they accept they can get fairness but no favours from a Labour government. Our MPs are all now selected by ordinary party members, not small committees or pressure groups. The membership itself has doubled, to over 400,000, with half the members having joined since the last election.  We submitted our draft manifesto, new Labour new life for Britain, to a ballot of all our members, 95 per cent of whom gave it their express endorsement.  We are a national party, supported today by people from all walks of life, from the successful businessman or woman to the pensioner on a council estate. Young people have flooded in to join us in what is the fastest growing youth section of any political party in the western world.  The vision  We are a broad-based movement for progress and justice. New Labour is the political arm of none other than the British people as a whole. Our values are the same: the equal worth of all, with no one cast aside, fairness and justice within strong communities.  But we have liberated these values from outdated dogma or doctrine, and we have applied these values to the modern world.  I want a country in which people get on, do well, make a success of their lives. I have no time for the politics of envy. We need more successful entrepreneurs, not fewer of them. But these life-chances should be for all the people. And I want a society in which ambition and compassion are seen as partners not opposites - where we value public service as well as material wealth.  New Labour believes in a society where we do not simply pursue our own individual aims but where we hold many aims in common and work together to achieve them. How we build the industry and employment opportunities of the future; how we tackle the division and inequality in our society; how we care for and enhance our environment and quality of life; how we develop modern education and health services; how we create communities that are safe, where mutual respect and tolerance are the order of the day. These are things we must achieve together as a country.  The vision is one of national renewal, a country with drive, purpose and energy. A Britain equipped to prosper in a global economy of technological change; with a modern welfare state; its politics more accountable; and confident of its place in the world.  Programme: a new centre and centre-left politics  In each area of policy a new and distinctive approach has been mapped out, one that differs both from the solutions of the old left and those of the Conservative right. This is why new Labour is new. We believe in the strength of our values, but we recognise also that the policies of 1997 cannot be those of 1947 or 1967. More detailed policy has been produced by us than by any opposition in history. Our direction and destination are clear.  The old left would have sought state control of industry. The Conservative right is content to leave all to the market. We reject both approaches. Government and industry must work together to achieve key objectives aimed at enhancing the dynamism of the market, not undermining it.  In industrial relations, we make it clear that there will be no return to flying pickets, secondary action, strikes with no ballots or the trade union law of the 1970s. There will instead be basic minimum rights for the individual at the workplace, where our aim is partnership not conflict between employers and employees.  In economic management, we accept the global economy as a reality and reject the isolationism and 'go-it-alone' policies of the extremes of right or left.  In education, we reject both the idea of a return to the 11-plus and the monolithic comprehensive schools that take no account of children's differing abilities. Instead we favour all-in schooling which identifies the distinct abilities of individual pupils and organises them in classes to maximise their progress in individual subjects. In this way we modernise the comprehensive principle, learning from the experience of its 30 years of application.  In health policy, we will safeguard the basic principles of the NHS, which we founded, but will not return to the top-down management of the 1970s. So we will keep the planning and provision of healthcare separate, but put planning on a longer-term, decentralised and more co-operative basis. The key is to root out unnecessary administrative cost, and to spend money on the right things - frontline care.  On crime, we believe in personal responsibility and in punishing crime, but also tackling its underlying causes - so, tough on crime, tough on the causes of crime, different from the Labour approach of the past and the Tory policy of today.  Over-centralisation of government and lack of accountability was a problem in governments of both left and right. Labour is committed to the democratic renewal of our country through decentralisation and the elimination of excessive government secrecy.  In addition, we will face up to the new issues that confront us. We will be the party of welfare reform. In consultation and partnership with the people, we will design a modern welfare state based on rights and duties going together, fit for the modern world.  We will stand up for Britain's interests in Europe after the shambles of the last six years, but, more than that, we will lead a campaign for reform in Europe. Europe isn't working in the way this country and Europe need. But to lead means to be involved, to be constructive, to be capable of getting our own way.  We will put concern for the environment at the heart of policy-making, so that it is not an add-on extra, but informs the whole of government, from housing and energy policy through to global warming and international agreements.  We will search out at every turn new ways and new ideas to tackle the new issues: how to encourage more flexible working hours and practices to suit employees and employers alike; how to harness the huge potential of the new information technology; how to simplify the processes of the government machine; how to put public and private sector together in partnership to give us the infrastructure and transport system we need.  We will be a radical government.  But the definition of radicalism will not be that of doctrine, whether of left or right, but of achievement.  New Labour is a party of ideas and ideals but not of outdated ideology. What counts is what works. The objectives are radical. The means will be modern.  So the party is transformed. The vision is clear. And from that vision stems a modern programme of change and renewal for Britain.  We understand that after 18 years of one-party rule, people want change, believe that it is necessary for the country and for democracy, but require faith to make the change.  We therefore set out in the manifesto that follows ten commitments, commitments that form our bond of trust with the people. They are specific. They are real. Judge us on them. Have trust in us and we will repay that trust.  Our mission in politics is to rebuild this bond of trust between government and the people. That is the only way democracy can flourish. I pledge to Britain a government, which shares their hopes, which understands their fears, and which will work as partners with and for all our people, not just the privileged few. This is our contract with the people.  Over the five years of a Labour government:  1 Education will be our number one priority, and we will increase the share of national income spent on education as we decrease it on the bills of economic and social failure  2 There will be no increase in the basic or top rates of income tax  3 We will provide stable economic growth with low inflation, and promote dynamic and competitive business and industry at home and abroad  4 We will get 250,000 young unemployed off benefit and into work  5 We will rebuild the NHS, reducing spending on administration and increasing spending on patient care  6 We will be tough on crime and tough on the causes of crime, and halve the time it takes persistent juvenile offenders to come to court  7 We will help build strong families and strong communities, and lay the foundations of a modern welfare state in pensions and community care  8 We will safeguard our environment, and develop an integrated transport policy to fight congestion and pollution  9 We will clean up politics, decentralise political power throughout the United Kingdom and put the funding of political parties on a proper and accountable basis  10 We will give Britain the leadership in Europe which Britain and Europe need  We have modernised the Labour Party and we will modernise Britain. This means knowing where we want to go; being clear-headed about the country's future; telling the truth; making tough choices; insisting that all parts of the public sector live within their means; taking on vested interests that hold people back; standing up to unreasonable demands from any quarter; and being prepared to give a moral lead where government has responsibilities it should not avoid.  Britain does deserve better. And new Labour will be better for Britain.  A copy of the manifesto is available in Braille and on cassette.  Please phone 0171 277 3410  Visit Labour's general election website at http://www.labourwin97.org.uk  We will make education our number one priority  Cut class sizes to 30 or under for 5, 6 and 7 year-olds  Nursery places for all four year-olds  Attack low standards in schools  Access to computer technology  Lifelong learning through a new University for Industry  More spending on education as the cost of unemployment falls  Education has been the Tories' biggest failure. It is Labour's number one priority.  It is not just good for the individual. It is an economic necessity for the nation. We will compete successfully on the basis of quality or not at all. And quality comes from developing the potential of all our people. It is the people who are our greatest natural asset. We will ensure they can fulfil their potential.  Nearly half of 11 year-olds in England and Wales fail to reach expected standards in English and maths. Britain has a smaller share of 17 and 18 year-olds in full-time education than any major industrial nation. Nearly two thirds of the British workforce lack vocational qualifications.  There are excellent schools in Britain's state education system. But far too many children are denied the opportunity to succeed. Our task is to raise the standards of every school.  We will put behind us the old arguments that have bedevilled education in this country. We reject the Tories' obsession with school structures: all parents should be offered real choice through good quality schools, each with its own strengths and individual ethos. There should be no return to the 11-plus. It divides children into successes and failures at far too early an age.  We must modernise comprehensive schools. Children are not all of the same ability, nor do they learn at the same speed. That means 'setting' children in classes to maximise progress, for the benefit of high-fliers and slower learners alike. The focus must be on levelling up, not levelling down.  With Labour, the Department for Education and Employment will become a leading office of state. It will give a strong and consistent lead to help raise standards in every school. Standards, more than structures, are the key to success. Labour will never put dogma before children's education. Our approach will be to intervene where there are problems, not where schools are succeeding.  Labour will never force the abolition of good schools whether in the private or state sector. Any changes in the admissions policies of grammar schools will be decided by local parents. Church schools will retain their distinctive religious ethos.  We wish to build bridges wherever we can across education divides. The educational apartheid created by the public/private divide diminishes the whole education system.  Zero tolerance of under performance  Every school has the capacity to succeed. All Local Education Authorities (LEAs) must demonstrate that every school is improving. For those failing schools unable to improve, ministers will order a 'fresh start' - close the school and start afresh on the same site. Where good schools and bad schools coexist side by side we will authorise LEAs to allow one school to take over the other to set the under performing school on a new path.  Quality nursery education guaranteed for all four year-olds  Nursery vouchers have been proven not to work. They are costly and do not generate more quality nursery places. We will use the money saved by scrapping nursery vouchers to guarantee places for four year-olds. We will invite selected local authorities to pilot early excellence centres combining education and care for the under-fives. We will set targets for universal provision for three year-olds whose parents want it.  New focus on standards in primary schools  Primary schools are the key to mastering the basics and developing in every child an eagerness to learn.  Every school needs baseline assessment of pupils when they enter the school, and a year-on-year target for improvement.  We will reduce class sizes for five, six and seven year-olds to 30 or under, by phasing out the assisted places scheme, the cost of which is set to rise to £180 million per year.  We must recognise the three 'r's for what they are - building blocks of all learning that must be taught better. We will achieve this by improving the skills of the teaching force; ensuring a stronger focus on literacy in the curriculum; and piloting literacy summer schools to meet our new target that within a decade every child leaves primary school with a reading age of at least 11 (barely half do today).  Our numeracy taskforce will develop equally ambitious targets. We will encourage the use of the most effective teaching methods, including phonics for reading and whole class interactive teaching for maths.  Attacking educational disadvantage  No matter where a school is, Labour will not tolerate under-achievement.  Public/private partnerships will improve the condition of school buildings.  There will be education action zones to attack low standards by recruiting the best teachers and head teachers to under-achieving schools; by supporting voluntary mentoring schemes to provide one-to-one support for disadvantaged pupils; and by creating new opportunities for children, after the age of 14, to enhance their studies by acquiring knowledge and experience within industry and commerce.  To attack under-achievement in urban areas, we have developed a new scheme with the Premier League. In partnerships between central government, local government and football clubs, study support centres will be set up at Premier League grounds for the benefit of local children. The scheme will be launched on a pilot basis during the 1997/8 season.  We support the greatest possible integration into mainstream education of pupils with special educational needs, while recognising that specialist facilities are essential to meet particular needs.  Realising the potential of new technology  Labour is the pioneer of new thinking. We have agreed with British Telecom and the cable companies that they will wire up schools, libraries, colleges and hospitals to the information superhighway free of charge. We have also secured agreement to make access charges as low as possible.  For the Internet we plan a National Grid for Learning, franchised as a public/private partnership, which will bring to teachers up-to-date materials to enhance their skills, and to children high-quality educational materials. We will use lottery money to improve the skills of existing teachers in information technology.  In opposition, Labour set up the independent Stevenson Commission to promote access for children to new technology. Its recent report is a challenging programme for the future. We are urgently examining how to implement its plans, in particular the development of educational software through a grading system which will provide schools with guarantees of product quality; and the provision for every child of an individual email address. An independent standing committee will continue to advise us on the implementation of our plans in government.  The role of parents  We will increase the powers and responsibilities of parents.  There will be more parent governors and, for the first time, parent representatives on LEAs.  A major objective is to promote a culture of responsibility for learning within the family, through contracts between all schools and parents, defining the responsibilities of each. National guidelines will establish minimum periods for homework for primary and secondary school pupils.  Teachers will be entitled to positive support from parents to promote good attendance and sound discipline. Schools suffer from unruly and disruptive pupils. Exclusion or suspension may sometimes be necessary. We will, however, pilot new pupil referral units so that schools are protected but these pupils are not lost to education or the country.  New job description for LEAs  The judge and jury of LEA performance will be their contribution to raising standards.  LEAs are closer to schools than central government, and have the authority of being locally elected. But they will be required to devolve power, and more of their budgets, to heads and governors. LEA performance will be inspected by Ofsted and the Audit Commission. Where authorities are deemed to be failing, the secretary of state may suspend the relevant powers of the LEA and send in an improvement team.  Grant maintained schools  Schools that are now grant maintained will prosper with Labour's proposals, as will every school.  Tory claims that Labour will close these schools are false. The system of funding will not discriminate unfairly either between schools or between pupils. LEAs will be represented on governing bodies, but will not control them. We support guidelines for open and fair admissions, along the lines of those introduced in 1993; but we will also provide a right of appeal to an independent panel in disputed cases.  Teachers: pressure and support  Schools are critically dependent on the quality of all staff. The majority of teachers are skilful and dedicated, but some fall short. We will improve teacher training, and ensure that all teachers have an induction year when they first qualify, to ensure their suitability for teaching.  There will be a general teaching council to speak for and raise standards in the profession. We will create a new grade of teachers to recognise the best. There will, however, be speedy, but fair, procedures to remove teachers who cannot do the job.  The strength of a school is critically dependent on the quality of its head. We will establish mandatory qualifications for the post. A head teacher will be appointed to a position only when fully trained to accept the responsibility.  Higher education  The improvement and expansion needed cannot be funded out of general taxation. Our proposals for funding have been made to the Dearing Committee, in line with successful policies abroad.  The costs of student maintenance should be repaid by graduates on an income-related basis, from the career success to which higher education has contributed. The current system is badly administered and payback periods are too short. We will provide efficient administration, with fairness ensured by longer payback periods where required.  Lifelong learning  We must learn throughout life, to retain employment through new and improved skills. We will promote adult learning both at work and in the critical sector of further education.  In schools and colleges, we support broader A-levels and upgraded vocational qualifications, underpinned by rigorous standards and key skills.  Employers have the primary responsibility for training their workforces in job-related skills. But individuals should be given the power to invest in training. We will invest public money for training in Individual Learning Accounts which individuals - for example women returning to the labour force - can then use to gain the skills they want. We will kick-start the programme for up to a million people, using £150 million of TEC money which could be better used and which would provide a contribution of £150, alongside individuals making small investments of their own. Employers will be encouraged to make voluntary contributions to these funds. We will also promote the extension of the Investors in People initiative into many more small firms.  Our new University for Industry, collaborating with the Open University, will bring new opportunities to adults seeking to develop their potential. This will bring government, industry and education together to create a new resource whose remit will be to use new technology to enhance skills and education. The University for Industry will be a public/private partnership, commissioning software and developing the links to extend lifelong learning.  Government spending on education  The Conservatives have cut government spending on education as a share of national income by the equivalent of more than £3 billion as spending on the bills of economic and social failure has risen. We are committed to reversing this trend of spending. Over the course of a five-year Parliament, as we cut the costs of economic and social failure we will raise the proportion of national income spent on education.  We will promote personal prosperity for all  Economic stability to promote investment  Tough inflation target, mortgage rates as low as possible  Stick for two years within existing spending limits  Five-year pledge: no increase in income tax rates  Long-term objective of ten pence starting rate of income tax  Early Budget to get people off welfare and into work  T he Conservatives have in 18 years created the two longest, deepest recessions this century. We have experienced the slowest average growth rate of any similar period since the Second World War. There has been a fundamental failure to tackle the underlying causes of inflation, of low growth and of unemployment. These are:  too much economic instability, with wild swings from boom to bust  too little investment in education and skills, and in the application of new technologies  too few opportunities to find jobs, start new businesses or become self-employed  too narrow an industrial base  and too little sense of common purpose in the workplace or across the nation.  Britain can do better. We must build on the British qualities of inventiveness, creativity and adaptability. New Labour's objective is to improve living standards for the many, not just the few. Business can and must succeed in raising productivity. This requires a combination of a skilled and educated workforce with investment in the latest technological innovations, as the route to higher wages and employment.  An explicit objective of a Labour government will be to raise the trend rate of growth by strengthening our wealth-creating base. We will nurture investment in industry, skills, infrastructure and new technologies. And we will attack long-term unemployment, especially among young people. Our goal will be educational and employment opportunities for all.  Economic stability is the essential platform for sustained growth. In a global economy the route to growth is stability not inflation. The priority must be stable, low-inflation conditions for long-term growth. The root causes of inflation and low growth are the same - an economic and industrial base that remains weak. Government cannot solve all economic problems or end the economic cycle. But by spending wisely and taxing fairly, government can help tackle the problems. Our goals are low inflation, rising living standards and high and stable levels of employment.  Spending and tax: new Labour's approach  The myth that the solution to every problem is increased spending has been comprehensively dispelled under the Conservatives. Spending has risen. But more spending has brought neither greater fairness nor less poverty. Quite the reverse - our society is more divided than it has been for generations. The level of public spending is no longer the best measure of the effectiveness of government action in the public interest. It is what money is actually spent on that counts more than how much money is spent.  The national debt has doubled under John Major. The public finances remain weak. A new Labour government will give immediate high priority to seeing how public money can be better used.  New Labour will be wise spenders, not big spenders. We will work in partnership with the private sector to achieve our goals. We will ask about public spending the first question that a manager in any company would ask - can existing resources be used more effectively to meet our priorities? And because efficiency and value for money are central, ministers will be required to save before they spend.  Save to invest is our approach, not tax and spend.  The increase in taxes under the Conservatives is the most dramatic evidence of economic failure. Since 1992 the typical family has paid more than £2,000 in extra taxes - the biggest tax hike in peacetime history, breaking every promise made by John Major at the last election. The tragedy is that those hardest hit are least able to pay. That is why we strongly opposed the imposition of VAT on fuel: it was Labour that stopped the government from increasing VAT on fuel to 17.5 per cent.  Taxation is not neutral in the way it raises revenue. How and what governments tax sends clear signals about the economic activities they believe should be encouraged or discouraged, and the values they wish to entrench in society. Just as, for example, work should be encouraged through the tax system, environmental pollution should be discouraged.  New Labour will establish a new trust on tax with the British people. The promises we make we will keep. The principles that will underpin our tax policy are clear:  to encourage employment opportunities and work incentives for all  to promote savings and investment  and to be fair and be seen to be fair.  New Labour is not about high taxes on ordinary families. It is about social justice and a fair deal.  New Labour therefore makes the following economic pledges.  Fair taxes  There will be no return to the penal tax rates that existed under both Labour and Conservative governments in the 1970s.  To encourage work and reward effort, we are pledged not to raise the basic or top rates of income tax throughout the next Parliament.  Our long-term objective is a lower starting rate of income tax of ten pence in the pound. Reducing the high marginal rates at the bottom end of the earning scale - often 70 or 80 per cent - is not only fair but desirable to encourage employment.  This goal will benefit the many, not the few. It is in sharp contrast to the Tory goal of abolishing capital gains and inheritance tax, at least half the benefit of which will go to the richest 5,000 families in the country.  We will cut VAT on fuel to five per cent, the lowest level allowed.  We renew our pledge not to extend VAT to food, children's clothes, books and newspapers and public transport fares.  We will also examine the interaction of the tax and benefits systems so that they can be streamlined and modernised, so as to fulfil our objectives of promoting work incentives, reducing poverty and welfare dependency, and strengthening community and family life.  No risks with inflation  We will match the current target for low and stable inflation of 2.5 per cent or less. We will reform the Bank of England to ensure that decision-making on monetary policy is more effective, open, accountable and free from short-term political manipulation.  Strict rules for government borrowing  We will enforce the 'golden rule' of public spending - over the economic cycle, we will only borrow to invest and not to fund current expenditure.  We will ensure that - over the economic cycle - public debt as a proportion of national income is at a stable and prudent level.  Stick to planned public spending allocations for the first two years of office  Our decisions have not been taken lightly. They are a recognition of Conservative mismanagement of the public finances. For the next two years Labour will work within the departmental ceilings for spending already announced. We will resist unreasonable demands on the public purse, including any unreasonable public sector pay demands.  Switch spending from economic failure to investment  We will conduct a central spending review and departmental reviews to assess how to use resources better, while rooting out waste and inefficiency in public spending.  Labour priorities in public spending are different from Tory priorities.  Tax reform to promote saving and investment  We will introduce a new individual savings account and extend the principle of TESSAs and PEPs to promote long-term saving. We will review the corporate and capital gains tax regimes to see how the tax system can promote greater long-term investment.  Labour's welfare-to-work Budget  We will introduce a Budget within two months after the election to begin the task of equipping the British economy and reforming the welfare state to get young people and the long-term unemployed back to work. This welfare-to-work programme will be funded by a windfall levy on the excess profits of the privatised utilities, introduced in this Budget after we have consulted the regulators.  We will help create successful and profitable businesses  Backing business: skills, infrastructure, new markets  Gains for consumers with tough competition law  New measures to help small businesses  National minimum wage to tackle low pay  Boost local economic growth with Regional Development Agencies  A strong and effective voice in Europe  New Labour offers business a new deal for the future. We will leave intact the main changes of the 1980s in industrial relations and enterprise. We see healthy profits as an essential motor of a dynamic market economy, and believe they depend on quality products, innovative entrepreneurs and skilled employees. We will build a new partnership with business to improve the competitiveness of British industry for the 21st century, leading to faster growth.  Many of the fundamentals of the British economy are still weak. Low pay and low skills go together: insecurity is the consequence of economic instability; the absence of quality jobs is a product of the weakness of our industrial base; we suffer from both high unemployment and skills shortages. There is no future for Britain as a low wage economy: we cannot compete on wages with countries paying a tenth or a hundredth of British wages.  We need to win on higher quality, skill, innovation and reliability. With Labour, British and inward investors will find this country an attractive and profitable place to do business.  New Labour believes in a flexible labour market that serves employers and employees alike. But flexibility alone is not enough. We need 'flexibility plus':  plus higher skills and higher standards in our schools and colleges  plus policies to ensure economic stability  plus partnership with business to raise investment in infrastructure, science and research and to back small firms  plus new leadership from Britain to reform Europe, in place of the current policy of drift and disengagement from our largest market  plus guaranteeing Britain's membership of the single market - indeed opening up further markets inside and outside the EU - helping make Britain an attractive place to do business  plus minimum standards of fair treatment, including a national minimum wage  plus an imaginative welfare-to-work programme to put the long-term unemployed back to work and to cut social security costs.  A reformed and tougher competition law  Competitiveness abroad must begin with competition at home. Effective competition can bring value and quality to consumers. As an early priority we will reform Britain's competition law. We will adopt a tough 'prohibitive' approach to deter anti-competitive practices and abuses of market power.  In the utility industries we will promote competition wherever possible. Where competition is not an effective discipline, for example in the water industry which has a poor environmental record and has in most cases been a tax-free zone, we will pursue tough, efficient regulation in the interests of customers, and, in the case of water, in the interests of the environment as well. We recognise the need for open and predictable regulation which is fair both to consumers and to shareholders and at the same time provides incentives for managers to innovate and improve efficiency.  Reinvigorate the Private Finance Initiative  Britain's infrastructure is dangerously run down: parts of our road and rail network are seriously neglected, and all too often our urban environment has been allowed to deteriorate.  Labour pioneered the idea of public/private partnerships. It is Labour local authorities which have done most to create these partnerships at local level.  A Labour government will overcome the problems that have plagued the PFI at a national level. We will set priorities between projects, saving time and expense; we will seek a realistic allocation of risk between the partners to a project; and we will ensure that best practice is spread throughout government. We will aim to simplify and speed up the planning process for major infrastructure projects of vital national interest.  We will ensure that self-financing commercial organisations within the public sector - the Post Office is a prime example - are given greater commercial freedom to make the most of new opportunities.  Backing small business  The number of small employers has declined by half a million since 1990. Support for small businesses will have a major role in our plans for economic growth. We will cut unnecessary red tape; provide for statutory interest on late payment of debts; improve support for high-tech start-ups; improve the quality and relevance of advice and training through a reformed Business Links network and the University for Industry; and assist firms to enter overseas markets more effectively.  Local economic growth  Prosperity needs to be built from the bottom up. We will establish one-stop regional development agencies to co-ordinate regional economic development, help small business and encourage inward investment. Many regions are already taking informal steps to this end and they will be supported.  Strengthen our capability in science, technology and design  The UK must be positively committed to the global pursuit of new knowledge, with a strong science base in our universities and centres of excellence leading the world. The Dearing Committee represents a significant opportunity to promote high-quality standards in science teaching and research throughout UK higher education. We support a collaborative approach between researchers and business, spreading the use of new technology and good design, and exploiting our own inventions to boost business in the UK.  Promoting new green technologies and businesses  There is huge potential to develop Britain's environmental technology industries to create jobs, win exports and protect the environment.  Effective environmental management is an increasingly important component of modern business practice. We support a major push to promote energy conservation - particularly by the promotion of home energy efficiency schemes, linked to our environment taskforce for the under-25s. We are committed to an energy policy designed to promote cleaner, more efficient energy use and production, including a new and strong drive to develop renewable energy sources such as solar and wind energy, and combined heat and power. We see no economic case for the building of any new nuclear power stations.  Key elements of the 1980s trade union reforms to stay  There must be minimum standards for the individual at work, including a minimum wage, within a flexible labour market. We need a sensible balance in industrial relations law - rights and duties go together.  The key elements of the trade union legislation of the 1980s will stay - on ballots, picketing and industrial action. People should be free to join or not to join a union. Where they do decide to join, and where a majority of the relevant workforce vote in a ballot for the union to represent them, the union should be recognised. This promotes stable and orderly industrial relations. There will be full consultation on the most effective means of implementing this proposal.  Partnership at work  The best companies recognise their employees as partners in the enterprise. Employees whose conditions are good are more committed to their companies and are more productive. Many unions and employers are embracing partnership in place of conflict. Government should welcome this.  We are keen to encourage a variety of forms of partnership and enterprise, spreading ownership and encouraging more employees to become owners through Employee Share Ownership Plans and co-operatives. We support too the Social Chapter of the EU, but will deploy our influence in Europe to ensure that it develops so as to promote employability and competitiveness, not inflexibility.  A sensibly set national minimum wage  There should be a statutory level beneath which pay should not fall - with the minimum wage decided not on the basis of a rigid formula but according to the economic circumstances of the time and with the advice of an independent low pay commission, whose membership will include representatives of employers, including small business, and employees.  Every modern industrial country has a minimum wage, including the US and Japan. Britain used to have minimum wages through the Wages Councils. Introduced sensibly, the minimum wage will remove the worst excesses of low pay (and be of particular benefit to women), while cutting some of the massive £4 billion benefits bill by which the taxpayer subsidises companies that pay very low wages.  We will get the unemployed from welfare to work  Stop the growth of an 'underclass' in Britain  250,000 young unemployed off benefit and into work  Tax cuts for employers who create new jobs for the long-term unemployed  Effective help for lone parents  There are over one million fewer jobs in Britain than in 1990. One in five families has no one working. One million single mothers are trapped on benefits. There is a wider gap between rich and poor than for generations.  We are determined not to continue down the road of a permanent have-not class, unemployed and disaffected from society. Our long-term objective is high and stable levels of employment. This is the true meaning of a stakeholder economy - where everyone has a stake in society and owes responsibilities to it.  The best way to tackle poverty is to help people into jobs - real jobs. The unemployed have a responsibility to take up the opportunity of training places or work, but these must be real opportunities. The government's workfare proposals - with a success rate of one in ten - fail this test.  Labour's welfare-to-work programme will attack unemployment and break the spiral of escalating spending on social security. A one-off windfall levy on the excess profits of the privatised utilities will fund our ambitious programme.  Every young person unemployed for more than six months in a job or training  We will give 250,000 under-25s opportunities for work, education and training. Four options will be on offer, each involving day-release education or training leading to a qualification:  private-sector job: employers will be offered a £60-a-week rebate for six months  work with a non-profit voluntary sector employer, paying a weekly wage, equivalent to benefit plus a fixed sum for six months  full-time study for young people without qualifications on an approved course  a job with the environment taskforce, linked to Labour's citizens' service programme.  Rights and responsibilities must go hand in hand, without a fifth option of life on full benefit.  Every 16 and 17 year-old on the road to a proper qualification by the year 2000  Nearly a third of young people do not achieve an NVQ level two qualification by age 19. All young people will be offered part-time or full-time education after the age of 16. Any under-18 year-old in a job will have the right to study on an approved course for qualifications at college. We will replace the failed Youth Training scheme with our new Target 2000 programme, offering young people high-quality education and training.  Action on long-term unemployment  New partnerships between government and business, fully involving local authorities and the voluntary sector, will attack long-term joblessness. We will encourage employers to take on those who have suffered unemployment for more than two years with a £75-a-week tax rebate paid for six months, financed by the windfall levy. Our programme for the phased release of past receipts from council house sales will provide new jobs in the construction industry.  Lone parents into work  Today the main connection between unemployed lone parents and the state is their benefits. Most lone parents want to work, but are given no help to find it. New Labour has a positive policy. Once the youngest child is in the second term of full-time school, lone parents will be offered advice by a proactive Employment Service to develop a package of job search, training and after-school care to help them off benefit.  Customised, personalised services  We favour initiatives with new combinations of available benefits to suit individual circumstances. In new and innovative 'Employment Zones', personal job accounts will combine money currently available for benefits and training, to offer the unemployed new options - leading to work and independence. We will co-ordinate benefits, employment and career services, and utilise new technology to improve their quality and efficiency.  Fraud  Just as we owe it to the taxpayer to crack down on tax avoidance, so we must crack down on dishonesty in the benefit system. We will start with a clampdown on Housing Benefit fraud, estimated to cost £2 billion a year, and will maintain action against benefit fraud of all kinds.  We will save the NHS  100,000 people off waiting lists  End the Tory internal market  End waiting for cancer surgery  Tough quality targets for hospitals  Independent food standards agency  New public health drive  Raise spending in real terms every year - and spend the money on patients not bureaucracy  Labour created the NHS 50 years ago. It is under threat from the Conservatives. We want to save and modernise the NHS.  But if the Conservatives are elected again there may well not be an NHS in five years' time - neither national nor comprehensive. Labour commits itself anew to the historic principle: that if you are ill or injured there will be a national health service there to help; and access to it will be based on need and need alone - not on your ability to pay, or on who your GP happens to be or on where you live.  In 1990 the Conservatives imposed on the NHS a complex internal market of hospitals competing to win contracts from health authorities and fundholding GPs. The result is an NHS strangled by costly red tape, with every individual transaction the subject of a separate invoice. After six years, bureaucracy swallows an extra £1.5 billion per year; there are 20,000 more managers and 50,000 fewer nurses on the wards; and more than one million people are on waiting lists. The government has consistently failed to meet even its own health targets.  There can be no return to top-down management, but Labour will end the Conservatives' internal market in healthcare. The planning and provision of care are necessary and distinct functions, and will remain so. But under the Tories, the administrative costs of purchasing care have undermined provision and the market system has distorted clinical priorities. Labour will cut costs by removing the bureaucratic processes of the internal market.  The savings achieved will go on direct care for patients. As a start, the first £100 million saved will treat an extra 100,000 patients. We will end waiting for cancer surgery, thereby helping thousands of women waiting for breast cancer treatment.  Primary care will play a lead role  In recent years, GPs have gained power on behalf of their patients in a changed relationship with consultants, and we support this. But the development of GP fundholding has also brought disadvantages. Decision-making has been fragmented. Administrative costs have grown. And a two-tier service has resulted.  Labour will retain the lead role for primary care but remove the disadvantages that have come from the present system. GPs and nurses will take the lead in combining together locally to plan local health services more efficiently for all the patients in their area. This will enable all GPs in an area to bring their combined strength to bear upon individual hospitals to secure higher standards of patient provision. In making this change, we will build on the existing collaborative schemes which already serve 14 million people.  The current system of year-on-year contracts is costly and unstable. We will introduce three- to five-year agreements between the local primary care teams and hospitals. Hospitals will then be better able to plan work at full capacity and co-operate to enhance patient services.  Higher-quality services for patients  Hospitals will retain their autonomy over day-to-day administrative functions, but, as part of the NHS, they will be required to meet high-quality standards in the provision of care. Management will be held to account for performance levels. Boards will become more representative of the local communities they serve.  A new patients' charter will concentrate on the quality and success of treatment. The Tories' so-called 'Efficiency Index' counts the number of patient 'episodes', not the quality or success of treatment. With Labour, the measure will be quality of outcome, itself an incentive for effectiveness. As part of our concern to ensure quality, we will work towards the elimination of mixed-sex wards.  Health authorities will become the guardians of high standards. They will monitor services, spread best practice and ensure rising standards of care.  The Tory attempt to use private money to build hospitals has failed to deliver. Labour will overcome the problems that have plagued the Private Finance Initiative, end the delays, sort out the confusion and develop new forms of public/private partnership that work better and protect the interests of the NHS. Labour is opposed to the privatisation of clinical services which is being actively promoted by the Conservatives.  Labour will promote new developments in telemedicine - bringing expert advice from regional centres of excellence to neighbourhood level using new technology.  Good health  A new minister for public health will attack the root causes of ill health, and so improve lives and save the NHS money. Labour will set new goals for improving the overall health of the nation which recognise the impact that poverty, poor housing, unemployment and a polluted environment have on health.  Smoking is the greatest single cause of preventable illness and premature death in the UK. We will therefore ban tobacco advertising.  Labour will establish an independent food standards agency. The £3.5 billion BSE crisis and the E. coli outbreak which resulted in serious loss of life, have made unanswerable the case for the independent agency we have proposed.  NHS spending  The Conservatives have wasted spending on the NHS. We will do better. We will raise spending on the NHS in real terms every year and put the money towards patient care. And a greater proportion of every pound spent will go on patient care not bureaucracy.  An NHS for the future  The NHS requires continuity as well as change, or the system cannot cope. There must be pilots to ensure that change works. And there must be flexibility, not rigid prescription, if innovation is to flourish.  Our fundamental purpose is simple but hugely important: to restore the NHS as a public service working co-operatively for patients, not a commercial business driven by competition.  We will be tough on crime and tough on the causes of crime  Fast-track punishment for persistent young offenders  Reform Crown Prosecution Service to convict more criminals  Police on the beat not pushing paper  Crackdown on petty crimes and neighbourhood disorder  Fresh parliamentary vote to ban all handguns  Under the Conservatives, crime has doubled and many more criminals get away with their crimes: the number of people convicted has fallen by a third, with only one crime in 50 leading to a conviction. This is the worst record of any government since the Second World War - and for England and Wales the worst record of any major industrialised country. Last year alone violent crime rose 11 per cent.  We propose a new approach to law and order: tough on crime and tough on the causes of crime. We insist on individual responsibility for crime, and will attack the causes of crime by our measures to relieve social deprivation.  The police have our strong support. They are in the front line of the fight against crime and disorder. The Conservatives have broken their 1992 general election pledge to provide an extra 1,000 police officers. We will relieve the police of unnecessary bureaucratic burdens to get more officers back on the beat.  Youth crime  Youth crime and disorder have risen sharply, but very few young offenders end up in court, and when they do half are let off with another warning. Young offenders account for seven million crimes a year.  Far too often young criminals offend again and again while waiting months for a court hearing. We will halve the time it takes to get persistent young offenders from arrest to sentencing; replace widespread repeat cautions with a single final warning; bring together Youth Offender Teams in every area; and streamline the system of youth courts to make it far more effective.  New parental responsibility orders will make parents face up to their responsibility for their children's misbehaviour.  Conviction and sentencing  The job of the Crown Prosecution Service is to prosecute criminals effectively. There is strong evidence that the CPS is over-centralised, bureaucratic and inefficient, with cases too often dropped, delayed, or downgraded to lesser offences.  Labour will decentralise the CPS, with local crown prosecutors co-operating more effectively with local police forces.  We will implement an effective sentencing system for all the main offences to ensure greater consistency and stricter punishment for serious repeat offenders. The courts will have to spell out what each sentence really means in practice. The Court of Appeal will have a duty to lay down sentencing guidelines for all the main offences. The attorney general's power to appeal unduly lenient sentences will be extended.  The prison service now faces serious financial problems. We will audit the resources available, take proper ministerial responsibility for the service, and seek to ensure that prison regimes are constructive and require inmates to face up to their offending behaviour.  Disorder  The Conservatives have forgotten the 'order' part of 'law and order'. We will tackle the unacceptable level of anti-social behaviour and crime on our streets. Our 'zero tolerance' approach will ensure that petty criminality among young offenders is seriously addressed.  Community safety orders will deal with threatening and disruptive criminal neighbours. Labour has taken the lead in proposing action to tackle the problems of stalking and domestic violence.  Child protection orders will deal with young children suffering neglect by parents because they are left out on their own far too late at night.  Britain is a multiracial and multicultural society. All its members must have the protection of the law. We will create a new offence of racial harassment and a new crime of racially motivated violence to protect ethnic minorities from intimidation.  Drugs  The vicious circle of drugs and crime wrecks lives and threatens communities. Labour will appoint an anti-drugs supremo to co-ordinate our battle against drugs across all government departments. The 'drug czar' will be a symbol of our commitment to tackle the modern menace of drugs in our communities.  We will pilot the use of compulsory drug testing and treatment orders for offenders to ensure that the link between drug addiction and crime is broken. This will be paid for by bringing remand delays down to the national targets.  We will attack the drug problem in prisons. In addition to random drug testing of all prisoners we will aim for a voluntary testing unit in every prison for prisoners ready to prove they are drug-free.  Victims  Victims of crime are too often neglected by the criminal justice system. We will ensure that victims are kept fully informed of the progress of their case, and why charges may have been downgraded or dropped.  Greater protection will be provided for victims in rape and serious sexual offence trials and for those subject to intimidation, including witnesses.  Prevention  We will place a new responsibility on local authorities to develop statutory partnerships to help prevent crime. Local councils will then be required to set targets for the reduction of crime and disorder in their area.  Gun control  In the wake of Dunblane and Hungerford, it is clear that only the strictest firearms laws can provide maximum safety. The Conservatives failed to offer the protection required. Labour led the call for an outright ban on all handguns in general civilian use. There will be legislation to allow individual MPs a free vote for a complete ban on handguns.  Labour is the party of law and order in Britain today.  We will strengthen family life  Help parents balance work and family  Security in housing and help for homeowners  Tackle homelessness using receipts from council house sales  Dignity and security in retirement  Protect the basic state pension and promote secure second pensions  We will uphold family life as the most secure means of bringing up our children. Families are the core of our society. They should teach right from wrong. They should be the first defence against anti-social behaviour. The breakdown of family life damages the fabric of our society.  Labour does not see families and the state as rival providers for the needs of our citizens. Families should provide the day-to-day support for children to be brought up in a stable and loving environment. But families cannot flourish unless government plays its distinctive role: in education; where necessary, in caring for the young; in making adequate provision for illness and old age; in supporting good parenting; and in protecting families from lawlessness and abuse of power. Society, through government, must assist families to achieve collectively what no family can achieve alone.  Yet families in Britain today are under strain as never before. The security once offered by the health service has been undermined. Streets are not safe. Housing insecurity grows. One in five non-pensioner families has no one working; and British men work the longest hours in Europe.  The clock should not be turned back. As many women who want to work should be able to do so. More equal relationships between men and women have transformed our lives. Equally, our attitudes to race, sex and sexuality have changed fundamentally. Our task is to combine change and social stability.  Work and family  Families without work are without independence. This is why we give so much emphasis to our welfare-to-work policies.  Labour's national childcare strategy will plan provision to match the requirements of the modern labour market and help parents, especially women, to balance family and working life.  There must be a sound balance between support for family life and the protection of business from undue burdens - a balance which some of the most successful businesses already strike. The current government has shown itself wholly insensitive to the need to help develop family-friendly working practices. While recognising the need for flexibility in implementation and for certain exemptions, we support the right of employees not to be forced to work more than 48 hours a week; to an annual holiday entitlement; and to limited unpaid parental leave. These measures will provide a valuable underpinning to family life.  The rights of part-time workers have been clarified by recent court judgements which we welcome.  We will keep under continuous review all aspects of the tax and benefits systems to ensure that they are supportive of families and children. We are committed to retain universal Child Benefit where it is universal today - from birth to age 16 - and to uprate it at least in line with prices. We are reviewing educational finance and maintenance for those older than 16 to ensure higher staying-on rates at school and college, and that resources are used to support those in most need. This review will continue in government on the guidelines we have already laid down.  Security in housing  Most families want to own their own homes. We will also support efficiently run social and private rented sectors offering quality and choice.  The Conservatives' failure on housing has been twofold. The two thirds of families who own their homes have suffered a massive increase in insecurity over the last decade, with record mortgage arrears, record negative equity and record repossessions. And the Conservatives' lack of a housing strategy has led to the virtual abandonment of social housing, the growth of homelessness, and a failure to address fully leaseholder reform. All these are the Tory legacy.  Labour's housing strategy will address the needs of homeowners and tenants alike.  We will reject the boom and bust policies which caused the collapse of the housing market.  We will work with mortgage providers to encourage greater provision of more flexible mortgages to protect families in a world of increased job insecurity.  Mortgage buyers also require stronger consumer protection, for example by extension of the Financial Services Act, against the sale of disadvantageous mortgage packages.  The problems of gazumping have reappeared. Those who break their bargains should be liable to pay the costs inflicted on others, in particular legal and survey costs. We are consulting on the best way of tackling the problems of gazumping in the interests of responsible home buyers and sellers.  The rented housing sector  We support a three-way partnership between the public, private and housing association sectors to promote good social housing. With Labour, capital receipts from the sale of council houses, received but not spent by local councils, will be re-invested in building new houses and rehabilitating old ones. This will be phased to match the capacity of the building industry and to meet the requirements of prudent economic management.  We also support effective schemes to deploy private finance to improve the public housing stock and to introduce greater diversity and choice. Such schemes should only go ahead with the support of the tenants concerned: we oppose the government's threat to hand over council housing to private landlords without the consent of tenants and with no guarantees on rents or security of tenure.  We value a revived private rented sector. We will provide protection where most needed: for tenants in houses in multiple occupation.  There will be a proper system of licensing by local authorities which will benefit tenants and responsible landlords alike.  We will introduce 'commonhold', a new form of tenure enabling people living in flats to own their homes individually and to own the whole property collectively. We will simplify the current rules restricting the purchase of freeholds by leaseholders.  Homelessness  Homelessness has more than doubled under the Conservatives. Today more than 40,000 families in England are in expensive temporary accommodation. The government, in the face of Labour opposition, has removed the duty on local authorities to find permanent housing for homeless families. We will impose a new duty on local authorities to protect those who are homeless through no fault of their own and are in priority need.  There is no more powerful symbol of Tory neglect in our society today than young people without homes living rough on the streets. Young people emerging from care without any family support are particularly vulnerable. We will attack the problem in two principal ways: the phased release of capital receipts from council house sales will increase the stock of housing for rent; and our welfare-to-work programme will lead the young unemployed into work and financial independence.  Older citizens  We value the positive contribution that older people make to our society, through their families, voluntary activities and work. Their skills and experience should be utilised within their communities. That is why, for example, we support the proposal to involve older people as volunteers to help children learn in pre-school and after-school clubs. In work, they should not be discriminated against because of their age.  The provision of adequate pensions in old age is a major challenge for the future. For today's pensioners Conservative policies have created real poverty, growing inequality and widespread insecurity.  The Conservatives would abolish the state-financed basic retirement pension and replace it with a privatised scheme, with a vague promise of a means-tested state guarantee if pensions fall beneath a minimum level. Their proposals mean there will be no savings on welfare spending for half a century; and taxes will have to rise to make provision for new privately funded pensions. Their plans require an additional £312 billion between now and 2040 through increased taxes or borrowing, against the hope of savings later, with no certainty of security in retirement at the end.  We believe that all pensioners should share fairly in the increasing prosperity of the nation. Instead of privatisation, we propose a partnership between public and private provision, and a balance between income sourced from tax and invested savings. The basic state pension will be retained as the foundation of pension provision. It will be increased at least in line with prices. We will examine means of delivering more automatic help to the poorest pensioners - one million of whom do not even receive the Income Support which is their present entitlement.  We will encourage saving for retirement, with proper protection for savings. We will reform the Financial Services Act so that the scandal of pension mis-selling - 600,000 pensions mis-sold and only 7,000 people compensated to date - will not happen again.  Too many people in work, particularly those on low and modest incomes and with changing patterns of employment, cannot join good-value second pension schemes. Labour will create a new framework - stakeholder pensions - to meet this need. We will encourage new partnerships between financial service companies, employers and employees to develop these pension schemes. They will be approved to receive people's savings only if they meet high standards of value for money, flexibility and security.  Labour will promote choice in pension provision. We will support and strengthen the framework for occupational pensions. Personal pensions, appropriately regulated, will remain a good option for many. Labour will retain SERPS as an option for those who wish to remain within it. We will also seek to develop the administrative structure of SERPS so as to create a 'citizenship pension' for those who assume responsibility as carers, as a result lose out on the pension entitlements they would otherwise acquire, and currently end up on means-tested benefits.  We overcame government opposition to pension splitting between women and men on divorce. We will implement this in government.  We aim to provide real security for families through a modern system of community care. As people grow older, their need for care increases. The Conservative approach is to promote private insurance and privatisation of care homes. But private insurance will be inaccessible to most people. And their policy for residential homes is dogmatic and will not work. We believe that local authorities should be free to develop a mix of public and private care.  We recognise the immense amount of care provision undertaken by family members, neighbours and friends. It was a Labour MP who piloted the 1995 Carers Act through Parliament. We will establish a Royal Commission to work out a fair system for funding long-term care for the elderly. We will introduce a 'long-term care charter' defining the standard of services which people are entitled to expect from health, housing and social services. We are committed to an independent inspection and regulation service for residential homes, and domiciliary care.  Everyone is entitled to dignity in retirement. Under the Tories, the earnings link for state pensions has been ended, VAT on fuel has been imposed, SERPS has been undermined and community care is in tatters. We will set up a review of the central areas of insecurity for elderly people: all aspects of the basic pension and its value, second pensions including SERPS, and community care. The review will ensure that the views of pensioners are heard. Our watchword in developing policy for pensions and long-term care will be to build consensus among all interested parties.  We will help you get more out of life  Every government department a 'green' department  Efficient and clean transport for all  New arts and science talent fund for young people  Reform the lottery  Improve life in rural areas  Back World Cup bid  The millennium is the time to reaffirm our responsibility to protect and enhance our environment so that the country we hand on to our children and our grandchildren is a better place in which to live. It also provides a natural opportunity to celebrate and improve the contribution made by the arts, culture and sport to our nation. We need a new and dynamic approach to the 'creative economy'. The Department of National Heritage will develop a strategic vision that matches the real power and energy of British arts, media and cultural industries.  Protecting the environment  Our generation, and generations yet to come, are dependent on the integrity of the environment. No one can escape unhealthy water, polluted air or adverse climate change. And just as these problems affect us all, so we must act together to tackle them. No responsible government can afford to take risks with the future: the cost is too high. So it is our duty to act now.  The foundation of Labour's environmental approach is that protection of the environment cannot be the sole responsibility of any one department of state. All departments must promote policies to sustain the environment. And Parliament should have an environmental audit committee to ensure high standards across government.  Throughout this manifesto, there are policies designed to combine environmental sustainability with economic and social progress. They extend from commitments at local level to give communities enhanced control over their environments, to initiatives at international level to ensure that all countries are contributing to the protection of the environment.  A sustainable environment requires above all an effective and integrated transport policy at national, regional and local level that will provide genuine choice to meet people's transport needs. That is what we will establish and develop.  Railways  The process of rail privatisation is now largely complete. It has made fortunes for a few, but has been a poor deal for the taxpayer. It has fragmented the network and now threatens services. Our task will be to improve the situation as we find it, not as we wish it to be. Our overriding goal must be to win more passengers and freight on to rail. The system must be run in the public interest with higher levels of investment and effective enforcement of train operators' service commitments. There must be convenient connections, through-ticketing and accurate travel information for the benefit of all passengers.  To achieve these aims, we will establish more effective and accountable regulation by the rail regulator; we will ensure that the public subsidy serves the public interest; and we will establish a new rail authority, combining functions currently carried out by the rail franchiser and the Department of Transport, to provide a clear, coherent and strategic programme for the development of the railways so that passenger expectations are met.  The Conservative plan for the wholesale privatisation of London Underground is not the answer. It would be a poor deal for the taxpayer and passenger alike. Yet again, public assets would be sold off at an under-valued rate. Much-needed investment would be delayed. The core public responsibilities of the Underground would be threatened.  Labour plans a new public/private partnership to improve the Underground, safeguard its commitment to the public interest and guarantee value for money to taxpayers and passengers.  Road transport  A balanced transport system must cater for all the familiar modes of transport: cars - whether owned, leased or shared; taxis; buses; bicycles and motorcycles. All needs must be addressed in transport planning to ensure the best mix of all types of transport, offer quality public transport wherever possible and help to protect the environment.  The key to efficient bus services is proper regulation at local level, with partnerships between local councils and bus operators an essential component. There must be improved provision and enforcement of bus lanes. Better parking facilities for cars must be linked to convenient bus services to town centres.  Road safety is a high priority. Cycling and walking must be made safer, especially around schools.  We remain unpersuaded by the case for heavier, 44-tonne lorries mooted by the Conservatives. Our concern is that they would prove dangerous and damaging to the environment.  Our plans to reduce pollution include working with the automotive industry to develop 'smart', efficient and clean cars for the future, with substantially reduced emission levels. The review of vehicle excise duty to promote low-emission vehicles will be continued.  We will conduct an overall strategic review of the roads programme against the criteria of accessibility, safety, economy and environmental impact, using public/private partnerships to improve road maintenance and exploiting new technology to improve journey information.  Shipping and aviation  The Tory years have seen the near-extinction of Britain's merchant fleet. Labour will work with all concerned in shipping and ports to help develop their economic potential to the full.  The guiding objectives of our aviation strategy will be fair competition, safety and environmental standards. We want all British carriers to be able to compete fairly in the interests of consumers.  Life in our countryside  Labour recognises the special needs of people who live and work in rural areas. The Conservatives do not. Public services and transport services in rural areas must not be allowed to deteriorate. The Conservatives have tried to privatise the Post Office. We opposed that, in favour of a public Post Office providing a comprehensive service. Conservative plans would mean higher charges for letters and put rural post offices under threat.  We favour a moratorium on large-scale sales of Forestry Commission land. We recognise that the countryside is a great natural asset, a part of our heritage which calls for careful stewardship. This must be balanced, however, with the needs of people who live and work in rural areas.  The total failure of the Conservatives to manage the BSE crisis effectively and to secure any raising of the ban on British beef has wreaked havoc on the beef and dairy industries. The cost to the taxpayer so far is £3.5 billion.  Labour aims to reform the Common Agricultural Policy to save money, to support the rural economy and enhance the environment.  Our initiatives to link all schools to the information superhighway will ensure that children in rural areas have access to the best educational resources.  Our policies include greater freedom for people to explore our open countryside. We will not, however, permit any abuse of a right to greater access.  We will ensure greater protection for wildlife. We have advocated new measures to promote animal welfare, including a free vote in Parliament on whether hunting with hounds should be banned by legislation.  Angling is Britain's most popular sport. Labour's anglers' charter affirms our long-standing commitment to angling and to the objective of protecting the aquatic environment.  Arts and culture  The arts, culture and sport are central to the task of recreating the sense of community, identity and civic pride that should define our country. Yet we consistently undervalue the role of the arts and culture in helping to create a civic society - from amateur theatre to our art galleries.  Art, sport and leisure are vital to our quality of life and the renewal of our economy. They are significant earners for Britain. They employ hundreds of thousands of people. They bring millions of tourists to Britain every year, who will also be helped by Labour's plans for new quality assurance in hotel accommodation.  We propose to set up a National Endowment for Science and the Arts to sponsor young talent. NESTA will be a national trust - for talent rather than buildings - for the 21st century. NESTA will be partly funded by the lottery; and artists who have gained high rewards from their excellence in the arts and wish to support young talent will be encouraged to donate copyright and royalties to NESTA.  Sport  A Labour government will take the lead in extending opportunities for participation in sports; and in identifying sporting excellence and supporting it.  School sports must be the foundation. We will bring the government's policy of forcing schools to sell off playing fields to an end. We will provide full backing to the bid to host the 2006 football World Cup in England. A Labour government will also work to bring the Olympics and other major international sporting events to Britain.  A people's lottery  The lottery has been a financial success. But there has been no overall strategy for the allocation of monies; and no co-ordination among the five distributor bodies about the projects deserving to benefit from lottery funding. For example, the multi-million-pound expenditure on the Churchill papers caused national outrage. A Labour government will review the distribution of lottery proceeds to ensure that there is the widest possible access to the benefits of lottery revenues throughout the UK.  Labour has already proposed a new millennium commission to commence after the closure of the Millennium Exhibition, to provide direct support for a range of education, environment and public health projects, including those directed at children's play, a project currently excluded from lottery benefit.  Because the lottery is a monopoly intended to serve the public interest, it must be administered efficiently and economically. When the current contract runs out, Labour will seek an efficient not-for-profit operator to ensure that the maximum sums go to good causes.  Media and broadcasting  Labour aims for a thriving, diverse media industry, combining commercial success and public service. We will ensure that the BBC continues to be a flagship for British creativity and public service broadcasting, but we believe that the combination of public and private sectors in competition is a key spur to innovation and high standards. The regulatory framework for media and broadcasting should reflect the realities of a far more open and competitive economy, and enormous technological advance, for example with digital television. Labour will balance sensible rules, fair regulation and national and international competition, so maintaining quality and diversity for the benefit of viewers.  Citizens' service for a new millennium  An independent and creative voluntary sector, committed to voluntary activity as an expression of citizenship, is central to our vision of a stakeholder society. We are committed to developing plans for a national citizens' service programme, to tap the enthusiasm and commitment of the many young people who want to make voluntary contributions in service of their communities. The millennium should harness the imagination of all those people who have so much to offer for the benefit of the community. We do not believe programmes should be imposed from the top down, but on the contrary wish to encourage a broad range of voluntary initiatives devised and developed by people within their own communities.  We will clean up politics  End the hereditary principle in the House of Lords  Reform of party funding to end sleaze  Devolved power in Scotland and Wales  Elected mayors for London and other cities  More independent but accountable local government  Freedom of information and guaranteed human rights  The Conservatives seem opposed to the very idea of democracy. They support hereditary peers, unaccountable quangos and secretive government. They have debased democracy through their MPs who have taken cash for asking questions in the House of Commons. They are opposed to the development of decentralised government. The party which once opposed universal suffrage and votes for women now says our constitution is so perfect that it cannot be improved.  Our system of government is centralised, inefficient and bureaucratic. Our citizens cannot assert their basic rights in our own courts. The Conservatives are afflicted by sleaze and prosper from secret funds from foreign supporters. There is unquestionably a national crisis of confidence in our political system, to which Labour will respond in a measured and sensible way.  A modern House of Lords  The House of Lords must be reformed. As an initial, self-contained reform, not dependent on further reform in the future, the right of hereditary peers to sit and vote in the House of Lords will be ended by statute. This will be the first stage in a process of reform to make the House of Lords more democratic and representative. The legislative powers of the House of Lords will remain unaltered.  The system of appointment of life peers to the House of Lords will be reviewed. Our objective will be to ensure that over time party appointees as life peers more accurately reflect the proportion of votes cast at the previous general election. We are committed to maintaining an independent cross-bench presence of life peers. No one political party should seek a majority in the House of Lords.  A committee of both Houses of Parliament will be appointed to undertake a wide-ranging review of possible further change and then to bring forward proposals for reform.  We have no plans to replace the monarchy.  An effective House of Commons  We believe the House of Commons is in need of modernisation and we will ask the House to establish a special Select Committee to review its procedures. Prime Minister's Questions will be made more effective. Ministerial accountability will be reviewed so as to remove recent abuses. The process for scrutinising European legislation will be overhauled.  The Nolan recommendations will be fully implemented and extended to all public bodies. We will oblige parties to declare the source of all donations above a minimum figure: Labour does this voluntarily and all parties should do so. Foreign funding will be banned. We will ask the Nolan Committee to consider how the funding of political parties should be regulated and reformed.  We are committed to a referendum on the voting system for the House of Commons. An independent commission on voting systems will be appointed early to recommend a proportional alternative to the first-past-the-post system.  At this election, Labour is proud to be making major strides to rectify the under-representation of women in public life.  Open government  Unnecessary secrecy in government leads to arrogance in government and defective policy decisions. The Scott Report on arms to Iraq revealed Conservative abuses of power. We are pledged to a Freedom of Information Act, leading to more open government, and an independent National Statistical Service.  Devolution: strengthening the Union  The United Kingdom is a partnership enriched by distinct national identities and traditions. Scotland has its own systems of education, law and local government. Wales has its language and cultural traditions. We will meet the demand for decentralisation of power to Scotland and Wales, once established in referendums.  Subsidiarity is as sound a principle in Britain as it is in Europe. Our proposal is for devolution not federation. A sovereign Westminster Parliament will devolve power to Scotland and Wales. The Union will be strengthened and the threat of separatism removed.  As soon as possible after the election, we will enact legislation to allow the people of Scotland and Wales to vote in separate referendums on our proposals, which will be set out in white papers. These referendums will take place not later than the autumn of 1997. A simple majority of those voting in each referendum will be the majority required. Popular endorsement will strengthen the legitimacy of our proposals and speed their passage through Parliament.  For Scotland we propose the creation of a parliament with law-making powers, firmly based on the agreement reached in the Scottish Constitutional Convention, including defined and limited financial powers to vary revenue and elected by an additional member system. In the Scottish referendum we will seek separate endorsement of the proposal to create a parliament, and of the proposal to give it defined and limited financial powers to vary revenue. The Scottish parliament will extend democratic control over the responsibilities currently exercised administratively by the Scottish Office. The responsibilities of the UK Parliament will remain unchanged over UK policy, for example economic, defence and foreign policy.  The Welsh assembly will provide democratic control of the existing Welsh Office functions. It will have secondary legislative powers and will be specifically empowered to reform and democratise the quango state. It will be elected by an additional member system.  Following majorities in the referendums, we will introduce in the first year of the Parliament legislation on the substantive devolution proposals outlined in our white papers.  Good local government  Local decision-making should be less constrained by central government, and also more accountable to local people. We will place on councils a new duty to promote the economic, social and environmental well-being of their area. They should work in partnership with local people, local business and local voluntary organisations. They will have the powers necessary to develop these partnerships. To ensure greater accountability, a proportion of councillors in each locality will be elected annually. We will encourage democratic innovations in local government, including pilots of the idea of elected mayors with executive powers in cities.  Although crude and universal council tax capping should go, we will retain reserve powers to control excessive council tax rises.  Local business concerns are critical to good local government. There are sound democratic reasons why, in principle, the business rate should be set locally, not nationally. But we will make no change to the present system for determining the business rate without full consultation with business.  The funnelling of government grant to Conservative-controlled Westminster speaks volumes about the unfairness of the current grant system. Labour is committed to a fair distribution of government grant.  The basic framework, not every detail, of local service provision must be for central government. Councils should not be forced to put their services out to tender, but will be required to obtain best value. We reject the dogmatic view that services must be privatised to be of high quality, but equally we see no reason why a service should be delivered directly if other more efficient means are available. Cost counts but so does quality.  Every council will be required to publish a local performance plan with targets for service improvement, and be expected to achieve them. The Audit Commission will be given additional powers to monitor performance and promote efficiency. On its advice, government will where necessary send in a management team with full powers to remedy failure.  Labour councils have been at the forefront of environmental initiatives under Local Agenda 21, the international framework for local action arising from the 1992 Earth Summit. A Labour government will encourage all local authorities to adopt plans to protect and enhance their local environment.  Local government is at the sharp end of the fight against deprivation. Ten years after the Conservatives promised to improve the inner cities, poverty and social division afflict towns and outer estates alike. A Labour government will join with local government in a concerted attack against the multiple causes of social and economic decline - unemployment, bad housing, crime, poor health and a degraded environment.  London  London is the only Western capital without an elected city government. Following a referendum to confirm popular demand, there will be a new deal for London, with a strategic authority and a mayor, each directly elected. Both will speak up for the needs of the city and plan its future. They will not duplicate the work of the boroughs, but take responsibility for London-wide issues - economic regeneration, planning, policing, transport and environmental protection. London-wide responsibility for its own government is urgently required. We will make it happen.  The regions of England  The Conservatives have created a tier of regional government in England through quangos and government regional offices. Meanwhile local authorities have come together to create a more co-ordinated regional voice. Labour will build on these developments through the establishment of regional chambers to co-ordinate transport, planning, economic development, bids for European funding and land use planning.  Demand for directly elected regional government so varies across England that it would be wrong to impose a uniform system. In time we will introduce legislation to allow the people, region by region, to decide in a referendum whether they want directly elected regional government. Only where clear popular consent is established will arrangements be made for elected regional assemblies. This would require a predominantly unitary system of local government, as presently exists in Scotland and Wales, and confirmation by independent auditors that no additional public expenditure overall would be involved. Our plans will not mean adding a new tier of government to the existing English system.  Real rights for citizens  Citizens should have statutory rights to enforce their human rights in the UK courts. We will by statute incorporate the European Convention on Human Rights into UK law to bring these rights home and allow our people access to them in their national courts. The incorporation of the European Convention will establish a floor, not a ceiling, for human rights. Parliament will remain free to enhance these rights, for example by a Freedom of Information Act.  We will seek to end unjustifiable discrimination wherever it exists. For example, we support comprehensive, enforceable civil rights for disabled people against discrimination in society or at work, developed in partnership with all interested parties.  Labour will undertake a wide-ranging review both of the reform of the civil justice system and Legal Aid. We will achieve value for money for the taxpayer and the consumer. A community legal service will develop local, regional and national plans for the development of Legal Aid according to the needs and priorities of regions and areas. The key to success will be to promote a partnership between the voluntary sector, the legal profession and the Legal Aid Board.  Every country must have firm control over immigration and Britain is no exception. All applications, however, should be dealt with speedily and fairly. There are, rightly, criteria for those who want to enter this country to join husband or wife. We will ensure that these are properly enforced. We will, however, reform the system in current use to remove the arbitrary and unfair results that can follow from the existing 'primary purpose' rule. There will be a streamlined system of appeals for visitors denied a visa.  The system for dealing with asylum seekers is expensive and slow - there are many undecided cases dating back beyond 1993. We will ensure swift and fair decisions on whether someone can stay or go, control unscrupulous immigration advisors and crack down on the fraudulent use of birth certificates.  Northern Ireland  Labour's approach to the peace process has been bipartisan. We have supported the recent agreements between the two governments - the Anglo-Irish Agreement, the Downing Street Declaration and the Framework Document. The government has tabled proposals which include a new devolved legislative body, as well as cross-border co-operation and continued dialogue between the two governments.  There will be as great a priority attached to seeing that process through with Labour as under the Conservatives, in co-operation with the Irish government and the Northern Ireland parties. We will expect the same bipartisan approach from a Conservative opposition.  We will take effective measures to combat the terrorist threat.  There is now general acceptance that the future of Northern Ireland must be determined by the consent of the people as set out in the Downing Street Declaration. Labour recognises that the option of a united Ireland does not command the consent of the Unionist tradition, nor does the existing status of Northern Ireland command the consent of the Nationalist tradition. We are therefore committed to reconciliation between the two traditions and to a new political settlement which can command the support of both. Labour will help build trust and confidence among both Nationalist and Unionist traditions in Northern Ireland by acting to guarantee human rights, strengthen confidence in policing, combat discrimination at work and reduce tensions over parades. Labour will also foster economic progress and competitiveness in Northern Ireland, so as to reduce unemployment.  We will give Britain leadership in Europe  Referendum on single currency  Lead reform of the EU  Retain Trident: strong defence through NATO  A reformed United Nations  Helping to tackle global poverty  Britain, though an island nation with limited natural resources, has for centuries been a leader of nations. But under the Conservatives Britain's influence has waned.  With a new Labour government, Britain will be strong in defence; resolute in standing up for its own interests; an advocate of human rights and democracy the world over; a reliable and powerful ally in the international institutions of which we are a member; and will be a leader in Europe.  Our vision of Europe is of an alliance of independent nations choosing to co-operate to achieve the goals they cannot achieve alone. We oppose a European federal superstate.  There are only three options for Britain in Europe. The first is to come out. The second is to stay in, but on the sidelines. The third is to stay in, but in a leading role.  An increasing number of Conservatives, overtly or covertly, favour the first. But withdrawal would be disastrous for Britain. It would put millions of jobs at risk. It would dry up inward investment. It would destroy our clout in international trade negotiations. It would relegate Britain from the premier division of nations.  The second is exactly where we are today under the Conservatives. The BSE fiasco symbolises their failures in Europe.  The third is the path a new Labour government will take. A fresh start in Europe, with the credibility to achieve reform. We have set out a detailed agenda for reform, leading from the front during the UK presidency in the first half of 1998:  Rapid completion of the single market: a top priority for the British presidency. We will open up markets to competition; pursue tough action against unfair state aids; and ensure proper enforcement of single market rules. This will strengthen Europe's competitiveness and open up new opportunities for British firms.  High priority for enlargement of the European Union to include the countries of central and eastern Europe and Cyprus, and the institutional reforms necessary to make an enlarged Europe work more efficiently.  Urgent reform of the Common Agricultural Policy. It is costly, vulnerable to fraud and not geared to environmental protection. Enlargement and the World Trade talks in 1999 will make reform even more essential. We will seek a thorough overhaul of the Common Fisheries Policy to conserve our fish stocks in the long-term interests of the UK fishing industry.  Greater openness and democracy in EU institutions with open voting in the Council of Ministers and more effective scrutiny of the Commission by the European Parliament. We have long supported a proportional voting system for election to the European Parliament.  Retention of the national veto over key matters of national interest, such as taxation, defence and security, immigration, decisions over the budget and treaty changes, while considering the extension of Qualified Majority Voting in limited areas where that is in Britain's interests.  Britain to sign the Social Chapter. An 'empty chair' at the negotiating table is disastrous for Britain. The Social Chapter is a framework under which legislative measures can be agreed. Only two measures have been agreed - consultation for employees of large Europe-wide companies and entitlement to unpaid parental leave. Successful companies already work closely with their workforces. The Social Chapter cannot be used to force the harmonisation of social security or tax legislation and it does not cost jobs. We will use our participation to promote employability and flexibility, not high social costs.  The single currency  Any decision about Britain joining the single currency must be determined by a hard-headed assessment of Britain's economic interests. Only Labour can be trusted to do this: the Tories are riven by faction. But there are formidable obstacles in the way of Britain being in the first wave of membership, if EMU takes place on 1 January 1999. What is essential for the success of EMU is genuine convergence among the economies that take part, without any fudging of the rules. However, to exclude British membership of EMU forever would be to destroy any influence we have over a process which will affect us whether we are in or out. We must therefore play a full part in the debate to influence it in Britain's interests.  In any event, there are three pre-conditions which would have to be satisfied before Britain could join during the next Parliament: first, the Cabinet would have to agree; then Parliament; and finally the people would have to say 'Yes' in a referendum.  Strong defence through NATO  The post-Cold War world faces a range of new security challenges - proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, the growth of ethnic nationalism and extremism, international terrorism, and crime and drug trafficking. A new Labour government will build a strong defence against these threats. Our security will continue to be based on NATO.  Our armed forces are among the most effective in the world. The country takes pride in their professionalism and courage. We will ensure that they remain strong to defend Britain. But the security of Britain is best served in a secure world, so we should be willing to contribute to wider international peace and security both through the alliances to which we belong, in particular NATO and the Western European Union, and through other international organisations such as the UN and the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe.  Labour will conduct a strategic defence and security review to reassess our essential security interests and defence needs. It will consider how the roles, missions and capabilities of our armed forces should be adjusted to meet the new strategic realities. The review we propose will be foreign policy led, first assessing our likely overseas commitments and interests and then establishing how our forces should be deployed to meet them.  Arms control  A new Labour government will retain Trident. We will press for multilateral negotiations towards mutual, balanced and verifiable reductions in nuclear weapons. When satisfied with verified progress towards our goal of the global elimination of nuclear weapons, we will ensure that British nuclear weapons are included in multilateral negotiations.  Labour will work for the effective implementation of the Chemical Weapons Convention and for a strengthening of the Biological Weapons Convention. Labour will ban the import, export, transfer and manufacture of all forms of anti-personnel landmines. We will introduce an immediate moratorium on their use. Labour will not permit the sale of arms to regimes that might use them for internal repression or international aggression. We will increase the transparency and accountability of decisions on export licences for arms. And we will support an EU code of conduct governing arms sales.  We support a strong UK defence industry, which is a strategic part of our industrial base as well as our defence effort. We believe that part of its expertise can be extended to civilian use through a defence diversification agency.  Leadership in the international community  A new Labour government will use Britain's permanent seat on the Security Council to press for substantial reform of the United Nations, including an early resolution of its funding crisis, and a more effective role in peacekeeping, conflict prevention, the protection of human rights and safeguarding the global environment.  The Commonwealth provides Britain with a unique network of contacts linked by history, language and legal systems. Labour is committed to giving renewed priority to the Commonwealth in our foreign relations. We will seize the opportunity to increase trade and economic co-operation and will also build alliances with our Commonwealth partners to promote reform at the UN and common action on the global environment. Britain has a real opportunity to provide leadership to the Commonwealth when we host the heads of government meeting in Britain at the end of 1997.  Promoting economic and social development  Labour will also attach much higher priority to combating global poverty and underdevelopment. According to the World Bank, there are 1.3 billion people in the world who live in absolute poverty, subsisting on less than US$1 a day, while 35,000 children die each day from readily preventable diseases.  Labour believes that we have a clear moral responsibility to help combat global poverty. In government we will strengthen and restructure the British aid programme and bring development issues back into the mainstream of government decision-making. A Cabinet minister will lead a new department of international development.  We will shift aid resources towards programmes that help the poorest people in the poorest countries. We reaffirm the UK's commitment to the 0.7 per cent UN aid target and in government Labour will start to reverse the decline in UK aid spending.  We will work for greater consistency between the aid, trade, agriculture and economic reform policies of the EU. We will use our leadership position in the EU to maintain and enhance the position of the poorest countries during the renegotiation of the Lomé Convention.  We will support further measures to reduce the debt burden borne by the world's poorest countries and to ensure that developing countries are given a fair deal in international trade.  It is our aim to rejoin UNESCO. We will consider how this can be done most effectively and will ensure that the cost is met from savings elsewhere.  Human rights  Labour wants Britain to be respected in the world for the integrity with which it conducts its foreign relations. We will make the protection and promotion of human rights a central part of our foreign policy. We will work for the creation of a permanent international criminal court to investigate genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity.  A new environmental internationalism  Labour believes that the threats to the global climate should push environmental concerns higher up the international agenda. A Labour government will strengthen co-operation in the European Union on environmental issues, including climate change and ozone depletion. We will lead the fight against global warming, through our target of a 20 per cent reduction in carbon dioxide emissions by the year 2010.  Labour believes the international environment should be safeguarded in negotiations over international trade. We will also work for the successful negotiation of a new protocol on climate change to be completed in Japan in 1997.  Leadership, not isolation  There is a sharp division between those who believe the way to cope with global change is for nations to retreat into isolationism and protectionism, and those who believe in internationalism and engagement. Labour has traditionally been the party of internationalism. Britain cannot be strong at home if it is weak abroad. The tragedy of the Conservative years has been the squandering of Britain's assets and the loss of Britain's influence.  A new Labour government will use those assets to the full to restore Britain's pride and influence as a leading force for good in the world. With effective leadership and clear vision, Britain could once again be at the centre of international decision-making instead of at its margins.  THIS MANIFESTO CONTAINS THE DETAIL OF OUR PLANS.

"Liberal Democrats",199705,"Which party will make a real difference to my child's education? Our aim: To make Britain the world's foremost learning society by 2010. The problem: This country's education has been underfunded and undermined by repeated shifts in policy. Standards are too low, especially in core skills such as reading and maths. Britain is too low in the world league tables. Our commitment: Liberal Democrats will make education the next government's top priority. We will invest an additional £2 billion per year in education, funded by an extra 1p in the pound on the basic rate of income tax. Our first priority is to: - Give children the best start by providing high quality early years education for every 3 and 4 year-old child whose parents want it. Key priorities are to: - Increase funding for books and equipment in schools. In the first year, we will double spending on books and equipment to overcome the effect of recent cuts. - Reduce primary school class sizes so that within 5 years no child between 5 and 11 I will need to be in a class of more than 30. - Tackle the backlog of repair and maintenance to buildings with £500m additional investment over 5 years. - Boost chances for all adults to improve their skills and get better qualifications. Making the best start Early years education is the essential building block for higher standards and achievement later on. Every £1 spent on high quality under-fives education raises standards in later life and adds up to £7 of value to the nations economy. We will: - Give children the best start by providing high quality early years education for every 3 and 4 year-old child whose parents want it. This will be the first call on our £2 billion annual programme of extra investment in education. - Promote high standards in early years education. We will set minimum standards for care, curriculum and premises. We will ensure that those in early years education are supervised by qualified staff. - Provide choice in early years education. We will scrap the bureaucratic voucher scheme. We will ensure a variety of provision from a wide range of public, private and voluntary providers. - Raising standards in schools. We will raise standards in schools, especially in literacy and numeracy, which are still far too low. We will: - Improve teaching standards. We will set up a General Teaching Council, charged with improving teaching standards and making teaching a profession to be proud of again. We will provide more opportunities for professional development and reward excellence in teaching. We will help poor teachers improve, but if they cannot, we will ensure they do not continue to teach. - Encourage schools to succeed. We will strengthen the inspection system so that it helps schools and we will extend inspection to monitoring Local Education Authorities (LEAs). - Strengthen discipline in schools. We will support teachers in maintaining discipline and provide them with the means to do so - for example, by providing better access to special referral units. We will require every school to develop a policy to tackle bullying and truancy. We will launch a national Truancy Watch scheme. We will oblige LEAs to fulfil their responsibilities to educate pupils excluded or suspended from school. - Measure achievement in pupils and schools. We will give every pupil a Personal Record of Achievement which will enable them to build up a set of nationally accredited qualifications and record their other achievements. We will require schools to publish meaningful information on their standards, achievements and plans for the future. - Improve the National Curriculum. We will replace the National Curriculum with a more focused and flexible Minimum Curriculum Entitlement. We will ensure that religious education provides pupils with an understanding of the major traditions of belief in this country. - Boost literacy. We will establish special literacy programmes involving parents with teachers in a drive to ensure that 90 per cent of all pupils reach their expected reading age by 2005. Investing in schools Extra investment for well-equipped classrooms and better-maintained buildings is essential if standards are to improve. We will: - Increase funding for books and equipment in schools. In the first year, we will double spending on books and equipment to overcome the effect of recent cuts. A typical primary school of 250 pupils will get an extra £16,000. A typical secondary school of 1,000 pupils will get an extra £110,000. - Reduce primary school class sizes so that within 5 years no child between 5 and 11 will need to be in a class of more than 30. - Tackle the backlog of repairs. We will invest an additional £500 million over 5 years in repairing crumbling and unsafe buildings. - Support children with special needs. We will fully fund the implementation of the Code of Practice for Special Educational Needs. A new partnership for schools Involving parents in the education of their children and ensuring schools are supported by local communities are both essential to achieving higher standards and a better use of resources. We will: - Increase the role of parents in education. We will extend home/school/pupil links, develop home-school partnership arrangements and support parents with information and resources to help them help their child. We will require the schools inspection service to report on home-school partnerships as part of school inspections. We will promote school councils and guarantee automatic representation on governing bodies to staff and, where appropriate, students. - Open up schools to the whole community. We will encourage schools to develop courses for parents, build links with local leisure organisations to open up school sports facilities to the community and work with local businesses to provide improved computer education. - Give all schools more independence and allow them to develop their own styles and strengths. We will devolve as many powers as possible to schools and give them more control over their budgets. We will make new 'light touch' LEAs responsible for those functions that cannot be undertaken by individual schools on their own, such as coordination, planning and monitoring standards. We will bring grant-maintained schools and City Technology Colleges into this new framework and scrap the Funding Agency for Schools. Liberal Democrats are opposed to selection, but believe that decisions on this should be made by local communities through their local Councils and not by politicians at Westminster. - Recognise the valuable role of church schools in the maintained sector. We will initiate a dialogue with all the major faiths about the role they wish to play in education in the future. Where any of the major faiths wish to establish publicly funded voluntary schools we will enable them to do so, provided that they enjoy substantial community support, offer acceptable programmes of study, provide equality of opportunity and are able to deliver the Minimum Curriculum Entitlement. - Forge a new partnership with the independent sector. We will encourage independent schools to work with state schools. We will phase out the Assisted Places Scheme and use the money saved to enable LEAs, if they wish, to enter into local partnership schemes. These could include assisting the funding of pupils at independent schools. Pupils currently covered by the Assisted Places Scheme would, however, be protected until they finish their studies. We will require independent schools to offer the Minimum Curriculum Entitlement. We will extend charitable status to all schools without affecting total Council funding and maintain the VAT exemption on school fees. Extending life-long learning In the information age, education must be a life-long activity from which people can benefit anywhere and at any time, rather than being something that only happens in school. We will: - Widen access to further education. We will give every person an Individual Learning Account as the basis for life-long post-school education with contributions made by the state, individuals and employers. Our aim is that the state contribution will be at least equivalent to the cost of fees on approved courses. We will replace the Student Loans Scheme with a fair repayment scheme linked to salaries in later life. We oppose top-up fees for tuition. Our aim is to ensure that students on approved courses (including part-time courses) up to first degree level are treated equally. - Promote flexible learning. We will create a higher standard credit-based system for all post-14 courses, including the current A-levels and degree courses. We will work with the private sector to link all schools to the Information Super Highway and ensure that they have the equipment and skills to take advantage of this. - Promote training in the workplace. To support companies that invest in education and training, and to encourage others to do so, we will introduce a 2 per cent remissible levy on company payrolls. This would be deductible against the cost of providing accredited training or making contributions to the Individual Learning Account. Small businesses will be exempt. We will give Training and Enterprise Councils the leading role in forging local partnerships to meet youth training and employment needs. - Expand training opportunities for young people. Our aim is to ensure that 16-19 year-oIds receive the equivalent of at least 2 days a week education or on-the-job training. - Boost chances for all adults to improve their skills and get better qualifications. We will ensure that all adults on approved courses or training have access to financial support, either through their Individual Learning Accounts or from their employer using our new remissible training levy. - Improve the quality of tertiary courses. We will create a new Quality Council to ensure high standards and value for money in all post-16 education and training courses. - Secure academic freedom. We will ensure the funding of university teaching and research, safeguard academic freedom and standards. Which party will be best for my job and our firm? Our aim: To end the cycle of boom and bust and equip Britain's economy to compete in the global market-place. The problem: Despite the current pre-election mini-boom, the fundamentals of Britain's economy remain weak. We continue to be held back by instability in economic management, an underskilled labour force and chronic under-investment. Britain continues to consume too much and invest too little. Our commitment: Liberal Democrats will lock in economic stability, encourage saving and promote enterprise. We will raise the quality of Britain's workforce through additional investment in education and training. As part of our strategy to build a sustainable economy, we will shift the burden of taxation from employment to the depletion of natural resources. Our priorities are to: - Provide stability in economic management to encourage long-term investment. - Raise the quality of Britain's workforce and get people back to work. - Promote enterprise and small businesses. - Begin to shift taxation from jobs, wealth and goods to pollution and the depletion of natural resources. Investing in Britain's future Long-term investment and economic stability are crucial to future economic success. We will: - Secure stable prices and low interest rates. We will turn the Bank of England into a UK Reserve Bank, free from political interference. We will charge the Bank with keeping inflation low and make it accountable to Parliament for achieving this goal. Lower inflation and greater exchange rate stability can be better secured by working with Britain's European partners. The best framework for this is a single European currency and it is in Britain's interests to take part in this. However, three conditions must be met before this can happen. First, the single currency must be firmly founded on the Maastricht criteria. Second, Britain must meet those criteria. Third, the British people must have said yes' in a referendum. If these conditions for a single currency are in place, Britain should join. - Ensure responsible economic management. We will keep to the 'golden rule' of public finance: over the economic cycle, total borrowing should not exceed total investment. We will make the government accountable to Parliament for keeping to this rule, and subject it to independent monitoring. We will cut wasteful spending and ensure new spending delivers value for money. - Build up Britain's capital assets. We will distinguish between capital and current spending in the national accounting system. We will promote effective public/private investment partnerships at both national and local levels, with Councils' borrowing carefully controlled. - Put Britain's people back to work. We will enable long-term unemployed people to turn their unemployment benefits into 'working benefits' paid to an employer to recruit and train them. We will break open the poverty traps that stop unemployed people from working. Our plans for boosting investment in infrastructure, promoting small businesses and encouraging energy conservation will create hundreds of thousands of new jobs. - Invest in a highly-skilled workforce. Our investment of an additional £2 billion a year in education and training will improve skills and increase the nation's knowledge base. - Promote environmental sustainability. We will begin a long-term shift in taxation, reducing taxes on jobs, wealth and goods and shifting them to pollution and resource depletion. We will use new national indicators of progress which include measures of quality of life and environmental sustainability. - Encourage people to save. Our aim is to extend the advantages of TESSAs and PEPs to a wider range of savers by developing a new save-as-you-earn scheme. We will encourage personal and portable pension plans. Investing in enterprise Small business, enterprise and self-employment are the engine of a modern dynamic economy and a vital source of new jobs and growth. We will: - Support small and medium-sized businesses. We will encourage the banks to develop new sources of private finance, including grants, equity finance and mutual guarantee schemes. We will seek to expand the sources of 'seed-corn' capital. We will legislate for a statutory right to interest on late debt payments. We will require the banks to develop new codes of banking practice for small businesses. We will cut red tape, for example by stopping European institutions interfering where they shouldn't and by preventing Whitehall departments 'goldplating' European regulations with extra rules. We will, in the long-term, abolish the Uniform Business Rate and bring in a new, fairer local rating system. We will ensure that government purchasing gives special emphasis and easier access to small and medium-sized firms. - Boost regional and local economies. We will set up regionally-based Development Agencies to build new partnerships between small businesses, local Councils, Business Links, TECs and local Chambers of Commerce. We will encourage these bodies to come together to provide 'one-stop shops'. We will enable Councils to raise capital for local infrastructure investment, where they work in partnership with the private sector. We will encourage industrial development by promoting geographical centres of industrial excellence. - Invest in research and innovation. We will expand support for science and research by shifting government funds away from military Research and Development and into civil science and research, and improve specialist research facilities for industry. We will encourage regional technology transfer centres to bring together the resources of industry, universities and government laboratories. - Promote tourism. We will bring together the marketing and infrastructure work of government, local Councils and tourist boards. We will ensure that local communities are involved in the planning of tourist developments from the earliest stages. - Build new partnerships at work. We will give employees new rights to consultation and participation in decisions and give companies and their employees access to advice on the forms of partnership which best suit them. We will promote profit-sharing, mutual structures and employee share-ownership schemes. We will extend the benefits of the Social Chapter of the Maastricht Treaty to all UK employees, while resisting the adoption of new rules that unnecessarily harm job opportunities. - Encourage a culture of long-term business investment. We will require companies to publish information on their long-term investment achievements, including environmental performance, research and development, and training. We will introduce greater shareholder control over directors' pay and appointments. - Promote British exports. We will make export promotion and commercial activity a higher priority for British Embassies. Making Britain more competitive A competitive domestic economy is essential if British companies are to succeed in the global market. We will: - Strengthen the law on competition. We will tighten the rules on monopolies and adopt a pro-competition stance on take-overs and mergers. We will, combine the Monopolies and Mergers Commission and the Office of Fair Trading into a single powerful body, independent of government and charged with promoting competition. - Give consumers more power. We will promote the establishment of industry-wide Ombudsmen schemes to improve complaints procedures and consumer redress. We will strengthen customer guarantees, improve product standards and labelling, especially for environmental purposes, and encourage products that are easier to repair, reuse and recycle. We will insist on clear labelling for food products which include genetically modified ingredients. - Reform the privatised utilities. We will combine the existing regulators into a single Office of Utility Regulation, reporting to a Cabinet Minister responsible for consumer affairs. This new office will contain a regulatory board for each industry and will be, charged with protecting the consumer and ensuring that excess profits are used to reduce prices and increase investment in improved services. Starting with the water industry, we will encourage utilities to involve their consumers in ownership and control of their company, through mutual structures. - Reinforce consumer and investor protection. We will introduce independent regulation of financial services and improve processes for redress (e./ g./ for mis-selling). We will protect pension and life assurance savings from fraud. We will work to maintain the City of London's pre-eminence as a financial centre and promote effective international banking standards. Which party is serious about making our environment cleaner and safer? Our aim: To make clean air, pure water and a decent environment a central priority of Government. The problem: For too long, the environment has been damaged by greed and indifference. This cannot go on. From global warming to polluted rivers and asthma in children, everyone is already paying the cost of environmental damage. The longer action is delayed, the higher the cost will be. Our commitment: To save energy, cut traffic congestion, stop the unnecessary destruction of the countryside and stem the tide of pollution. Our priorities are to: - Cut taxes on things we want to encourage, like jobs, by taxing pollution instead. This will not mean more tax, it will mean taxing differently. - Build environmental objectives into every government policy. - Set tough targets to cut energy waste, reduce traffic congestion and control pollution. A greener economy Environmental protection must be built into every economic decision and every area of government policy. We will: - Set tough new targets for the reduction of traffic pollution and waste. This will help reduce global warming, cut air pollution and prevent waste. Our targets include cutting carbon dioxide emissions (the main cause of climate change) by 30 per cent from the 1990 level over the next 15 years. - Cut VAT and taxes on jobs, and make up the difference by taxing pollution instead. This will help create more jobs and a better standard of living. - Adopt a Green Action Programme. We will set targets for sustainability and biodiversity, to be met by central and local government. We will measure these by using new indicators of quality of life, progress and wealth. The Prime Minister will report to Parliament each year on the country's success in meeting these environmental targets. - Protect the local environment. We will pass stronger laws to conserve the countryside. We will cut road congestion and help local Councils make Britain's towns and cities healthier and cleaner places to live. - Improve the way environment policy is made. Environment policy is currently buried, with housing and local government, in a huge single Government Department. We will put environment and energy policy within a separate, new department and ensure that all government departments and agencies pursue environmentally-friendly policies. We will give the Environment Agency stronger powers to enforce compliance with environmental laws. Transporting people, tackling pollution Travel delays and road congestion cost billions of pounds, and pollution damages the health of millions of people. We will: - Invest in public transport by building new partnerships with the private sector. We will enable Councils to introduce road pricing in the most congested urban areas and use the money to support clean and rapid public transport, and to improve cycle and pedestrian access. We will retain London Underground in public ownership and give it the right to seek private finance for new investment without an assured government guarantee. - Treble the freight and double the number of passengers carried on Britain's railways by the year 2010. We will strengthen the powers of the rail regulators. We will require Railtrack to meet targets for greater investment and increased passenger and freight traffic. We will withhold public subsidies from Railtrack if the targets are not met and, in the case of persistent failure, use the funds to reacquire a controlling interest in Railtrack. We will provide for legislation enabling this. - Encourage people to drive more fuel-efficient cars by cutting the annual car tax, from £145 to £10 for cars up to 1600cc, over the period of the next Parliament, funded by gradually raising the duty on fuel by approximately 4 pence per litre. Under our proposals, a person with a typical family car could drive up to 23,000 miles per year and still be better off - even in rural areas, where the average motorist only drives 11,700 miles a year. We will reform tax relief on company cars to encourage smaller cars and give people new incentives to use public transport for getting to work. - Reduce the need to travel. We will reform the planning system so that people have easier access to shops, offices and facilities, and promote the use of information technology to decentralise work. Warmer homes, saving energy Official government figures show that half the energy used in Britain is wasted. This pushes up fuel bills, worsens pollution and speeds up global warming. We will: - Cut fuel bills and make homes warmer. We will launch a National Homes Insulation programme to end fuel poverty starting with the 2 million lowest income households. Our proposals will be funded by the Energy Saving Trust and the energy supply companies. This will save these households an average £85 per year and reduce global warming emissions. By contrast, cutting VAT on fuel bills to 5 per cent would save the average household only £19 per year. - Cut taxes on people by taxing pollution instead. To encourage energy saving, we will gradually introduce a 'carbon tax' on fossil fuels, using the funds raised to cut VAT and employers' National Insurance Contributions (the tax on jobs). This is a tax switch, not a tax rise, and will be phased in gradually. - Improve energy efficiency. We will bring in new minimum standards for the energy efficiency of products, buildings and vehicles. We will cut VAT on energy conservation materials to 8 per cent - the same as for energy supplies. - Promote renewable sources of energy and combined heat and power schemes. We will shift funds from nuclear research into decommissioning and nuclear waste management, and support research for renewable energy sources. We will not provide any government subsidies for nuclear generation. We support on-site dry storage of nuclear waste, pending the long-term development of safe alternatives. Nuclear stations will not be replaced at the end of their design life. Protecting Britain's heritage Britain's natural environment and heritage are being gradually destroyed. We will: - Clean up Britain's rivers and beaches and ensure that the costs of investment are spread fairly. We will require water companies to contribute to the cost of national environmental projects. We will reduce the need for new water developments by setting targets to reduce leakage and by promoting efficiency in water use. We will introduce a fairer system of charging for water and require water companies to share excess profits with their customers through rebates or investments in environmental improvements. We will end, within 10 years, discharges that cause unnecessary water pollution. - Tackle marine oil pollution. We will implement tougher rules on shipping safety and bring forward the designation of marine high risk areas. - Reform land use planning. We will make protection of the natural environment a major feature of the planning system through a new Wildlife Act. This will improve protection of National Parks, Heritage Coasts, Sites Of Special Scientific Interest and Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty. - Green the countryside. Our proposed new Countryside Management Contracts will help farmers to protect vital habitats and convert to more environmentally-friendly farming methods. We will use tax and planning reforms to protect rural areas, encouraging development on derelict land sites rather than green fields. Thinking globally, acting locally Most people understand the importance of thinking globally and acting locally. They want to play their part in protecting the environment. Government should help them do so. We will: - Encourage the manufacture of products that are easier to repair, reuse or recycle. We will introduce deposit refund schemes and back EU-wide standards for product design, energy efficiency and reuse. - Help people to choose environmentally friendly products. We will press for comprehensive and understandable EU-wide ecologically friendly and energy efficient labelling schemes. Promoting animal welfare The way a society treats animals is a measure of its civilisation. We will: - Promote animal welfare. We will set up a compulsory national dog registration scheme. We will halt the trade in endangered species as pets. We will promote and extend training and qualification for those who work with livestock. We will insist on the enforcement of maximum time limits and for transporting live animals in the EU, a stricter timetable for banning veal crates and improved rearing conditions for pigs and chickens across the EU. We will create an Animal Protection Commission to enforce animal welfare laws and improve animal welfare standards. We will ban animal testing for cosmetics, weapons and tobacco products. We will review the law in order to reduce the use of animals in scientific experiments and seek the development of alternatives. - Protect wild animals. We believe that the issues of hunting with hounds and coursing should be decided by free votes in the House of Commons. We will ban snares and leg hold traps. We will press for stronger international laws to protect endangered species. We will ban the importation of products derived from threatened wild animals. Which party will make me feel safe on the streets and secure in my home? Our aim: To give every person in Britain the security of a decent home in a safe, strong community. The problem: Crime, homelessness and insecurity now threaten the very fabric of British society. Many people feel too frightened to leave their homes. Many do not have a decent home. Our country is becoming more and more divided, our sense of community is being lost and our shared values are being undermined. Our commitment: Liberal Democrats will pursue practical measures to rebuild Britain's communities, tackle the causes of crime, reduce homelessness, and make people safer in their homes and on the streets. Our priorities are to: - Put 3,000 more police officers on the beat. - Build more affordable and secure housing. - End, by the year 2000, the scandal of people being forced to sleep rough on the streets. - Revive Britain's sense of community. Housing Boom and bust house prices, a shortage of decent homes and poor housing have wrecked the lives of millions and damaged Britain's economy. We will: - Build more houses. We will encourage partnerships between the public sector, the private sector and housing associations to build high quality homes to rent and buy. We will, within strict borrowing controls, give local authorities more powers to go directly to the market to raise finance for building new homes. We will begin the phased release of capital receipts from past sales of Council houses and allow the money to be used to build new homes. - Give financial security to all, whether they rent or own their homes. We will introduce a new Mortgage Benefit for first time buyers. They will receive this instead of Mortgage Interest Tax Relief. Those holding current mortgages will retain Mortgage Interest Tax Relief. Our aim is, over time, to merge the new Mortgage Benefit and the current Housing Benefit into one system of housing cost relief, available to those who buy or rent and focused on those most in need. - End the scandal of people being forced to sleep rough on the streets. We will ensure that by the year 2000 no one is forced to sleep on the streets. We will require every Council to set up self-funding rent deposit schemes to help homeless people take up private tenancies. We will fund more shortstay hostel places as the first rung on the ladder to permanent accommodation. - Take action to tackle homelessness and raise housing standards. We will give Councils greater power to act on unfit private housing, where the landlord has failed to do so. We will strengthen tenants' rights to repair and, in the public sector, give them rights to take part in the management and development of their homes and estates. Our Empty Homes Strategy will enable local authorities to work with, and as a last resort require, landlords to bring empty properties back into use. We will end discrimination against those under 25 by scrapping the 'shared residency rule' when assessing housing benefit. - Bring confidence back to the housing market by targeting low inflation and low interest rates. Crime and policing Crime and the fear of crime affect almost every person and every community in the country. We will: - Put 3,000 more police officers on the beat. Within one year, we will give police authorities the resources to put an extra 3,000 police officers on the beat. We will increase the time the police spend on preventing and detecting crime by reducing unnecessary paperwork and making greater use of new technologies. - Tackle youth crime. We will widen the use of schemes that require offenders to repay their debt to society and to confront the consequences of their actions. We will, where appropriate, require parents to participate in support projects where their children have been involved in juvenile crime. We will develop schemes that target disruptive children from an early age. We will reserve custodial sentences for more serious and persistent offenders. Our voluntary Citizens Service will enable young people to get directly involved in crime prevention schemes. - Strengthen the criminal justice system. We will make the justice system work more quickly and effectively and review sentencing policy. We will overhaul the Crown Prosecution Service. We will encourage the use of community sentences, as an alternative to prison, where the result is likely to be less reoffending, and use prison sentences where they are essential to public protection or to make punishment effective. We will concentrate resources on crime prevention and on increasing conviction rates, rather than spending billions on building prisons. - Focus on crime prevention. We will require Councils to take the lead in establishing cross-community partnerships against crime, setting specific targets for crime prevention. We will give Councils powers and resources to support high-quality, targeted crime prevention initiatives. - Wage war on drug abuse. We will give the Police and Customs and Excise the support they need to stop drugs coming into Britain. We will set up a Royal Commission charged with developing policies to tackle the drugs problem at its roots. - Give victims a new deal. We will promote restorative justice, under which offenders can be required to compensate victims for the damage they have caused. We will ensure that the Victim Support movement and the Witness Support schemes play a full role in the criminal justice system. We will provide victims with the practical support they need to prevent repeat attacks. - Strengthen public confidence in the police. We will make police authorities more responsive to local communities by increasing their elected membership and creating an accountable police authority for London. We will improve co operation between police forces and work more closely with Britain's European partners to combat international crime, terrorism, drug trafficking and fraud. We will ensure that the police take further steps to reduce the level of racial and homophobic violence. Rural communities Britain's rural economy and communities have been transformed over the last fifty years. The challenge for the next fifty years is to protect and enhance the richness of rural life, while developing a thriving rural economy. We will: - Seek further reform of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP). We will work to replace the CAP, which currently subsidises production, with Countryside Management Contracts - a targeted system of direct payments to support economic, social and environmental goals in rural communities. Countryside Management Contracts will enable farmers and landowners to choose from a wide range of options, for example, to improve the rural environment, maximise food quality, protect natural habitats or move to less intensive or organic farming methods. - Help rural economies through a period of change. We will, in partnership with the agriculture industry, draw up a national strategy for farming in order to provide a framework for public policy and private decision-making over the next 10 years. We will promote agricultural research and development, and assist farmers wishing to diversify. We will promote local processing of agricultural products and expand support for small and medium-sized enterprises in rural areas. - Tackle rural crime. We will put more police into rural areas, support Farm and Neighbourhood Watch schemes and give Councils the duty to set up crime prevention schemes with the local police. We will enable rural police authorities to introduce mortgage incentive schemes to encourage rural beat officers to live in the areas they serve. - Enhance rural services. We will support smaller village schools through greater use of information technology and specialist teaching teams. We will encourage schemes that enable local communities to make use of school buildings and equipment. We will promote community hospitals and use them for more out-patient consultations. - Provide more affordable rural housing. We will encourage housing authorities, Parish Councils and housing associations to set up partnership schemes with the private sector in order to build low-cost homes for first-time home buyers and social needs. - Improve rural transport. We will give local authorities the power to improve the co-ordination of local bus services and to reopen closed railway stations, in co-operation with Railtrack. - Strengthen the network of rural sub-post offices and village shops. We will encourage the Post Office to invest in new point of sale technologies, in order to provide access, through sub-post offices, to a wide range of customer services. Where post offices and village shops which are vital to their local community are threatened, we will enable local Councils to support them with up to 100 per cent rate relief. - Protect the countryside. We will help landowners meet the environmental costs of increased access to the countryside. We will take action to reduce the use of chemicals in farming. - Protect rural areas from urbanisation. We will penalise the use of greenfield sites, set and enforce targets for greater use of brownland sites and encourage over-the-shop accommodation in market town centres. We will review the excessive housing totals in the current structure plans and scrap the 'predict and provide' approach to housing development. - Work to preserve fish stocks and protect the livelihoods of local fishing communities. Our aim is to scrap the Common Fisheries Policy and replace it with a new Europe-wide fisheries policy based on the regional management of fish stocks. We will take firm action to end quota-hopping, begin the phased abolition of industrial fishing and strengthen decommissioning incentives. - Promote safe food. We will set up a Food Commission, independent from MAFF and accountable to Parliament, maintain strict controls on the use of bio-technology and press for higher common food standards across the European Union. Urban communities Britain's towns and cities offer civic pride, accessible facilities and, potentially, a high quality of life. However, many suffer from alienation, joblessness, high crime rates, a run down environment and loss of population. Urban areas should offer excitement, security and a strong sense of community. We will: - Boost local economic development and job opportunities. We will support local development corporations. We will build new partnerships between local government and the private and voluntary sectors, to regenerate local economies and promote community enterprise. We will link local training to local jobs. We will encourage the establishment of community banks and credit unions. - Tackle urban crime. We will expand community policing, ensure that all new planning takes account of the need to deter crime and focus on crime prevention. - Encourage public transport. We will enable Councils to co-ordinate bus and train services and give them powers to introduce urban road pricing schemes, using the revenue raised to invest in better public transport. - Reform and strengthen elected local government. We will give local Councils greater control over their own affairs. We will create a strategic authority for London. We will encourage the use of 'planning for real' strategies, in which local people can make a direct input into major planning projects in their community. Arts and media Flourishing arts and a diverse culture are essential for a lively and open society. They can be engines of innovation that bring life to the economy. At the same time, the world is experiencing an information revolution as important and far-reaching as the Industrial Revolution. Britain must maintain a free and effective media capable of being a check on the abuse of power, and of giving people the information they need to make informed decisions. We will: - Tackle the concentration of media power. We will act to prevent media mergers or take-overs, except where these can be shown to advance quality, diversity and access. We will require the Independent Television Commission to protect the position of smaller regional ITV companies, within the network supply agreement. - Maintain the role of the BBC as the benchmark of public service broadcasting, committed to quality, diversity and universal access. We will protect the independence and impartiality of the BBC through its Board of Governors and its licence fee. - Improve access to information technology and the Internet. We will ensure that everyone in Britain can have access, either individually or through a wide range of public access points, to a nationwide interactive communications network by the year 2000. - Increase access to the arts. We will use the National Lottery to endow, house and improve access to the arts. We aim to move towards the European average for public funding of the arts. We aim to restore the principle of free access to national museum and gallery collections, starting with the removal of charges for school parties. - Promote Britain's culture. We will promote film production in Britain. We will actively support the British Council and rejoin UNESCO. We will enhance the BBC World Service as a national asset. Which party will care for the NHS and put my patients first? Our aim: To make year-on-year improvements in the health of Britain's people and the quality of the National Health Service. The problem: The NHS has been squeezed between rising demand and government underfunding, and disrupted by repeated changes in government policy. Morale amongst NHS professionals is falling, and bureaucracy has grown at the expense of front-line patient care, while numbers of nurses and hospital beds have fallen. Our commitment: Liberal Democrats will increase funding for the NHS and secure funding for the future. We will maintain the NHS as a comprehensive service, free at the point of need and funded primarily from general taxation. We will immediately tackle the crisis in the hospital sector make the NHS more accountable and begin a long term shift towards preventive medicine. Our priorities are to: - Halt all finance driven closures for 6 months, pending an independent audit of needs and facilities. - Invest £200 million each year to recruit more staff for front-line patient care. This would be enough, for example, for 10,000 extra nurses or 5,000 extra doctors. - Cut hospital waiting lists to a maximum of 6 months over 3 years. - End the two-tier system in the NHS. - Restore free eye and dental checks. Raising standards in the NHS Whilst many of the recent reforms to the NHS have been beneficial, they have resulted in the creation of a two-tier health service. The standard of health care a person receives is increasingly becoming a lottery. The length of time people have to wait, the chance of treatment being postponed and the quality of health care vary enormously from one part of the UK to another. We will: - Match NHS facilities to needs. We will place an immediate 6-month halt on the finance driven closure of beds and wards, and set up an independent audit of needs and facilities. - End the built-in two-tier service in the NHS. We will end the present system where treatment depends on the type of GP people go to. We will treat all GPs equally, with a common basis for funding. We want all GPs to have the benefits of flexibility and access to services currently enjoyed by fundholders. Those who choose to manage their own affairs will be able to do so on their own or as part of a consortium. Those who do not will be able to leave management to the local health authority. - Raise standards of care in all areas. We will set up a National Inspectorate for Health and Social Care to improve standards and promote patients' interests. This body will work with the Audit Commission to ensure that all spending is monitored and results in real improvements in patient care. Funding the Health Service The NHS is underfunded. Too much goes into bureaucracy and not enough into patient care. There is a crisis in the NHS, especially in hospitals. Morale is dropping, standards of care are at risk from underfunding and highly qualified doctors and nurses are leaving the profession. We will: - Invest more in the NHS. We will invest at least an extra £540 million every year in the NHS to pay for our policy priorities. This will be paid for by closing the loophole that allows employers to avoid paying National Insurance contributions on certain benefits in kind and by putting 5p on the price of a packet of 20 cigarettes. We will use these extra funds to tackle the crisis in staffing, especially in the hospital sector, and begin a shift to preventive care. We will ensure that the NHS budget keeps pace with increasing cost pressures. - Shift money from unnecessary bureaucracy into patient care. We will move from annual to at least three yearly contracts between Health Authorities and Trusts, and shift the money saved into front-line patient care. We will replace time consuming local pay bargaining with a new national pay structure and a single NHS-wide Pay Review Body that covers all pay, from the cleaner to the chief executive. Building on the best of the NHS The NHS needs to be strengthened and improved. We will: - Cut waiting lists. We will cut waiting times between diagnosis and treatment to a maximum of 6 months over 3 years. - Improve the quality of care and raise morale. We will recruit and train more professional staff. Our carefully costed plans would, for instance, pay for the equivalent of 10,000 more nurses or 5,000 more doctors. We will ban the use of gagging clauses in employment contracts which prevent professional staff from speaking out against unsafe standards. - Tackle the crisis in NHS dental care. We will require local authorities to ensure that the public has access to NHS dentistry in all areas. Promoting good health Britain has a health service that concentrates too much on curing illness rather than preventing it. A healthier nation and a more cost-effective NHS depend on shifting the emphasis towards prevention, tackling the root causes of ill health (e./ g./ poverty and homelessness) and making people more responsible for their own health. We will: - Make prevention a priority. We will immediately abolish charges for eye and dental check-ups and freeze prescription charges as the first steps in a radical shift of policy that emphasises the prevention of illness rather than treatment. - Encourage people to take more responsibility for their own health. We will improve health education and promote healthy living. We will ban tobacco advertising and promotion and increase the duty on tobacco products. We will make the Health Education Authority truly independent and free to criticise government policy. - Ensure that food is healthy and safe. We will create an independent and powerful Food Commission, separate from MAFF, and responsible to Parliament for food quality and safety. - Put health promotion at the heart of government policy. We will require all government departments to assess the impact of their policies on health. Each year there will be an independent report, to be published and debated in Parliament, on the state of the nation's health. Bringing health services closer to people The local institutions of the NHS must become more accountable to those they serve and more responsive to patients' needs. We will: - Enable citizens to play a part in setting health policies in their area. We will build on current pilot schemes to bring together Health Authorities and Social Services Departments, within the framework of elected local authorities. - Give local people a stronger voice on NHS Trusts. We will end the right of the Secretary of State for Health to appoint members of NHS Trusts, Authorities and Boards. We will require at least half the membership of Trusts to be drawn from the population they serve. We will open up meetings of NHS Trust boards to the public and press, and give local people, staff and professionals speaking rights. We will guarantee direct representation from the staff of each Trust. We will give Community Health Councils improved rights to consultation and greater access to information and meetings. - Give the public more say in setting priorities within the NHS. Difficult choices about priorities must be faced. They cannot be left to bureaucrats and health professionals alone. We will develop new ways of involving the public in setting health service priorities. Giving patients more choice Patients should have more choice over their type of treatment, who delivers it and when. We will: - Enhance the rights of patients. We will strengthen the Patients' Charter and include rights to treatment within a specified time, a choice of GP, information about the options for treatment, guaranteed access to health records and better redress. - Ensure that action is taken to improve poor quality services. We will enable patients and staff to apply directly to our new National Inspectorate of Health and Social Care to carry out inspections and take action where deficiencies come to light. Community care Our aim is to create a society in which people, whatever their needs, can live their lives with dignity. We will: - Give people choice in the services they use and the way they are provided. We will require Councils to extend to those over 65 the right to arrange their own care privately, if they wish. This will promote independence and enable them to find better value for money. - Care for carers. We will introduce a new Carer's Benefit, in place of the Independent Living Allowance, in order to meet more of the financial cost of caring. We will extend the Carer's Benefit, as resources allow, to those over retirement age and work to improve advice, information, training and counselling for carers. We will seek to increase access to respite care and ensure that carers and users are involved in decisions about care. We will draw up a Charter that sets out carers' rights and responsibilities. - Establish high national standards for all community care services. Our new independent Inspectorate of Health and Social Care will publish codes of practice for residential and nursing homes, and have the power to close any home that consistently falls short of national standards. We will introduce national charging and eligibility guidelines to ensure a 'level playing field' of provision and charges. - Protect people from the excessive cost of care. We will, as resources allow, raise the threshold at which older people are required to make a contribution to their long-term care. We are committed to working on a cross party basis, to establish a national agreement on a system for funding care services that does not penalise thrift. Which party will clean up the mess in our politics? Our aim: To restore trust in British politics. The problem: People know that British politics isn't working. Their politicians have lied to them, their Parliament has become tainted by sleaze and their government is out of touch and doesn't listen. Our commitment: Liberal Democrats will modernise Britain's outdated institutions, rebuild trust, renew democracy and give Britain's nations, regions and local communities a greater say over their affairs. Our priorities are to: - Restore trust between people and government, by ending secrecy and guaranteeing peoples' rights and freedoms. - Renew Britain's democracy, by creating a fair voting system, reforming Parliament and setting higher standards for politicians' conduct. - Give government back to the people, by decentralising power to the nations, regions and communities of the United Kingdom. Restoring trust in politics British politics remains far too secretive. We cannot rebuild trust in politics without making government more open and accountable. We will: - Safeguard individual liberties, by establishing a Bill of Rights. As a first step, we will incorporate the European Convention on Human Rights into UK law so that it is enforceable by the courts in the UK. We will set up a Human Rights Commission to strengthen the protection of individual rights. We will create a Ministry for Justice responsible for protecting human rights and overseeing the administration of the legal system, the courts and legal aid. We oppose the introduction of Identity Cards. - Break open the excessive secrecy of government, by passing a Freedom of Information Act establishing a citizens right to know. - Cut back the quango state. We will scrap unnecessary quangos, handing their functions over to elected bodies. We will require those that remain to meet in public and to list their members' interests. We will establish a fair, open and more representative appointment process for all quangos. - Give people more say in decision-making. We will make greater use of national referendums for constitutional issues, for example, changing the voting system or any further transfer of power to European institutions. We will enable referendums to be held on specific local issues where there is public demand. Renewing democracy Britain's political institutions are outdated and unrepresentative. We will: - Modernise the House of Commons. We will reduce the number of MPs by 200 (one third) and introduce tougher rules for their conduct, behaviour and outside sources of income. We will improve drafting and consultation on legislation, and strengthen MPs' ability to hold the government to account. - Create an effective and democratic upper house. We will, over two Parliaments, transform the House of Lords into a predominantly elected second chamber capable of representing the nations and regions of the UK and of playing a key role in scrutinising European legislation. - Introduce a fair system of voting. We will introduce proportional representation for all elections, to put more power in the hands of voters and make government more representative. - Make politics more stable. We will establish a fixed Parliamentary term of four years. - Clean up party funding. We will reform the way political parties are funded and limit the amount they can spend on national election campaigns. We will make each party publish its accounts and list all large donors. Giving government back to the people Far too much power has been concentrated in Westminster and Whitehall. Democratic government should be as close to ordinary people as possible. We will: - Introduce Home Rule for Scotland, with the creation of a Scottish Parliament, elected by proportional representation, and able to raise and reduce income tax. - Introduce Home Rule for Wales, with the creation of a Welsh Senedd, elected by proportional representation, and able to raise and reduce income tax. - Create the framework to make existing regional decision-making in England democratically accountable, and enable the establishment of elected regional assemblies, where there is demonstrated public demand. We will create a strategic authority for London. Strengthen local government. We will establish a 'power of general competence', giving Councils wider scope for action. We will allow local authorities to raise more of their funds locally, give them greater discretion over spending and allow them, within strict limits, to go directly to the markets to raise finance for capital projects. We will, in the long-term replace Council Tax with a Local Income Tax, and replace the Uniform Business Rate with a fairer system of business rates, raised through local Councils and set in accordance with local priorities. Northern Ireland Peace in Northern Ireland depends on containing and ultimately removing the entrenched hostility between the two main communities in Northern Ireland. We will: - Establish a power-sharing executive for Northern Ireland, elected under a fair and proportional system of voting. We will press for a new constitutional settlement based on the protection of individual rights through a Bill of Rights, incorporating the European Convention. - Give individuals more power and political responsibility. We will introduce a fair and proportional voting system for all elections, and reform and strengthen local government in the province. - Ensure respect for civil liberties. We will introduce an independent procedure for investigating complaints against the security forces, and reform the Diplock system so that three judges instead of one preside over non-jury trials. We will urgently implement the North Report's recommendations for an independent commission to supervise parades and marches. - Promote economic growth. We will strengthen the all-Ireland economy through the creation of effective cross-border agencies. We will invest in education and promote inward investment. - Build on the Joint Declaration and the Framework Document, by working with the Irish Government to create agreement between as many of the constitutional parties as possible. Sinn Fein can only be admitted to this process if, in accordance with the Mitchell principles, they and the IRA turn their backs on terrorism. Meanwhile, we must remain vigilant and keep in place the present means for countering terrorism. Which party will give me the opportunity to make the most of my life? Our aim: To widen opportunities for everyone in Britain to make the most of their lives. The problem: Poverty, lack of training, low pay and discrimination deny too many people the opportunity to make the most of their lives. Meanwhile, the welfare system no longer meets the needs of a modern society. It locks too many into dependency and, too often, penalises those who wish to work and save. Our commitment: Liberal Democrats will promote individual self-reliance, strengthen equality for all before the law and in employment, and work for a society that cherishes diversity. Our priorities are to: - Ensure that, by the millennium, every young person has had the opportunity to work learn, train and make a positive contribution to society. - Give women greater opportunities to play a full role in work and in society. - Ensure dignity in retirement. - Break open the poverty trap that makes people better off on the dole than in work. - Modernise Britain's welfare state for the twenty-first century, building a new cross-party partnership for reform. Breaking the poverty trap Unemployment wastes the talents and denies people the opportunity to contribute to the well-being of their families and increase Britain's wealth. We will: - Help long-term unemployed people back to work. We will establish a self-financing Benefit Transfer Programme allowing those who have been unemployed for a year or more to turn their unemployment benefits into an incentive for employers to recruit and train them. The value of the benefit to employers will gradually be reduced. - Break open the poverty trap. We will take nearly 500,000 low earners out of income tax altogether by raising tax thresholds. This will provide lower taxes and new incentives to work, while cutting the benefits bill and reducing tax for 99. 5 per cent of all income taxpayers. This will be paid for by introducing a new top tax rate of 5Op on taxable income of over £100,000 per year. We will replace Income Support and Family Credit with a simpler, more efficient Low Income Benefit that increases financial incentives for people going back to work. - Modernise Britain's welfare system. We will initiate a comprehensive review of the welfare system to build a new framework for welfare and opportunity, on a cross-party basis. Our aim is to provide a more effective safety net for the disadvantaged, to encourage work, without compulsion, and to widen opportunities. - Help parents to return to work. We will develop a national childcare strategy, drawing on public and private provision. We will, over time, extend tax relief on workplace nurseries to other forms of day nursery care. - Establish a voluntary Citizens Service to give people, especially young people, up to 2 years' work on such projects as environmental conservation, crime prevention, housing renovation, social services and the armed services. - Encourage a flexible labour market, while protecting the low paid with a regionally variable, minimum hourly rate. - Crack down on social security fraud and tax evasion and shift the money saved into new policies to enhance opportunities. We will tackle the high levels of fraud and overpayment in the social security budget. We will stop tax evasion and close off tax avoidance loopholes. Older people Everyone in Britain should be able to look forward to a retirement of security, opportunity and dignity. Old people feel that they are fast becoming Britain's forgotten generation. We will: - Guarantee everyone an acceptable minimum standard of living in retirement. We will create an additional top-up pension for pensioners with incomes below the Income Support level. This will be indexed to earnings and tapered as outside income increases. The basic state pension will remain indexed to prices. We will start to phase out the expensive, unfair contributory system and base the right to a state pension on citizenship and residence. - Enable people to choose when to start drawing a pension. We will bring in a flexible 'decade of retirement', between the ages of 60 and 70. - Protect the rights of older people. We will legislate against discrimination on the grounds of age. - Expand private pensions and give people more control over their pensions. We wish to see more people making provision for their old age. We will replace the State Earnings Related Scheme (SERPS) with a scheme under which all employees have personal or occupational pensions. Existing accrued SERPS will, however, be preserved. We will expand occupational and personal pension schemes by giving all employees an entitlement to participate in a pension scheme of their choice, funded by contributions from employers and employees. Pension rights will be fully secured if people change jobs. We will treat pensions as deferred income over which pension-holders have full rights of security, control and portability. - Abolish standing charges for water and create a fairer system of charging. Young people We propose a new deal for young people, in which new rights and new responsibilities go hand in hand. We will: - Expand opportunities. Our aim is that every young person between the ages of 16 and 19 will have the opportunity to either work, learn, train or take a place on our new Citizens Service. - Restore security to excluded young people. The withdrawal of benefit rights has condemned thousands of young people to life out of work and on the streets, at great long-term public cost. We will restore access to benefits for 16 and 17 year-olds. In the longer term, we aim to scrap the lower rate of income support for those under 25. - Ensure that young people can learn their rights and responsibilities, with citizenship classes in every school and parenting classes for young adults. We will give children and young people access to information about their legal rights and obligations, review the age of majority and ensure that young people are represented on bodies that especially concern them. - Expand local youth services. We will require local Councils to provide a statutory youth service in partnership with the voluntary sector Families Families, in all their forms, are a basic building block of society. But the nature of families is changing. This has brought new stresses which must be addressed. But it has also brought new attitudes, such as the sharing of family responsibilities, which should be encouraged. We will: - Give families more security. We will take nearly 500,000 low earners out of tax altogether, by raising tax thresholds. We will replace Income Support and Family Credit with a simpler, more efficient Low Income Benefit that helps people back to work. We aim to improve the support for those caring for older people and people with disabilities. - Introduce fair and workable child support legislation. We will repeal the Child Support Act and abolish the Child Support Agency. We believe that parents should financially support their children at an appropriate level. Where there are disputes between the parents, these should be decided by the courts, not by an inflexible formula. We will create a new system of unified family courts to decide these questions, after they have heard all the evidence. - Promote good parenting. We will encourage the provision of parenting classes for young adults. We will increase the role of parents in education by extending home/school/pupil links, and develop home-school partnership arrangements, to assist in addressing the needs of the child. - Expand parental rights. We will introduce a statutory right to parental leave and develop Maternity Benefit into a new, flexible parental benefit to be shared between partners. We will ensure that fostering and adoption law is based on the suitability of prospective fosterers and the needs of the child. - Help parents to return to work. We will, over time, extend tax relief on workplace nurseries to other forms of day nursery care. We will develop a national childcare strategy, drawing on public and private provision. - Encourage flexible working patterns. We will encourage job sharing and family-friendly employment practices, especially in the public sector. We will give private sector employees approaching retirement age, or with responsibili201ties for young children, the right to negotiate reduced hours or a career break. Women There is still a long way to go before women in Britain have equal opportunities. We will: - Promote equality in the workplace. We will, over time, extend employment and pensions rights to part-time employees, on a pro-rata basis. We will bring in tougher obligations on employers to establish equal opportunities procedures and pursue the principle of equal pay for work of equal value. - Make pensions fairer to women, by working to replace the contributory system with pension rights based on citizenship and residence in the UK. We will bring forward the introduction of pension splitting on divorce. - Improve the services that women receive from the NHS. We will promote equal treatment of the sexes within the Health Service. We will set targets for the expansion of facilities which enable women to consult female health professionals. - Make the legal system fairer to women. We will strengthen the civil law remedies for domestic violence and improve the treatment of rape victims by the court system. We will seek to improve the provision of refuge places for victims of domestic violence. - Enhance the role of women in public life. We will tackle the under-representation of women on public bodies by setting a target that within a decade at least one-third of all those on all public bodies should be women. We will reform the procedures and facilities of the House of Commons to make them more accommodating to women and families. Disabled people Progress in equal opportunities for disabled people remains patchy and unacceptably slow. We will: - Guarantee the rights of disabled people. We will ban discrimination on the grounds of disability and pass comprehensive legislation securing the civil rights of disabled people. We will draw up a Charter of Rights setting out what our new Bill of Rights means for disabled people. - Give disabled people more independence. We will introduce a Partial Capacity Benefit, building on the Disability Working Allowance, to assist those in work who cannot fully support themselves financially. We aim to increase financial support for disabled people who cannot find work and to make provision for the real costs of disability. - Improve access. We will publish a code of practice to improve access to buildings and transport. We will require government departments, local Councils and public organisations to make their key public literature available in Braille or where appropriate tape. - Make education inclusive. As part of our £2 billion investment in education, we will increase funding for, and enforce implementation of, the Code of Practice for Special Educational Needs. Ethnic minorities Despite progress over recent years, members of ethnic minorities are too often denied equal opportunities and have to face racism and discrimination on a daily basis. Diversity, pluralism and a multicultural society are sources of strength for Britain. We will: - Strengthen action against discrimination. We will create a new Human Rights Commission, combining the Commission for Racial Equality and the Equal Opportunities Commission. We will give statutory force to the Commission for Racial Equality's Code of Practice in employment, and ensure that Britain plays a leading role in strengthening anti-discrimination legislation throughout the European Union. - Ensure equal opportunities for all. We will require local authorities and housing associations to ensure equal opportunities in housing allocation. We will expand access to mother-tongue teaching, for both adults and children, where this takes place through self-help and community groups. - Free immigration laws from racial discrimination. We will ensure that immigration policy is non-discriminatory in its application. We will reform current immigration laws so as to enable genuine family reunions. We will restore benefit rights to asylum seekers and ensure that asylum claims are dealt with swiftly. - Increase ethnic minorities' confidence in the police. We will encourage the recruitment of ethnic minorities into the police force and require action to be taken against discrimination within the force. We will tackle any discriminatory use of police powers, such as stop and search, and enhance police action to deal with racial attacks. We will encourage the use of aggravated sentencing for racially motivated crimes. Lesbians and gay men In a free and tolerant society, discrimination on any grounds is unacceptable. Diversity is a source of strength. We will: - Ensure equality before the law for lesbians and gay men through our new Human Rights Commission and the Bill of Rights. We will create a common age of consent regardless of gender or sexual orientation. - Stop discrimination. We will outlaw incitement to hatred and discrimination in housing and employment, including the armed forces, on grounds of sexual orientation. We will repeal 'section 28' of the 1988 Local Government Act. We will reform the law, ensure that the police and local authorities deal more effectively with homophobic attacks, and encourage police forces to be more representative of the communities they serve. Which party has the vision to build the kind of world I want to live in? Our aim: To recast Britain's foreign policy and enable this country to play a leading role in shaping Europe and strengthening international institutions. The problem: For too long British foreign policy has looked backwards to its imperial past. Britain's interests have been damaged by an attitude to Europe that has been, at best, ambivalent and, at worst, hostile. This attitude has also cost Britain opportunities for influence and advantage. Our commitment: Liberal Democrats will ensure that Britain plays a leading role in shaping Europe, democratising its institutions and strengthening its role as a framework for prosperity, peace and security. Britain, with its world experience, expert armed forces and permanent membership of the UN Security Council, has a unique role to play in reforming international institutions for the next century. Our priorities are to: - Make the European Union (EU) work more effectively and democratise its institutions. - Widen Europe to include the new democracies of central and eastern Europe. - Create a strong framework for Britain's defence and security through NATO and European co-operation. - Give Britain a leading role in reforming and strengthening the UN and other international institutions. - Promote an enforceable framework for international law, human rights and the protection of the environment. Positive leadership in Europe Britain's interests can only best be pursued through constructive participation in an enlarged European Union. Our vision is of a European Union that is decentralised, democratic and diverse. A strong and united Europe, but one that respects cultural traditions and national and regional identities. In seeking to reform the EU, our priorities are to: - Give the British people a say. Reform that fundamentally changes Britain's place in Europe should only proceed if it has the explicit support of Britain's people. If there is any substantial change in Britain's relationship with the EU, the British people must give their consent through a referendum. - Make EU institutions more democratic and accountable. We will give the House of Commons a more effective role in scrutinising European policy. We also want the Council of Ministers and the EC Commission to be more accountable to the elected European Parliament. We will introduce a fair and proportional voting system for British MEPs in time for the 1999 European Parliament elections. - Make EU decision-making more efficient and effective. Europe cannot effectively enlarge without improving its decision-making. We therefore favour the wider application of majority voting. But we will keep the veto on all issues relating to the constitution, budgetary matters and regulations on pay and social security. We support the use of the double majority', especially on matters such as foreign and security policy. Each member state must retain the unfettered right to make its own decisions on the commitment of its national troops. Pursuing Britain's interests in Europe Britain has much to gain from EU membership. This will take new leadership, a new approach and a renewed sense of national confidence. Our aims in Europe are to: - Enhance economic prosperity, by promoting the freedom of movement of people, goods, services and money throughout the EU and by completing the European Single Market, particularly in areas of financial services, pensions and air travel. - Participate in a successful single currency. Being part of a successful single currency will bring low inflation and low interest rates. Staying out will result in less investment and a loss of influence. However, three conditions must be met before Britain can join. First, the single currency must be firmly founded on the Maastricht criteria. Second, Britain must meet those criteria. Third, the British people must have agreed to it in a referendum. - Strengthen the European framework for peace and security. Britain's security and national interests are best pursued in partnership with its European neighbours. We will work to strengthen European Common Foreign and Security policy to enable greater scope for united European action. Individual member states must be free to decide whether or not their national forces will take part in any particular action. - Fight crime and protect citizens' rights through more effective co-operation between EU states' police and customs forces with greater democratic accountability. We will work to improve European co-operation against cross-border criminal activity and allow free movement for Britain's people throughout Europe. The administration of border controls should remain with individual member nations until they can be confident that the EU's external borders are secure. - Reform the Common Agricultural Policy, converting it into a system of direct payments to support economic, social and environmental goals in rural communities. - Reform fisheries policies, scrapping the Common Fisheries Policy and replacing it with a new Europe-wide fisheries policy based on the regional management of fish stocks. We will take urgent action to end quota-hopping and begin the phased abolition of industrial fishing. Strong defence in an uncertain world The first decades of the next century are likely to be turbulent and unstable everywhere, including within and around Europe. Britain must maintain an effective security capability. This will best be achieved through NATO and European co-operation, and this country must continue to play a full part in both. We will: - Maintain a strong defence at home and enable the UK to play a leading role in keeping international peace. We will maintain Britain's overall defence capability at its current level, whilst ensuring UK forces meet current needs and are appropriate to potential threats. - Retain Britain's basic nuclear capability through the Trident submarine force until such time as international multilateral nuclear disarmament can be achieved. We will restrict the number of nuclear warheads on Trident to the same number as previously deployed on Polaris. - Resist the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. We will press for the conclusion of a verifiable Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. We will ensure that Britain plays an active part in talks to reduce the holdings of strategic nuclear weapons. - Support the principle of common security. We support the extension of the security guarantees, from which western Europe has benefited, to the new democracies of central and eastern Europe. We support NATO and its enlargement. Working for peace, security and sustainability In an increasingly inter-dependent world, the security of a medium sized nation like Britain is best preserved within a framework of international law that is effective and enforceable. Reforming the United Nations Playing a leading role in strengthening and reforming the United Nations should be a central aspect of Britain's foreign policy over the next decade. We will work to: - Strengthen the UN's peacekeeping capability so that it can take earlier and more effective action to prevent or suppress conflict. This should include establishing fast track machinery for negotiations; permanent, on-call, peacekeeping forces made up from high-calibre troops provided by member states; the reinstatement of a Military Staff Committee; the establishment of a UN Staff College to train officers; and improvements to the UN's command control, communication and intelligence capabilities. - Support the establishment of an International Criminal Court to deal with genocide and war crimes. Protecting the global environment Pollution and environmental degradation do not respect national borders. Countries must work together if the world's environment is to be protected. We will: - Take a lead in international environmental negotiations. We will press for tough and legally binding international targets for greenhouse gas emissions and other pollutants. - Develop a global system of environmental protection. We will work for the creation of a global environmental organisation. We will promote an environmental equivalent of the Geneva Convention, to outlaw gross acts of environmental destruction in times of war Tackling world poverty The elimination of global famine, pestilence and poverty is not only a moral challenge, it is also essential for the world's long-term stability and peace. We will: - Increase Britain's contribution to overseas aid. We will set out a timetable for sustained progress towards achieving the UN target for overseas development aid of 0./7 per cent of GNP within the next 10 years. - Promote a timetable for debt relief to the poorest states including a programme for cancelling debt and the creation of new and additional resources for debt relief. - Target Britain's bilateral aid where it is most needed. We will focus Britain's bilateral aid on the least developed countries and end the practice of tying aid. - Require states that receive UK development assistance to respect the fundamental human rights of their people and suspend UK programmes where these standards are breached. Controlling arms sales The global arms trade fuels conflicts, hinders prosperity and robs the world's poor of resources. Its growth must be diminished. We will: - End the sale of British arms, war material, and 'dual use' technologies to regimes which abuse human rights, and strictly control arms sales to regions of tension or potential conflict. - Seek a new international regime to control the arms trade. We will support tighter EU-wide restrictions on transfers of military technology to non-democratic regimes and press for the establishment of a mandatory UN register, in which all arms sales and transfers must be listed. - Ban landmines. We will place an immediate and total ban on the production, stockpiling and export of anti-personnel landmines and work towards a global ban on Iandmine production. Free and fair trade Free and fair trade benefits all. The GATT Uruguay Round has successfully lowered barriers to international trade, but further reforms are needed. We will seek action to: - Enhance free trade by further reducing tariff and non-tariff barriers, especially against the poorest countries. - Improve global labour standards by permitting countries to discriminate against goods produced by nations that maintain practices such as child, slave and forced labour. We will support the work of the International Labour Organisation in raising labour standards throughout the world. - Advance environmental objectives. We support the addition of an environmental sustainability clause to the GATT setting out agreed principles of environmental policy against which trade measures can be judged. - Reduce trans-national corporations' ability to abuse market power, through the development of a framework for global competition policy. The Liberal Democrats and your tax A copy of our Annual Tax Contract will be delivered to each UK household following the Budget each year. Some of the information which would be included is provided on the next page. This Annual Tax Contract will be in keeping with our four Tax Pledges: 1.) No taxation without explanation Central Government should inform taxpayers of the ways in which their money is raised and spent, just as local councils now do. 2.) No promises unless the bill is attached People have the right to know the Government's priorities and how much they will cost. When we make significant changes in our tax and spending priorities we will tell people where the money has come from. We will ask the National Audit Office to make sure that additional expenditure earmarked for specific projects is spent accordingly. 3.) No more tax without tackling waste Each year we will set out the measures which we plan to implement in order to reduce wasteful expenditure and deliver best value for money to taxpayers. We will never raise taxes without first scrutinising Government expenditure for waste. 4.) Fair tax for all Tax bands, rates and reliefs should ensure that everyone contributes according to their ability to pay and that the tax burden is fairly shared. We will aim to take more of those on low incomes out of tax completely. We will clamp down on tax avoidance and evasion. We will provide a mechanism for people to give their views on tax and spending priorities. Costing our commitment - We have issued alongside this manifesto a Costings Supplement to show in detail how our proposals will be financed. - We will raise the basic rate of income tax by one penny in the pound - from 23p to 24p - to help finance our £2bn per year programme of Education investment. - We will increase the amount of income which people can receive before they start to pay income tax by £200 per year to £4,245. This tax cut will be paid for by introducing a new rate of income tax of 50%, payable on taxable income of over £100,000 per year. Half a million people will be freed from income tax altogether - We will put 5p on a packet of cigarettes and use the money to restore free eye and dental checks for all and freeze prescription charges. FOR FULL DETAILS OF THE LIBERAL DEMOCRATS' 1997 MANIFESTO COSTINGS, PLEASE SEE OUR COSTINGS SUPPLEMENT  How the proposals in this manifesto would alter your tax and the Government's spending  Main income tax changes - Around 70% of Adults will pay lower or unchanged income tax under our proposals. - Around half of all income taxpayers would be better off or no worse off under our income tax proposals. - Excluding those earning over £100,000 per year, the average income taxpayer will pay only around 45p extra per week in income tax under our plans. In this manifesto, we have set out a practical, forward-looking programme to modernise Britain. Its central theme is the widening of opportunities. And its aim is to make Britain a nation of self-reliant individuals, living in strong communities, backed by an enabling government. We do not duck the choices that have to be faced in this election. And we do not pretend that they are easy - or free. High-quality education has to be paid for. As do decent public services and a more secure society. You cannot, in the present climate, have these and tax cuts as well. You have to choose. We ask you to do so. Your vote can make a real difference in turning our country away from short-term politics towards a more constructive long-term approach. And with your support we believe we can make a difference too. Every vote we receive is a vote for better education, the modernisation of our politics, a cleaner environment, a better health service and more crime free communities. Every vote we get and every seat we win will ensure that in the next Parliament, Britain, can at last face, up to the challenge, as we enter the next millennium."

Jobs and Business OPPORTUNITY AND OWNERSHIP FOR INDIVIDUALS AND FAMILIES 3. Choice and Security for Families 4. Education and Opportunity WORLD CLASS HEALTH AND PUBLIC SERVICES 5. Security in Health 6. Better Public Services A SAFE AND CIVIL SOCIETY 7. Law, Order and Security A CONFIDENT, UNITED AND SOVEREIGN NATION 8. The Best Place in the World to Live 9. Europe and the World 10. The Constitution    FOREWORD  The Conservative administrations elected since 1979 are among the most successful in British peacetime history. A country once the sick man of Europe, has become its most successful economy. A country once brought to its knees by over mighty powerful trade unions, now has industrial peace. Abroad, the cold war has been won; at home, the rule of law has been restored. The enterprising virtues of the British people have been liberated from the dead hand of the state. There can be no doubt that we have created a better Britain.  Why, then, do we still need a Conservative Government? Because resting on what we have achieved is not enough. To stand still is to fall back. Our goal must be for Britain to be the best place in the world to live.  We live in a tougher, more uncertain world. A fast-moving global free market is emerging. New economic powers are rising in the East. Family life and social attitudes are changing. Europe is adjusting to the end of communism. The European social model is failing. The nation state is under threat. We must respond to these challenges.  We have turned around our economic fortunes. We have fewer people out of work and more in work than any other major European economy. British people now have the opportunity of a prosperous future. But that prosperity cannot be taken for granted. We have to compete to win. That means a constant fight to keep tight control over public spending and enable Britain to remain the lowest taxed major economy in Europe. It means a continuing fight to keep burdens off business, maintaining our opt-out of the European Social Chapter. If we relax for one moment, our hard won success will slip away again.  We have strengthened choice and personal ownership for families, and rolled back the state from areas where it was interfering unnecessarily in our lives. But we now have the opportunity to achieve a massive expansion in wealth and ownership so that more families can enjoy the self-respect and independence that comes with being self-sufficient from the state. Our far-reaching proposals for personal pension funds are central to achieving this - so too are our plans to increase support for the family in our tax system. Our aim is to spread opportunity for all to succeed, whoever they are and wherever they come from, provided they are prepared to work hard. To turn the ""have nots"" into the ""haves"". To support the family in providing security and stability.  We have modernised and reformed many of the areas where the state still has a vital role. But we now have to build on these reforms to deliver even better services. We must continue providing the resources to invest in our modernised health service. We can now provide parents with a hard-edged guarantee of standards in schools. We need also to widen choice in areas where state bureaucracy has constrained it.  We have pioneered new ways of building partnerships that engage the private sector in areas previously dependent on the public purse. We now need to capture private sector investment on a massive scale to regenerate our cities, transform our crumbling local authority housing estates and modernise other public assets.  The only way to secure this future of opportunity is to stick with the Conservative programme of continuing reform. Now would be the worst possible moment to abandon the pathway to prosperity on which we are set. We must keep up the momentum.  At the same time we must maintain the security that a stable nation provides in an uncertain, fast changing world. We must protect our constitution and unity as a nation from those who threaten it with unnecessary and dangerous change. And we must stand up for our interests in shaping a free-market Europe of sovereign nation states.  There is, of course, an alternative on offer: to load costs on business while calling it ""stakeholding""; to increase the role of the state, while calling it ""the community""; to succumb to a centralised Europe while calling it ""not being isolated""; to break up our country while calling it ""devolution"".  To risk this alternative would be a disaster for our country. We have come a very long way. We must be sure that we do not throw away what we have gained, or lose the opportunities we have earned.  You can only be sure with the Conservatives.    A CHOICE OF TWO FUTURES  THE ENTERPRISE CENTRE OF EUROPE  OUR RECORD - ENTERPRISE  The UK is on course to grow faster than both France and Germany for the sixth successive year in 1998 - a post-war record.  Inflation has now been below 4% for well over 4 years, the longest period of low inflation for over half a century.  Mortgage rates are at their lowest levels for 30 years.  Unemployment has fallen to its lowest level for 6 years. We now have a lower unemployment rate than any other major European economy. Youth unemployment in Britain has fallen to less than 15% whereas by contrast, in France it has risen to 27% and in Italy to 33%.  A higher proportion of our people are in work than in any other major European economy - 68% against a Continental average of 57%.  The UK is the favourite location for inward investment into Europe, attracting around one third of inward investment into the European Union.  We have the lowest tax burden of any major European economy, with the government taking almost 8% less of national income than the European average.  Public borrowing has averaged 3.4% of GDP since 1979 compared with 6.8% (and a peak of 9.5%) under the last Labour Government. Our level of public debt is now one of the lowest in the European Union - whereas it was one of the highest in 1979.  In 1994 the UK lost 300,000 working days through strikes, the lowest figure ever recorded; in 1979 the figure was 29,500,000: nearly 100 times that figure.  Britain ranks fifth in the world in international trade, and exports more per head than America or Japan. Exports account for 28% of GDP as against 9% for Japan, 11% for USA and 24% for Germany and France. Britain's current account is broadly in balance, reflecting our increased competitiveness and improved trading.  1. DOUBLING LIVING STANDARDS  The free market is winning the battle of ideas the world over. From Russia to Vietnam, from China to Romania, people are realising that the socialist model has failed. This is not just an economic triumph. It is a triumph for human freedom. Britain helped to secure it. We should take pride in it.  The spread of the free market heralds a new age of global competition. That means new markets for British goods and services, but new competitors for British companies as well.  If we try to protect ourselves from these challenges with more regulations, public subsidies and a cosy dependence on government then Britain will fail. But if we boldly embrace these new opportunities by pushing forward the economic revolution we began in 1979, then we will enter the next millennium with boundless prospects for growth and prosperity.  That choice - between stagnation and dynamism - is the choice which faces Britain at this election. It is a stark choice between the British way - of trusting the people and unleashing enterprise - and the failing social model, practised on the continent, which the Labour Party wants to impose on us here under the guise of ""stakeholding"".  Hard economic evidence shows how great is the divide between these two strategies. Britain is now in its fifth year of growing faster than France or Germany. Unemployment in Britain has fallen to less than two million, while it rises across Europe. Britain attracts nearly forty per cent of all the American and Japanese investment in Europe. Our aim now is to safeguard these achievements and build on them, so Britain becomes the unrivalled Enterprise Centre of Europe.  A LOW TAX ECONOMY  For enterprise to flourish, the state must get out of the way of the wealth creators. We are the only party that can cut taxes because we are the only party which is serious about controlling public spending. The choice between the two economic philosophies is clear. In the years before 1979, public spending in Britain kept pace with the average for Europe as a whole. Since then, it has continued rising on the Continent, while we have restrained public spending here. Now, public spending takes about 40% of our national income as against an average of 50% on the continent. We have broken free from a trend in which the rest of Europe is still trapped.  Conservative government will keep public spending under tight control and ensure that it grows by less than the economy as a whole over the economic cycle. At the same time we will continue to spend more on the services which matter most to people - hospitals, schools and the police.  Over the next parliament, we will achieve our goal for the government to spend less than 40% of our national income.  That means we can reduce the amount government borrows too, and meet our aim of moving towards a balanced budget in the medium term. Our plans show how we can virtually eliminate public borrowing by the year 2000.  Thanks to our success in controlling public spending, Britain is now Europe's low tax economy. This is one of the reasons why we are becoming the Enterprise Centre of Europe.  Our aim is to ensure Britain keeps the lowest tax burden of any major European economy.  In the election manifesto of 1992, we promised that ""We will make further progress towards a basic income tax rate of 20p"". Since then, we have cut the basic rate of income tax from 25p to 23p, and extended the 20p band so that over a quarter of all taxpayers now only pay income tax at the 20p rate. Achieving our public expenditure goals will mean we can sustain permanently low tax levels.  Over the next parliament, our aim will be to achieve our target of a 20p basic rate of income tax, while maintaining a maximum tax rate of no more than 40p.  STABLE PRICES  Inflation has to be kept firmly under control for an economy to thrive. Britain is now enjoying the longest period of stable prices for almost fifty years. We are on target to reach our goal of 21/2% inflation this year.  Low inflation has delivered lower interest rates whilst preserving the value of people's savings. Homeowners are now enjoying mortgage rates at the lowest levels for 30 years.  It has taken tough decisions to break free from our reputation as a high inflation economy. No Conservative government will jeopardise this achievement.  During the next parliament, we will maintain an inflation target of 21/2% or less.  RISING LIVING STANDARDS  The only secure base for rising living standards is a strongly growing economy, low levels of public spending and taxation, and stable prices. That is exactly what Britain is achieving. People are reaping the rewards of their hard work as their take home pay increases. Between 1974 and 1979, the take home pay for a family on average earnings rose, in real terms, by just £1 a week in today's prices. Since 1979 it has increased by £100 a week and; this year alone it will increase by £7 a week.  The goal which we set ourselves in 1995 is to double living standards over 25 years.  We are on course to achieve our goal.  2. JOBS AND BUSINESS  Our priority is to create jobs. This is not just an economic priority, but also a social and moral one. Jobs and enterprise are the best ways of tackling poverty and deprivation.  Britain is succeeding. 900,000 jobs have been created over the past 4 years. By contrast the European social model is stifling job creation on the continent by imposing regulations and burdens on business. In the United Kingdom unemployment is much lower than in the rest of Europe and falling whereas in Germany, France, and Italy it has risen to its highest level for a generation. This is no accident. It is because we have pursued very different policies from those on the Continent.  Curbing the power of trade unions, opening up markets and cutting red tape, have given us a low strike, low cost economy: and as a result we are the number one location for foreign investment in Europe.  Never have such policies been so important. For the first time this century we face a world full of capitalist competition. The only way Britain will be able to compete and win in world markets is by sticking to the Conservative policies that are delivering success. We can earn prosperity as one of the world's most successful global trading nations. We should not risk this progress by adopting the very policies that have made the continent uncompetitive and have increased unemployment in Europe by 4.5 million over the past 5 years.  SMALL BUSINESSES - BRITAIN'S RISK-TAKERS  Governments do not create jobs. Businesses do. The source of tomorrow's jobs will be small businesses, the seedcorn of Britain's prosperity. Over the last 15 years, small businesses have created over 2 million jobs. By the year 2000, over half the workforce should be working in companies which employ fewer than 50 people. Back in 1979 only a third of the workforce did.  Entrepreneurs often risk everything when they set up their own business. We have already helped them: raising the VAT threshold, cutting employer's national insurance contributions, simplifying audit requirements and much more besides. Now we intend to go further, tackling the remaining problems they face.  High taxes and rates deter enterprise. Our low tax structure has been crucial to our industrial revival. We already have the lowest corporation tax of any major industrialised country. As we want small businesses to flourish, we will go even further.  We will cut the small companies rate of corporation tax in line with personal taxation as we move towards a 20p basic rate.  Investment and enterprise are deterred if the tax man takes too much of the capital that is built up by a successful business. Capital is ever more mobile, flying around the world to places where the tax on it is low: Britain must be one of those places.  We will continue to reduce the burden of capital gains tax and inheritance tax as it is prudent to do so.  One of the heaviest burdens small businesses face is business rates. At the moment, this bears more heavily upon small businesses than large ones.  In the next parliament, we will reform business rates to reduce the cost that falls upon small businesses.  No businessman has time to fill out reams of forms. We will continue to simplify the administration of NICs and PAYE for small firms, allowing them to concentrate on satisfying customers not bureaucrats. We are also tackling a problem that hits small businesses particularly hard - the late payment of bills. On top of our programme to ensure government departments and local authorities pay on time we have legislated to require companies to publish their payment policy and to report their record on how quickly they pay their bills to small businesses.  We have already abolished over a thousand regulations. New regulations must only be introduced if it is clear that their benefits exceed their costs and they do not place an undue burden on a small firm.  We will introduce ""sunset"" requirements into new regulations whenever it is suitable so that they are automatically reviewed or dropped after a specific period.  Many businessmen suffer regulatory burdens imposed by local government and quangos.  We will therefore insist that the whole of the public sector adopts the same stringent rules that we require of central government in justifying the benefits of new regulations against their costs.  REDUCING THE BURDEN ON COMPANIES  Jobs depend on British firms winning orders: the difference between success or failure can be wafer thin. Any extra burden on business will destroy jobs.  Britain is enjoying more jobs and record investment, thanks to the competitive edge we have over other European countries. We are a low cost economy. But that does not mean we are a low pay economy. Our competitive advantage comes from the lower costs facing our businesses. It can be measured by the social costs an employer has to pay on top of every £100 of wages: in Germany it is £31, in France £41, but in Britain, it is only £15.  Many countries in Europe have tried to cocoon themselves from global competition behind layers of red tape and regulation - such as the Social Chapter and a national minimum wage. This provides a false sense of security, playing a cruel trick on working people. It also excludes the unemployed from work. As companies in the rest of Europe have grown more uncompetitive, employers have found it too expensive to employ new workers, investment has gone elsewhere, and the dole queues have lengthened. The European social model is not social and not a model for us to follow. But if Britain signed up to the Social Chapter it would be used to impose that model on us - destroying British jobs.  No Conservative government will sign up to the Social Chapter or introduce a national minimum wage. We will insist at the Intergovernmental Conference in Amsterdam that our opt out is honoured and that Britain is exempted from the Working Time Directive: if old agreements are broken, we do not see how new ones can be made.  We will resist the imposition of other social burdens on the work place through a new European employment chapter.  WELFARE INTO WORK  Although governments cannot create jobs, they can help people train and find work. We now have in place a battery of schemes working with Training and Enterprise Councils to provide targeted help and training, including remedial education in literacy and numeracy. We are also developing new incentives, alongside Family Credit, to help people move off benefit into work.  We will always help those in genuine need: in return, the unemployed have a responsibility to look for work and accept a reasonable offer. That belief underpins our new Jobseekers Allowance which ensures that no-one can refuse reasonable work opportunities and remain on benefit.  As unemployment falls, we want to focus on those who have been unemployed for some time. At present, Project Work is helping 100,000 people who have been unemployed for more than 2 years in cities around Britain. They are first given help in finding a job - which includes giving employers incentives to take them on. Those who do not find jobs are then required to work for a specific period on a community project. This helps them regain work habits and ensures they are available for work.  As Project Work succeeds and demonstrates that its costs can be met by the savings from getting people into work, we will extend the programme to cover the long term unemployed nation-wide.  We will also develop an innovative ""Britain Works"" scheme which uses the experience and ingenuity of private and voluntary sectors to get people off welfare into work.  Britain has one of the most mobile economies in Europe. People move on and up, into better paid jobs more easily than on the Continent.  THE INFORMATION SOCIETY  Britain is at the forefront of creating tomorrow's information society. Already we have exposed domestic telecommunications to competition and stimulated investment in cable and satellite entertainment systems. And by opening up international telecommunications we will continue to encourage companies worldwide to base their global operations here. We will make sure that the digital revolution comes to Britain first.  We are launching an ambitious programme with industry to spread ""IT for All"", giving every adult the opportunity to try out and learn about new IT services. We will work with industry to ensure that all schools are connected to the information superhighway.  We will use the Millennium Lottery Fund to transform the computer facilities and information links available in schools, libraries, museums, voluntary organisations and other public places after the turn of the century.  This will give the public much wider access to information services in the years ahead. We will also take advantage of information technology to transform the way government provides services to the public.  We will keep Britain in the vanguard of new mobile service development - including mobile telephone and information services - by introducing a pricing system for the radio spectrum to achieve more efficient allocation of radio frequencies.  We will maintain a strong, free and competitive broadcasting and press environment at both national and local level, while continuing to be vigilant in monitoring whether action is needed to curb breaches of standards, and prevent unacceptable press intrusion.  SCIENCE  British science enjoys a worldwide reputation for excellence and cost-effectiveness, which makes Britain an attractive base for many domestic and overseas companies. We will continue to invest in science and target funds at basic research, which would not otherwise be funded by industry. At the same time we will provide an enterprising environment which encourages firms to invest with confidence in applied science.  2020 VISION  There is no part of the globe which has not been reached by British enterprise and British culture. We have always looked out beyond these shores, beyond this Continent. Our language, our heritage of international trading links, our foreign investments - second only to America's - are historic strengths which mean we are ideally placed to seize the opportunities of the global economy.  Thanks to Conservative policies of liberalisation and privatisation we are strong in industries of the future such as telecommunications, financial services, and information technology. These are the industries that will benefit from opening up trade around the world. We will push for completion of the European Single Market and continue to pursue the objective of transatlantic free trade against the background of world trade liberalisation.  Our aim is nothing less than tariff free trade across the globe by the year 2020.  Free competition is important for free markets. Companies should not make agreements that restrict competition and hence result in poor value for consumers. We have set out proposals to give companies greater protection against price fixing, dumping, and other restrictive practices by larger competitors.  We will introduce a Competition Bill to take forward these proposals in the first session of the next parliament.  We are committed to pushing forward our competitiveness agenda which is making Britain the Enterprise Centre of Europe.  OPPORTUNITY AND OWNERSHIP FOR INDIVIDUALS AND FAMILIES  OUR RECORD - OPPORTUNITY  The right to buy has allowed 1.5 million council tenants to become homeowners. There are over 4 million more homeowners today than in 1979.  The Government has spent £6 billion through housing associations to provide homes for rent. Between 1992 and 1995 housing associations provided 178,000 new lettings - 25,000 more than promised in the 1992 Manifesto.  There are now around 10 million private shareholders, up from about 3 million at the time of the last Labour government. 2.5 million people now have tax free savings in PEP accounts, and 4.5 million in TESSAs.  Since 1979, the success of private pension provision has raised the average income of pensioners by 60% more than inflation. Almost 90% of recently retired pensioners now have incomes over and above state benefits.  Savings in private pension funds have increased to £650 billion - more than 4 times the level in 1979. Their value is greater than the pension funds in all other EU countries added together.  Over the period 1979 to 1995, education spending per pupil rose from £515 to £1,890 - an increase in real terms of 48%. Real spending on books and equipment per pupil rose 56%. Teachers' real pay rose 57%: from £270 per week in 1979 to £420 in 1995.  In 1979, 40% of three and four year olds attended nursery school; in 1995 the figure was 59%. Our nursery vouchers now give this opportunity to every child.  The proportion of sixteen year olds staying on in full-time education rose from 4 out of 10 in 1979 to 7 out of 10 in 1995.  Almost 1 in 3 young people now go to university, compared with 1 in 8 in 1979.  The proportion of adults with no academic qualifications has halved since 1979 and the proportion of adults with a degree or equivalent has more than doubled rising from 5% to 12%.  3. CHOICE AND SECURITY FOR FAMILIES  The family is the most important institution in our lives. It offers security and stability in a fast-changing world. But the family is undermined if governments take decisions which families ought to take for themselves. Self-reliance underpins freedom and choice.  Families are stronger if they have the money to look after themselves: that is why we are shifting power and wealth back to working families and away from the state. We have already achieved much - the average family's disposable income has gone up by 40% since 1979. But we want to go further. The next Conservative government intends to reform the tax system so that it gives substantially more help to families.  We also want to encourage people to save so they have the security and self-respect that comes from being able to rely on their own resources rather than immediately turning to the state. We have already made much progress here too with widening ownership of homes, pensions, and the new PEPs and TESSAs. We now propose further radical measures for more saving for retirement.  FAMILIES AND TAX  We believe families should be left with as much of their own money as possible. They know better than politicians how to spend it. We have already cut the basic rate of income tax from 33p to 23p, and our aim is to get it down to 20p, benefiting 18 million taxpayers. We intend to do even more to help families in particular.  At the moment, if one spouse does not take paid work in order to look after children or dependent relatives, they not only give up earnings but may also be unable to benefit from their personal tax allowance. Yet this is the time at which their income is often most stretched.  We believe our tax system should recognise and support the crucial role of families in their caring responsibilities. We will give them that support.  We will give priority to future reductions in personal taxation that help families looking after dependent children or relatives by allowing one partner's unused personal allowance to be transferred to a working spouse where they have these responsibilities.   This will provide a targeted reduction in the tax bill to those families who need it most. Around 2 million one taxpayer couples with dependent children, or looking after elderly relatives and others needing care, would gain up to £17.50 a week - around £900 a year.  FAMILY SAVINGS  In the old days people just depended on the weekly pay packet or money from the state. But no job can be secure and the state cannot provide for every eventuality. It is ownership which brings true security and genuine independence from the state. That is why Conservatives have long dreamed of a property-owning democracy. Now we are delivering it in practice. Home ownership is up by 4.7 million. 10 million people own a direct personal stake in our economy. 16 million are gaining shares in their building societies thanks to our deregulation of them. We intend to carry forward our vision of a people's share. This is a significant increase in personal security. It is the Conservative vision of security through personal savings - not a socialist vision of security through the state.  We want people to enjoy Britain's success - especially by owning shares in the companies for which they work. We have already introduced a number of schemes to encourage employee share ownership. To encourage a further expansion of worker shares, our new Share Match Scheme will allow employees to be rewarded with additional free shares if they acquire a stake in their company.  Our goal is that by 2000, more than half of the employees of Britain's larger companies will own shares in those companies.  41/2 million people now benefit from tax free TESSAs and 2.5 million from PEP schemes to encourage the accumulation of long term saving. We will continue to build on this success by exploring ways in which existing tax exemptions for savings can be developed - allowing individuals to secure their futures and protect their families against unexpected contingencies.  We will continue to raise the threshold for inheritance tax as it prudent to do so.  People are not just saving for themselves but for their children and grand-children. These savings should not be penalised by the tax system.  For many people their biggest asset is their pension. Thanks to the steps we have already taken to encourage occupational and personal pensions, we now have £650 billion invested in private pensions - more than the rest of the European Union put together. We now plan to build further on this achievement.  We will make it easier for small employers to set up personal pension plans for groups of employees.  We will create more flexibility for people who save in personal pension plans to continue investing in those schemes if they subsequently move to jobs with company pension schemes.   We will also create flexibility for employees with savings in Additional Voluntary Contributions (AVC) schemes to take part of that pension earlier or later than their main company pension.   But we believe the time has now come to plan for another important step in improving Britain's pension provision. Britain is already much better placed than many other countries to afford state pensions in the future, but we want even more people to be able to look forward to a properly funded pension that grows with the economy and is free from dependence on taxes paid by future generations. We now propose a practical way of achieving a gradual transformation of the state pension scheme.  At the start of the next parliament we will set out proposals to provide all young people entering the workforce with a personal pension fund paid for through a rebate on their national insurance contributions. At retirement they would be entitled to the full pension earned by this accumulated investment. This could give them a pension significantly higher than they would currently receive from the state. But they with be guaranteed a pension at least equal to the current basic state pension, increased in line with inflation.  This will be one of the most significant improvements in the state pension system since it was introduced.  Older people currently in the workforce would be unaffected - they will continue to contribute as now and receive the normal state pension when they retire.  This policy would come into effect early in the new millennium. Gradual phasing in of the new system over 40 years will make the impact on public finances affordable. Even at its peak, the net revenue forgone will be only a fraction of the savings from the recent Pensions Act. And eventually, the new policy will produce massive public expenditure savings.  This far-sighted idea is in the best Conservative tradition. The growing wealth of the nation will provide for the next generation through private funding, underpinned by a state guarantee. British people will be able to look forward to retirement with even greater confidence. And our young people will have a pensions opportunity unrivalled in the world.  SUPPORT FOR FAMILIES  Conservatives believe that a healthy society encourages people to accept responsibility for their own lives. A heavy-handed and intrusive state can do enormous damage.  Some families need help to cope with their responsibilities. For them, Social Services play a vital role. They help with children where parental care has failed. They deliver an ever wider range of services to people with learning difficulties or who are mentally ill. Our community care reforms have given them a central role ensuring that elderly people get care of the highest quality: and in their own homes where possible. We need to ensure that role is properly fulfilled.  Early in the next Parliament we will introduce a Social Services Reform Bill which will create a new statutory framework for social services. The Bill will provide for greater openness and accountability in social services.  We will provide new guidance to ensure social workers properly reflect the values of the community - focusing their efforts on those families who most need support, and minimising unnecessary interference. Social workers working with children will receive special training to cope with the often heart-rending cases they face.   We will raise standards through a new regulatory framework which will apply the same standards in both the public and private sector.   We will also remove the power of local authorities to operate care homes where this is in the best interests of the people for whom they are responsible.   We believe that families who use social services should be able to exercise choice wherever practicable. We have given cash payments to disabled people to purchase the services they need directly.  We also want new ways of reinforcing individual choice where possible. We will therefore ensure no barriers stand in the way of local authorities wanting to issue their users with vouchers to buy certain services.  We will review the direct payment scheme, and provided it has been cost effective, we will extend it to other users of social services.  Above all, we want to help families to help themselves. Caring for older - or disabled - relatives is one of the most natural human instincts. We recognise the crucial - and often demanding - role carers play, and will help them more.  We will introduce a Respite Care Programme. This will enable family members with heavy responsibilities caring for a relative to take a much needed break. We will also offer more practical advice for carers who want to go back to paid work.  But in some cases, elderly people need more care than their friends or relatives can provide. Financing long term care worries many families. We will create an imaginative, fair partnership between individuals and the public sector to resolve this problem.  In the first session of the next Parliament we will implement our partnership scheme for long term care, making it easier for people to afford the cost of care in old age without giving up their lifetime savings.  Good preparation for marriage can be an important aid to a successful family, while timely help in meeting difficulties can often avoid family breakdown. These are matters for voluntary effort, not the state, but we will continue to support such effort.  We need to make sure efforts to help struggling families does not turn into unnecessary meddling.  When the state goes too far, it is often the children who suffer. They become victims of the worst sort of political correctness.  We will introduce legislation to remove unnecessary barriers to adoption and introduce new rules to make adoption from abroad more straightforward.   We will also monitor the workings of the Children Act, and act if necessary to ensure it maintains a proper balance between the rights of children and the responsibilities of adults.  Social Services departments are now the fourth arm of the welfare state. Most people will need them at some point in their lives. We will ensure that the Conservative revolution in public services now reaches Social Services.  DISABLED PEOPLE  We have quadrupled real spending on long term sick and disabled people since 1979, to £22 billion.  We have introduced the Disability Discrimination Act. This is the first legislation of its kind anywhere in Europe and it provides positive proof of our commitment to disabled people. We will monitor it to ensure it continues to meet its objectives.  We are also providing a continuing fund to support the most severely disabled people to stay in their homes.  SECURITY IN RETIREMENT  Pensioners continue to make a positive contribution to society in retirement. They give more of their time in charitable work than any other age group. They lift some of the pressures on their own families. They help keep our nation's history and traditions alive.  They have paid their National Insurance contributions and taxes and rightly expect us to continue to protect the value of the basic state pension against price rises. We will do so. We will also ensure that less well off pensioners continue to get extra help on top of the basic pension.  At the same time as protecting the state pension, our encouragement of private pensions is already transforming the living standards of pensioners. The average net income of pensioners has risen by 60% since 1979. This has been achieved by our encouragement of saving for retirement.  The tax system must help pensioners who have saved. Our new lower 20p rate on income from savings directly helps 1.7 million pensioners and the special age allowances raise the point at which pensioners start to pay income tax.  A BETTER SOCIAL SECURITY SYSTEM  People in need can rely on our continuing support. And to ensure that taxpayers are willing to go on paying for that support, we have shaped a social security system we can afford, taking a steadily declining share of our national income. We are doing this by focusing benefits on those most in need, helping people off welfare and into work, and curbing welfare fraud. These policies are underpinned by our measures to help families help themselves.  Social Security must be there to help families, pensioners and people in need. We will protect the value of Child Benefit and Family Credit which help with the cost of bringing up children. This is our Family Benefits Guarantee.  We will bring the structure of benefits for lone parents into line with that for two-parent families. We will continue to help lone parents obtain maintenance, and assist with childcare in work: both these measures help lone parents obtain work. We will pilot our ""Parent Plus"" Scheme that gives special help to lone parents who want to work, and extend it as it proves successful.  Social Security fraud must be stamped out.  We will intensify our current initiatives of inspections and checks including more home visits, to crack down further on benefit cheats. We will introduce benefit cards across the country. We will establish a Benefit Fraud Inspectorate to monitor local authorities' performance. We will also improve the sharing of information between government departments to catch more fraudulent claims.  To ensure as much of the Social Security budget as possible goes into benefits, we will continue to improve the efficiency of administration, using the best mix of public and private sector operations.  HOUSING  Owning one's own home is an aim shared by millions of people. Over the last 18 years, the number of homeowners has increased by 4.7 million - including 1.7 million who have brought their home under the right to buy scheme. Over the next 10 years, we expect to see about one and a half million people buying their own homes - some 3,000 every week. To meet that demand, we will continue to allow local authority and housing association tenants to buy their homes or move to houses which they buy.  We will also carry through our draft Bill, creating the option for those buying flats to choose a new form of commonhold ownership.  For those who wish to rent their home, we are encouraging a thriving private rental market, building on the success of housing investment trusts and protecting assured tenancies.  Easier renting will help us meet our target of reducing the proportion of empty homes below 3%. The number of empty houses has fallen in each of the last 3 years. But nothing is more frustrating for people who need social housing than the sight of a suitable property owned by the public sector lying boarded up and empty. We will stop that.  Public landlords will have to sell houses which are available for occupation yet have been left empty without a good reason for more than 12 months.   Housing associations and housing companies will continue to receive help in building new homes, and we will encourage more public - private partnerships. Together, these policies will help meet the demand for new public housing and make sure that there are decent homes for those in need.  OPPORTUNITIES FOR WOMEN  Women are succeeding in Britain. More women have jobs in Britain than in almost any other European country. Women have a better education, more financial independence and more opportunities than at any other time in Britain's history.  This success reflects the efforts and determination of many women. Government's role has been simpler - to level up the playing field, whether in education, where girls are now doing better than boys, or in the workplace, where opportunities for women are the best in Europe.  But we know our job is not yet done. Some women still face barriers to doing well. Some still do not have the financial security they deserve. And crime, and the fear of crime, often affect women more than men.  We will ensure women have equal opportunities in education and the workplace. This can best be achieved by keeping our economy buoyant and our labour markets flexible. And our proposals to bring crime rates down further will help women especially.  But many women - and some men - face a particular problem: how to juggle job and family. For those who need or want to work, we will seek further ways to minimise the barriers to affordable, high quality childcare. For those who wish to be full-time parents, our proposals to enable them to transfer their unused personal allowance to their spouse will be worth up to an extra £17.50 a week.  We also want to give women more financial independence, particularly when they retire. We propose, as explained elsewhere, to improve flexibility in saving for retirement and to allow courts to split pensions on divorce.  LOOKING OUTWARDS  The spread of share ownership, the transformation of pension provision, and the sale of council houses are revolutionising our nation. Personal prosperity and property ownership are not selfish or inward-looking.  People who are secure at home can look out for others in their community. Over two thirds of adults engage in some form of voluntary activity. By the end of 1997 all young people aged between 15 and 25 who want to volunteer will be helped to find an opportunity to do so.  We will encourage voluntary work by others living on benefit while continuing to insist that those who are capable of work should actively seek employment. We will also develop accreditation for voluntary work to encourage employers to see it as preparation for a paid job.  We will make it easier for those receiving incapacity benefit to volunteer by removing the 16 hour weekly limit on their voluntary work.  It is wrong to imagine that compassion must be nationalised and that we can only help our fellow man through state action.  4. EDUCATION AND OPPORTUNITY  All children dream of what they might do when they grow up. Our task is to help them turn those dreams into reality whatever their background may be. It is an exciting world, full of new opportunities for inquiring minds: it should be open to every child. Their future - and Britain's prosperity - depends on the quality of their education.  OUR EDUCATION GUARANTEE  A good education is the birthright of every child. Literacy is the building block of all future learning: English is the global language of commerce and, much more, a thing of beauty. Without basic science and mathematics, the modern world is incomprehensible. Every child therefore must be taught to read, write and add up from an early age.  Years of mistaken, progressive education in the 1960s and 1970s denied these precious skills to too many children. We have worked ceaselessly since 1979 to put that right. Our decision to test children and publish the results has allowed standards to be measured and exposed. We have reformed the curriculum, toughened inspections, and given more information and power to parents. Our many excellent teachers now know what is expected of them, and already standards in schools are rising. But they are still not good enough. We must do more.  Building on what we have done, we can now offer a new pledge to parents - a guarantee of education standards.  First, we will set national targets for school performance that reflect our objective of ensuring that Britain is in the top league of international standards across the whole spectrum of education.   Second, we will require every school to plan how to improve its performance, and to set targets which relate to similar schools and national standards.   Third, we will give all parents full information on the performance of their child's school.   Fourth, to underwrite our pledge, we will ensure action is taken to bring any under-performing school up to the mark.   We will meet this pledge by using the full set of levers for improved standards that we have put in place.  We are revising and simplifying the National Curriculum in primary schools to emphasise high standards in the basic skills.  Parents and teachers must have an overview of not just how much a child has learnt while at school, but how the school performs against others. Poor schooling must not be protected by a veil of secrecy. Parent power is a vital force for higher standards.  Regular tests and exams are essential if teachers are to discover how much their pupils have learnt, and parents are to know how much progress their children are making against national standards. That is why children are already being tested at 7, 11 and 14.  We will publish all school test results, including the results of tests of 7 and 14 year olds.   We propose also to assess every child at five.   This will give teachers and parents a benchmark against which they can measure future progress. To give a better measure of pupils performance, marks out of 100 will be made available to parents as well as the broad-brush levels.  We will also introduce a new test for 14 year old children that covers the whole National Curriculum - assessing progress before they choose subjects for GCSE.   Tests and exams need to be rigorous and demanding. We will insist that they establish children's command of spelling, punctuation, and grammar in English tests. Children will sit arithmetic tests without calculators. We will not allow such extensive use of open books in tests and in GCSE exams. We will establish an English Language GCSE. We will continue to uphold the gold standard of A-levels, and ensure that the great classics of our literature are studied at A-level. At the same time students should have the chance to study more subjects in the sixth form.  Rigorous tests show how individual children and schools are performing and expose schools that are not giving children the education they deserve. To underwrite our guarantee, we will then take action to improve standards. We cannot tolerate schools that fail their pupils.  By this summer every secondary school in the country will have been inspected by independent inspectors, and by summer 1998, every primary school will have been inspected as well. We have the power to take over failing schools directly and close them if necessary. We will now go further and require every school to set and publish regular targets and plans for improving their academic results. Independent inspectors will monitor the results of weaker schools and their plans for improvement at regular intervals.  Sometimes, though, schools are failing because the local education authority which runs them is failing. The authorities with the worst GCSE results and the worst results at Key Stage 2 (11 year olds) are run by Labour. Those children need our help.  We will allow for an independent inspection of education authorities and intervene directly to raise standards where education authorities are letting children down.   Failing authorities will be required to set out their plans to raise standards, and work with education teams - directed by independent inspectors - to implement those plans.  The vast majority of teachers do an outstanding job. They have played a key part in implementing the reforms that we have introduced. A few though, fail their pupils.  We will establish a more rigorous and effective system of appraising teachers, which reflects how well their pupils perform in tests and exams: this will identify which teachers need more help and, where necessary, which teachers need to be replaced.   Many feel that the professional standing of teachers would be strengthened by the creation of a single body which could speak with authority on professional standards. We will consult with teachers and other interested parties about the possible role of such a body.  The school should be a place of stability and stimulation for children, especially if they come from a hostile or turbulent environment. To improve standards in future our new teacher training curriculum will stress traditional teaching methods - including whole class teaching and learning to read by the sounds of letters. We will also encourage more teachers to enter the profession through practical training schemes focused on classroom experience such as the Graduate Teacher Scheme. A child is likely to learn more in a well-ordered school. Teachers must have the powers they need to maintain discipline. We will give teachers greater power to set detentions to exclude disruptive pupils and to use reasonable physical restraint where necessary.  Schools also have an important role to play in spiritual and moral education. We will take steps to ensure that every school fulfils its role of providing religious education and collective worship.  CHOICE AND DIVERSITY  When we came to power in 1979 the schools system was totally dominated by one type of school - the monolithic comprehensive. The system failed our children. It treated every child the same. It told parents where to send their children. It did not give schools the freedom to run their own affairs.  Since 1979 we have created a rich diversity of schools, to serve the varied talents of all children and give parents choice within that diversity, because we believe that parents know what is best for their children.  That is why we - and only we - are committed to giving the parent of every four year old child a voucher for nursery education so they can choose the pre-school education they want for their child, whether in a play-group, a reception class, or a nursery school in the private or state sector.  We will give more talented children, from less well-off backgrounds, the opportunity to go to fee-paying schools by expanding the Assisted Places Scheme to cover all ages of compulsory education, in line with our current spending plans. We propose to develop it further into a wider scholarship scheme covering additional educational opportunities. The freedoms and status of fee-paying schools will be protected.  Grant-maintained schools have been popular with parents across the country - whatever their politics. We will encourage more schools to become grant- maintained and will allow new grant-maintained schools to be set up where there is sufficient local demand. We will give all grant-maintained schools greater freedoms to expand and to select their pupils.  Grant-maintained schools are leading the way. Local authority schools are also benefiting from our policy of local management of schools. Our ultimate objective is that all schools should take full responsibility for the management of their own affairs. In the next parliament we will take another step towards giving them that freedom.  We will extend the benefits of greater self-governance to all LEA schools. We will require local authorities to delegate more of schools' budgets to the schools themselves. We will give them more freedom over the employment of their staff and over admissions. And, where they want it, we will allow them to take over ownership of their assets, so they can make best use of the resources.   Local authorities will continue to be responsible for their schools' standards. They will provide funds, and compete with other organisations to provide services to schools. We would expect the increased responsibility of head-teachers, and their role in achieving efficiency-savings, to be recognised by their pay review body.  Schools are stronger and more effective where head-teachers and governors can shape their own distinctive character. Sometimes that means developing a speciality in some subjects. Sometimes it means selecting children by their aptitudes: where parents want this we should not stand in their way. Special abilities should be recognised and encouraged.  We will continue to encourage the establishment of more specialist schools in technology, arts, languages and sport. We aim to help one in five schools become specialist schools by 2001.   We will allow all schools to select some of their pupils.   We will help schools to become grammar schools in every major town where parents want that choice.   The high standards, real choice and genuine diversity which we have introduced will produce the best results for all our children.  LIFETIME LEARNING  Lifetime learning is a reality in Britain today. Over a half of all students in universities, and seventy per cent of those in further education colleges, are adults who have returned to education later in life. We will continue to create new opportunities for more people to participate.  There has been a revolution in further and higher education. Three and a half million people are in further education - up from just half a million in 1979. The number of young people going to university has risen from one in eight to one in three over the same period.  We will ensure consistently high standards and will consult on the development of higher education when we receive the results of the Dearing Review. We have world class research in British universities which we will continue to support.  Every young person should have the opportunity to continue in education or training.  We will give students between 14 and 21 a learning credit which will enable them to choose suitable education or training leading to recognised qualifications up to A levels or their equivalents.   We will also introduce National Traineeships and encourage employers to offer more work-based Modern Apprenticeships to young people. Objective external assessments of a proper syllabus will be made a part of all National Vocational Qualifications.  We will continue to support the network of Training and Enterprise Councils, which have created a valuable partnership between business and government. We will encourage more employers to become involved in ""Investors in People"", with the public sector matching the performance of the private sector.  Competitive markets demand high skills. If Britain is to win, we need to encourage learning and give people the opportunity to go where their interests and inquiring minds take them.  WORLD CLASS HEALTH AND PUBLIC SERVICES  OUR RECORD - HEALTH AND PUBLIC SERVICES  Government spending has concentrated on priorities, not wasteful bureaucracy and overmanning. Despite tough overall spending plans, real spending on the NHS has risen nearly 75% since 1979, on schools by 50% and on the police by more than 100%.  The Health Service is treating over l million more patients each year than before our reforms.  The number of people waiting over 12 months for hospital treatment has fallen from over 200,000 in 1990 to 22,000 last year. The average wait has fallen from nearly 9 months to 4 months.  The Government has set up the Citizen's Charter to provide first class public services for all citizens. Nearly 650 organisations have received a Charter Mark for meeting demanding standards of performance, customer satisfaction and value for money.  There are now 55,000 more nurses and midwives and 22,500 more doctors and dentists than in 1979. For every senior NHS manager, 77 people are providing direct patient care.  Nurses average earnings have grown 70% in real terms: from £68 a week in 1979 to £325 in 1995. Doctor's pay has risen by a third. Under Labour both were cut.  Infant mortality has fallen from 13.2 to 6.2 per thousand over the last 18 years.  Deaths through road accidents are now the lowest since records began in 1926. Since 1979 road deaths have fallen by 43% and serious casualties have fallen by 43% despite an 85% increase in motor traffic.  The government has invested record amounts on transport - more than £26 billion since 1979 in investment on motorways and trunk roads; £16 billion on railways; and over £8 billion on London Transport.  Privatisation is delivering better services at lower costs. BT's main prices are down by more than 40% in real terms. Average household bills for gas and electricity have also fallen in real terms since 1990.  5. SECURITY IN HEALTH  We have been the guardians of the NHS for most of its life, improving its services and securing its funding. The benefits can be seen in our rising standards of health. 1993 was for example the first year in which no child in this country died of measles. Between 1979 and 1995 life expectancy at birth in England has increased from 70.4 years to 74.3 years for men and from 76.4 years to 79.6 years for women. We are getting healthier and we are better looked after when we are sick.  GROWING RESOURCES FOR A MODERN HEALTH SERVICE  This progress has been possible because we have increased spending since 1979 by 70% more than inflation, to nearly £43 billion. And we are not stopping there. The next Conservative Government will honour a unique guarantee to the NHS.  We will continue, year by year, to increase the real resources committed to the NHS, so NHS spending will continue to share in a growing economy.  Under Labour there have been years when resources for the NHS actually shrank - something that would be inconceivable with the Conservatives.  Money is only really a means to an end: better patient care. Now we are treating 9.2 million hospital in-patients and day cases as against 6.9 million in 1992 and 5.1 million in 1979.  INVESTING IN SKILLED STAFF  We are committed to expanding the medical staff of the NHS. We shall therefore increase medical school intakes to 5,000 a year by the year 2000 and are ahead of schedule in reaching the target.  Good nursing is the bedrock of the NHS. In particular we will increase the number of nurses with specialist qualifications in paediatric intensive care, emergency care, and cancer care. The number of nurses qualifying each year will increase in each of the next 5 years as we continue to expand Project 2000 training.  HIGHER STANDARDS OF SERVICE  We are tackling the problem of long waiting times which can cause so much worry, distress, and pain. We have set tough targets under the Patients Charter and as a result average waiting times for inpatient hospital treatments have fallen from more than 6 months 5 years ago to 4 months last year.  Patients no longer put up with being kept in ignorance. They want to know more.  We will publish more information on how successfully hospitals are treating patients so that they and their GPs can make more informed choices between services in different hospitals and help stimulate better performance.  BETTER PRIMARY CARE  Our vision of the NHS is one in which hospitals and family doctors gain greater power to run their own affairs. That is why we will continue to encourage the spread of fundholding among GPs. Labour by contrast would destroy the new freedoms that fundholding doctors enjoy by imposing a new layer of bureaucracy on top of them.  However, we do not want the benefits of better healthcare to be confined to patients of GP fundholders. Our proposals to shift more healthcare towards family doctors are open to all.  We shall implement the new Primary Care Act which will enable all family doctors to provide a broader range of patient services within their surgeries. This will include ""super surgeries"" and practice-based cottage hospitals that can offer faster and more local treatment.  We expect to see the number of nurses working in GP practices continue to grow, as will the number of GPs.  We will extend nation-wide our plans to enable more nurses to prescribe a wider range of drugs for patients, recognising their contribution to primary care.  MENTAL HEALTH  The last decade has also seen major changes to the care of mentally ill people. We will continue to develop a full range of services - including 24-hour nursed hostels and secure units - that can care for them in a way which is most appropriate to them and the interests of the wider community.  We will not close any long-stay mental hospitals unless it can be shown that adequate care services exist in the community.   We will strengthen co-operation between health and social services in the delivery of mental health services. Our recent Green Paper showed how this can be done. And we will monitor the progress of Health Authorities in developing proper mental health care plans.  HEALTH OF THE NATION  A modern health service is not just about treating illness, it is also about keeping people healthy. This is why we launched the Health of the Nation strategy in 1992 - the first time England has had a strategy for health. Its aim is to reduce illness and premature death by identifying common causes of ill health, like excessive smoking and obesity. Different groups in and outside the health service then work together to tackle the problems.  We are already seeing progress. Between 1990 and 1994, deaths from coronary heart disease among the over- 65s, the suicide rate, and the number of teenage pregnancies fell substantially. And last year we announced that environmental targets would be added to Health of the Nation.  Improved general health means fewer people requiring attention in hospitals and GP surgeries - and more resources to be spent on helping patients. Our Health of the Nation strategy is a vital part of our vision of creating a health service fit for the 21st Century.  A MODERN HEALTH SERVICE  Healthcare is changing fast. Modern technology is constantly increasing the range of treatments which are available. Conservatives believe that the benefits of these advances should be made available to patients on the basis of their clinical need, without regard to their ability to pay.  Furthermore we also believe that the NHS must have access to sufficient resources to allow it to invest in the facilities required to deliver up- to- date healthcare. Since 1979 capital investment in the NHS has proceeded at an unprecedented rate. In the future we believe these requirements will be best met in a partnership with the private sector which allows the private sector to improve the facilities in which NHS healthcare is delivered.  We will promote the Private Finance Initiative which will unleash a new flow of investment funds into the modernisation of the NHS.  The NHS is a British success story. It commands universal support in Britain. It is widely admired all over the world. Conservatives are proud of the part we playing in improving it still further.  6. BETTER PUBLIC SERVICES  The public sector is being transformed the world over. Britain is in the vanguard. Everyone else wants to learn from our vision of a smaller state doing fewer things and doing them better.  Old style public services were centrally planned with little information or choice for the public who used the service. Our reforms have made these services more responsive to the public by breaking up cumbersome bureaucratic structures and shifting power to small responsive local institutions and the people who work in them. The schools, hospitals and police have all been transformed in this way. We support the people who do, not the people who plan.  In order to get better standards we are liberating services from centralised control over capital. We will push forward our Private Finance Initiative to break down these old barriers.  We have made public services genuinely accountable, with useful information and real choices for the people who use them. We set tough standards and they will get tougher. The Citizen's Charter has raised standards of customer service. When these high standards are reached we recognise and reward excellence through our Charter Mark initiative. There are now 647 Chartermarks and we will aim for more than 2000 Chartermarks by the year 2000.  We will require all government agencies to apply for Chartermarks.   The days of the bureaucratic paperchase are behind us. The future is ""government direct"". We will harness the latest information technology to place the public sector directly at the service of the citizen. People will be able to use simple computer terminals to enter information directly. This will transform time-consuming transactions like completing a tax return or registering a new business.  PRIVATISATION AND COMPETITION  In 20 years, privatisation has gone from the dream of a few Conservative visionaries to the big idea which is transforming decaying public sector industries in almost every country in the world. Britain has led the way with this new industrial revolution: we can be proud of what we have achieved.  In 1979 the Government inherited a range of businesses which had come into the public sector for different reasons. Many were known for their poor standards of service, and most were making large losses.  Over the past eighteen years that situation has changed substantially. Privatisation has enhanced productivity, improved customer services, raised safety and environmental standards and substantially reduced prices.  Telephone, gas and electricity bills to the customer have fallen as never before. Telephone waiting lists are unknown, and water, gas and electricity disconnection's have fallen dramatically. Nearly (pound)40 billion in private sector funding has been committed to a major investment programme to meet higher quality water standards. We can now look forward to water prices falling over the years ahead.  Service standards have improved substantially. Before privatisation published service standards did not exist. Now industry regulators monitor legal requirements to provide quality services in a competitive environment. Refunds may be made when performance standards are not met.  Privatisation has benefited - and will continue to benefit - consumers, shareholders, employees, and taxpayers. In 1979 the then-nationalised industries required a £50 million per week subsidy from the taxpayer. In 1996 those now privatised companies paid taxes of £60 million per week.  We will ensure private ownership, competition and regulation continue to deliver lower prices and better services for consumers.   We will extend competition for domestic gas users, and introduce competition in the water industry, starting with large users.  The Post Office occupies an important part in national life. It comprises Counter Services, the Royal Mail and Parcelforce. The network of sub-post offices is vital and most are already run as private businesses. The Royal Mail provides a universal service at a standard price in every part of the United Kingdom. No one can imagine a stamp that does not bear the Queen's head. These characteristics must continue, but reforms are needed to allow the services to develop. The Royal Mail must face up to the challenges and opportunities that are arising from increasing competition and the international liberalisation of services.  We will guarantee to preserve the national identity, universal service and distinctive characteristics of the Royal Mail, while considering options - including different forms of privatisation - to introduce private capital and management skills into its operations.  We will transfer Parcelforce to the private sector whilst ensuring that every Post Office in the land continues to provide a full parcel service at an economical price.  Privatisation works. We will therefore continue to pass government activities into private ownership where this can bring benefits to consumers and taxpayers.  LOCAL GOVERNMENT  We are developing a new vision for local government.  We believe local government should take a lead in the planning and development of their communities. To achieve that, we have encouraged them to work in partnership with central government, with private enterprise, and other organisations in their community. The impact of local government is multiplied when they work in this way.  To encourage this partnership, we have developed the new approach of Challenge Funding. We set up a fund to meet a particular objective and then invite competing bids for the money. Those who form effective partnerships are far more likely to win those bids. The Single Regeneration Budget Fund, for example, has stimulated many working partnerships that are bringing new life to their communities.  This innovation has the potential to transform the financing of the public sector.  We will push Challenge Funding further to reward effective local government.   In addition, we are encouraging higher standards and more cost-effective provision of local services. Local authorities can enable things to happen rather than necessarily running themselves. They must look after the interests of users of their services - and that is often best done by being a purchaser, not an employer.  Standards of service are rising in many local authorities. There are, however, still great disparities between the best and worst performers, as the Audit Commission shows in their thought-provoking reports.  We will keep up the pressure for higher standards and improved value for money by insisting on compulsory competitive tendering.  The development of Challenge Funding and the shift in the role of local authorities from direct employers to purchasers of services will transform local authorities over the coming years. In the meantime we will, for so long as is necessary, retain the power to cap local authorities to protect taxpayers.  STRIKES IN ESSENTIAL SERVICES  Industrial relations in this country have been transformed. Insofar as there is a still a problem it is concentrated in a few essential services where the public has no easy alternative and strikers are able to impose massive costs and inconvenience out of all proportion to the issues at stake. We will protect ordinary members of the public from this abuse of power.  We will legislate to remove legal immunity from industrial action which has disproportionate or excessive effect. Members of the public and employers will be able to seek injunctions to prevent industrial action in these circumstances. Any strike action will also have to approved by a majority of all members eligible to vote and ballots will have to be repeated at regular intervals if negotiations are extended.   TRANSPORT  Our railways are already improving now they have been liberated into the private sector. Passenger numbers are up: more people are using the railways every day. Investment is up: Railtrack plans to spend (pound)4 million each day on improving stations and maintaining and renewing the network. The new train operators are committed to investing (pound)1.5 billion in new and refurbished rolling stock. And key fares are falling in real terms for the first time in a generation, with guaranteed price controls keeping fare increases below the level of inflation until at least 2003. We intend to build on this growing success story to create a thriving railway network for the new century.  We will complete the successful transfer of British Rail into the commercial sector.  We now want to draw in private investment to modernise London Underground and improve services to passengers.  We will bring forward plans to privatise London Underground. Proceeds from privatisation will be recycled in order to modernise the network within 5 years - creating an underground system to serve the capital in the 21st Century. We will regulate fares so they rise by no more than inflation for at least 4 years after privatisation. We will also protect services - including the Travel Card and concessionary fares.  After completing the modernisation of the network, the majority of the remaining surplus from privatisation will be channelled into additional support for transport investment in London and elsewhere in the country.  We will continue to encourage public transport. In particular, we will use the existing funding for local authorities to promote developments which make it easier to transfer from rail to bus.  We recognise the needs of road users, and will continue to work with the private sector to sustain our road building and maintenance programme. Already under the Private Finance Initiative the private sector is contributing some (pound)1 billion to investment in roads and achieving significant savings in construction costs. We will also tackle road congestion by introducing new regional traffic control centres, by extending the use of variable speed limits, and by ensuring that local authorities have the necessary powers to act. We will promote a cleaner environment by supporting a Europe-wide reduction in vehicle emissions, and encouraging the manufacture of more fuel efficient vehicles.  We will continue to build on our record of improving safety on roll-on roll-off ferries and cargo ships through higher standards of survivability and the measures in the Merchant Shipping Act.  We will continue to make it easier for people to travel by air. Already over the last 5 years opening up the market in Europe has led to more services and lower fares. We will build on that success in negotiations with the United States and other countries. We will also continue to encourage the development of regional airports offering new direct services to the rest of the world in the same way that we have already opened up new regional links with Europe and the United States. We will privatise the National Air Traffic System because it will be run better in the private sector.  Competition and enterprise are the best way to improve our transport system.  A SAFE AND CIVIL SOCIETY  OUR RECORD - A SAFE AND CIVIL SOCIETY  Spending on the police has doubled since 1979 after allowing for inflation. There are now about 16,000 more police officers than when we took office. 2,360 more constables have been recruited since the last election and the Government is giving Chief Officers the resources to recruit 5,000 extra police constables over the next 3 years.  Recorded crime has dropped in each of the last 4 years. It is now over 10% down on 1992 levels - more than half a million fewer offences - the biggest drop since records were first kept.  There are now 153,000 neighbourhood watch schemes in England and Wales - 38,000 more than in 1992 - covering 5.5 million homes. We have helped fund over 4,000 Closed Circuit TV schemes over the last 2 years for additional security.  Our national DNA database - the first in the world - now has over 112,000 samples on it. 3,300 matches have so far been made between suspects and crime stains.  The Government has increased the maximum penalty for taking a gun to a crime and for attempted rape to life imprisonment. Since 1985 the average sentence for violence against the person has risen by a third and for sexual offences by nearly 40%.  The number of cars stolen has fallen by nearly 20% in the last four years - that is about 100,000 fewer cars stolen.  We have built 22 new prisons since 1980. Slopping out has ended. No prisoners now sleep three to a cell designed for one. Prison escapes have fallen by 80% since the last election.  Mandatory drug testing has been introduced throughout the Prison Service. Home leave has been cut back - down by half in two years.  We have made witness intimidation a crime. 500 people were charged with that offence in 1995 alone.  We have stepped up the fight against drugs and organised crime, giving the Security Service powers to support the police and Customs and Excise in tracking down the serious criminals.  7. LAW, ORDER AND SECURITY  People have a right to sleep safely in their homes and walk safely on the streets. Governments have a duty to maintain that security.  Our reforms are aimed at ensuring that crime does not pay. And they are working - the pessimists and the scoffers are wrong. Recorded crime has fallen every year for the last 4 years. It is now 10% lower than it was in 1992. That is over half a million fewer crimes - the biggest drop since records were first kept in the middle of the 19th century.  But crime is still too high. We must do more. Our aim is to keep crime falling over the lifetime of the next parliament. This is what we will do.  SAFER COMMUNITIES  Anti-social behaviour and petty crime disrupt communities and spread human misery. The police are rightly now vigorously tackling problems such as graffiti, vandalism and drunkenness. Where such behaviour goes unchecked more serious crimes will follow.  We will support chief constables who develop local schemes to crack down on petty crime and improve public order.  Closed circuit television has proved enormously successful in increasing public safety.  We will fulfill the Prime Minister's pledge to support the installation of 10,000 CCTV cameras in town centres and public places in the 3 years to 1999. We will provide £75 million over the lifetime of the next Parliament to continue extending CCTV to town centres, villages and housing estates up and down the country that want to bid for support.   We will also continue to take other steps to improve the safety of our streets and communities. In this parliament we have given the police power to seize alcohol from under 18s caught drinking in public. The police have been given the power to stop and search in a specified area for up to 48 hours if they reasonably believe people to be carrying knives.  Identity Cards can also make a contribution to safer communities.  We will introduce a voluntary identity card scheme based on the new photographic driving licence. It will, for example, enable retailers to identify youngsters trying to buy alcohol and cigarettes or rent classified videos when they are under age.   TACKLING JUVENILE CRIME  A fifth of all crime is committed by under-18s. We are encouraging schools to reduce truancy through the publication of league tables and by supporting local projects to tackle the problem. We are developing a network of local teams to identify children who are at risk of turning to crime and to take early steps to address the factors which put them at risk.  We will encourage these local child crime teams to refer children from primary school age upwards who are at risk of, or actually, offending to programmes to tackle their behaviour and fully involve their parents.  The courts would be able to impose an order - a Parental Control Order - on the parents of children whom they believed could keep control of their children but were refusing to do so.  Courts will be given the power to attach conditions to Parental Control Orders. Conditions might include a requirement to keep their children in at night, taking their children to and from school, attending a drug rehabilitation clinic or going to sessions to improve their skills as parents. Parents who breached these conditions - in defiance of the court - would face a range of possible sanctions.  Appearing before a youth court should be a daunting experience for the juvenile concerned. All too often it is not. At the moment about a third of all juveniles appearing before the youth courts are discharged without any punishment at all. This sends all the wrong signals to youngsters - particularly first time offenders - who then feel they can get away with crime.  We will give the courts the power to impose speedy sanctions on youngsters, involving wherever possible an element of reparation to the victim. The probation service - rather than social services - will be responsible for enforcing community punishments for under-16s.  Persistent juvenile offenders need to be properly punished. We are piloting a tough new regime, with a heavy emphasis on discipline, at a young offender institution and at the military prison in Colchester. In 1994 we doubled the maximum sentence for 15-17 year olds to 2 years detention in a young offenders institution. We have given the courts the freedom to allow the publication of the names of convicted juveniles. We will give the courts the power to detain persistent 12-14 year old offenders in secure training centres once the places become available.  We have given the courts the power to impose electronically monitored curfews on 10 to 15 year old offenders. We will introduce pilots to test their effectiveness. If successful we will consider extending them nationwide.  CATCHING, CONVICTING AND PUNISHING  We back the police every inch of the way. There are now about 16,000 more police officers - and over 18,000 more civilians helping them - than when we took office. We are providing chief constables with the resources to recruit 5,000 extra police constables in the three years to 1999.  We support police initiatives to target the hard core of persistent criminals. Intelligence is crucial for this.  We will establish a national crime squad to provide an improved nationally co-ordinated approach to organised crime.  Once caught, criminals must be convicted and then properly punished. The public need to be protected. We have reformed the right to silence, despite opposition from Labour. The number of suspects refusing to answer police questions has nearly halved as a result.  We have piloted curfew orders for adult offenders. They have been shown to keep criminals indoors - curbing their freedom as a punishment - and keeping them out of trouble in the meantime.  We will extend electronically monitored curfew orders nationwide for those aged 16 and over.  Persistent offenders account for a high proportion of all crime. Prison works - not only as a deterrent, but in keeping criminals off the street. Those sent to prison are less likely to re-offend on release than those given a community punishment. We will provide another 8,500 prison places by the year 2000.  We will introduce minimum sentences for violent and persistent criminals to help protect the public more effectively, reversing Labour's wrecking amendments to our tough Crime Bill.  Anyone convicted of a second serious sexual or violent crime, like rape or armed robbery, will get an automatic life sentence.   Persistent house burglars and dealers in hard drugs will receive mandatory minimum prison sentences of 3 and 7 years respectively.   We will restore honesty in sentencing by ensuring that criminals serve the sentence intended without automatic early release.  SUPPORT FOR VICTIMS  Concern for the victim must be at the heart of our entire approach to the criminal justice system. We will continue to give strong backing to Victim Support.  We will give courts in all cases the discretion to allow witnesses to give evidence anonymously if they believe them to be at risk from reprisal.  We will also take action to allow a judge to stop a defendant from personally questioning the victim in rape cases and other cases where the victim is particularly vulnerable.  Conservatives are on the side of the victims not the criminal.  STRENGTHENING THE FIGHT AGAINST CITY CRIME  Crime that takes place through manipulation of financial accounts and markets is as serious as crime on the street.  The City's unchallenged position as Europe's most dynamic and successful financial centre owes a great deal to its reputation for honesty and fair dealing. We will help ensure that this reputation is maintained.  We will bring forward in the next Parliament a package of measures designed to modernise the current systems for dealing with City fraud.  This will include legislation to allow the Inland Revenue to pass confidential information to the police, the Serious Fraud Office and the financial regulators to assist in the investigation of cases involving serious financial fraud. We will also remove the remaining legal obstacles to the controlled exchange of confidential information between the police and the regulators in this kind of case.  FASTER JUSTICE  Justice delayed is justice denied. It is wrong that people who are innocent should face an excessive wait before the start of their trial. The guilty need to be held to account for their actions promptly. And victims should be given the chance to draw a line under their experience as quickly as possible. We are determined to speed up justice without diminishing the genuine rights of every citizen to a fair trial.  Last October the government set up a review of delays in the criminal justice system. It made a series of detailed recommendations. We see merit in those recommendations and will seek the views of interested parties. We believe that taken together they could dramatically speed up the prosecution process, bringing the guilty to justice and acquitting the innocent more quickly.  All defendants would appear in court the next working day after they were charged. At least half of them would be convicted the next day compared with just 3 per cent at the moment. And the time taken to bring juveniles to court would be cut from 10 weeks to a matter of days.  CIVIL JUSTICE  The civil justice system of this country is a vital part of its competitive economy and has a high international reputation. The commercial courts attract substantial litigation from all over the world, generating significant foreign earnings. We will seek to maintain the high standing of these courts.  We have greatly improved the service the civil courts provide for the aggrieved citizen. The simple procedure for small claims has been extended to claims up to (pound)3,000. For large claims the county court now provides an efficient local service with specialised courts in many locations around the country, leaving the High Court to deal with the more complex and difficult issues.  We will push ahead with the major reforms now under way which will greatly speed up the process and improve the delivery of justice without imposing additional burdens on the taxpayer.  THE LEGAL PROFESSION  We will ensure that the framework in which the legal profession operates is responsive to the changing needs of our people and is one in which unjustified restrictions have no place. We have, for example, given most solicitors rights of audience in the higher courts under appropriate conditions.  LEGAL AID  People are rightly concerned about the rising costs of legal aid. We have taken many steps to control the burden and to deny access to legal aid to the ""apparently wealthy"" - those who qualified technically, but whose lifestyles suggested they should not.  But more is required:  We will change the structure of legal aid to ensure that it, like other vital public services, functions within defined cash limits.   This will enable us to identify priorities and serve them much more efficiently than the present system.  DRUGS  Drugs are a menace to the very fabric of our society. They ruin the life of addicts and their families. They can destroy whole neighbourhoods. The promising youth of today can too easily become the sad dropouts of tomorrow, turning to crime and violence.  The Conservative Government has a comprehensive strategy, launched in 1995, committed to fighting drugs in communities and in schools. It is tough on criminals and vigilant at our ports. It is respected throughout the world. We spend over £500m every year in tackling all aspects of drug problems.  We will continue the fight against drugs through a co-ordinated approach: being tough on pushers; reducing demand by educating young people; tackling drug abuse at local level through Drug Action Teams; saying ""No"" to legalising drugs; and working with international agencies and foreign governments to resist the menace spreading.  This pernicious evil has to be fought by all of us.  A CONFIDENT, UNITED AND SOVEREIGN NATION  OUR RECORD - THE NATION  Many of our old cities have been rejuvenated through a partnership of public and private investment.  The area of green belt has doubled since 1979.  Water and air quality in the UK have improved significantly.  We are one of only a few nations on course to meet our commitment to return emissions of all greenhouse gasses to 1990 levels by 2000.  The Lottery has been established as the most successful in the world - raising £3 billion for good causes in a little over 2 years.  More support is now given to arts and heritage than at any time in our nation's history. We now provide nearly 20% more for the arts than the last Labour Government, over and above inflation.  British talent was this year nominated for 30 Oscars. British music is again receiving international acclaim. The industry is worth £2.5 billion, more than shipbuilding or electric components: one in 5 CDs and records sold anywhere has a British connection.  There is record investment in our sports facilities. Already the Lottery has provided £480 million for sport, including the planned British Academy of Sport, English National Stadium and for the first time direct funding for British athletes.  We have continued to stand up for British interests in Europe, protecting our opt-out of the Social Chapter, maintaining our border controls, and preserving our budget rebate - worth £18 billion since it was introduced.  We have the most professional armed forces in the World. We have modernised our nuclear deterrent by replacing Polaris with Trident.  8. THE BEST PLACE IN THE WORLD TO LIVE  Britain is admired the world over. Every year, millions of tourists travel here to enjoy our heritage and culture, our cities and countryside, our way of life. Our nation's history is an anchor in a sea of change. We need to protect, cherish and build upon what is great about our country, so our children grow up in a better Britain. We also must make sure that everyone, wherever they live, has the support of a strong, tolerant and civilised community.  Our aim is for this generation and future generations to take pride in Britain as the best place in the world to live.  BRITAIN'S CITIES  London is one of the world's greatest cities. It is livelier than ever. Our vision of its future is set out in a separate manifesto.  Many of our cities have undergone a complete transformation over the last decade. We have promoted partnerships - through schemes such as Urban Development Corporation, the Single Regeneration Budget and City Pride to attract private enterprise and investment back to inner-cities. These initiatives are bringing hope, opportunity, and prosperity to what were once wastelands of urban decline.  As the country thrives and becomes more prosperous, one of our central tasks is to apply the same approach to transform the legacy of soulless, decaying public housing estates. They are places that suffer from the very worst kind of poverty - poverty of aspiration.  We have already made a start - spending over £2bn over the last 10 years on improving 500 of the worst estates. And we have shown how it is possible to tackle the economic and social problems alongside new investment in buildings - where possible, bringing in a greater mix of public tenants and private housing to recreate a more balanced community. Now we will extend this approach, focusing the Single Regeneration Budget to launch a combined attack on crime, unemployment and under-achievement, and developing the government's partnership with the private sector to help fund the massive investment that will be required.  Over the next decade, we aim to raise some (pound)25bn of new private investment in housing estates by encouraging tenants in more than half of the remaining public sector housing stock to opt for transferring their homes to new landlords. These transfers will only occur where tenants choose this route to improve their estates.   We will use this approach to regenerate the worst housing estates and transform the lives of those who live on them - targeting support for programmes to improve education standards, employment and crime prevention alongside new private sector investment.  As well as this attack on poor housing, we will continue to help the homeless. We will carry through our planned extension of the Rough Sleeper Initiative from London to other big cities.  We will provide sufficient hostel places to ensure that no-one needs sleep out on the streets.  RURAL COMMUNITIES  Britain is blessed with some of the most beautiful countryside in Europe.  We need to protect the best of countryside whilst ensuring good jobs, and living conditions for people who live there.  We have to strike a balance: our rural communities must not become rural museums, but remain vibrant places to live and work. We will make sure government departments work together to ensure that balance is kept.  We will continue to protect the green belt from development making sure that derelict and under-used urban land is developed in preference to greenfield sites.  We will use the planning system to ensure that more new homes are built on reclaimed sites in our towns and cities. We will aim for more than 60 per cent of all new homes to be built on derelict sites.  This will reduce the pressure to build in our countryside and expand choice where it is needed most.  We will support our rural communities, by giving special rate support to small village shops and post offices. The planning system can do more to help too.  We will introduce a new Rural Business Use Class to encourage job creation in the countryside.   We will increase support for schemes which promote care for the countryside - like Countryside Stewardship.  We believe participation in traditional country pursuits, including fishing, is a matter for individuals. A Conservative Government will not introduce legislation that interferes with the rights of people to take part in these activities.  We will also encourage managed public access to private land - in agreement with farmers and landowners - but strongly resist a general right to roam, which would damage the countryside and violate the right to private property.  We aim to double Britain's forest cover over the next fifty years. We will continue to encourage tree planting by targeting grants, encouraging investment in wood processing, and using new freedoms with the reform of the Common Agricultural Policy.  AGRICULTURE AND FISHERIES  We will continue to provide robust support to the British beef industry through the BSE crisis until its long term strength is restored. We will vigorously pursue the eradication of BSE in the United Kingdom, as we have been doing successfully for the last eight years. We will spare no efforts in our fight against the unwarranted ban on British beef exports.  Public health and food safety have been the government's top priorities throughout the BSE crises.  We will tighten up control over food safety by appointing a powerful and independent Chief Food Safety Adviser and Food Safety Council to advise government.  We will continue to push for fundamental reform of the Common Agricultural Policy, moving away from production support to measures that will give our farmers the opportunity to compete while safeguarding the rural environment. We will ensure that no change to the Common Agriculture Policy unfairly disadvantages British farmers.  Fishing is a vital industry in many parts of coastal Britain. We will continue our fight to secure a prosperous long term future for the industry and sustainable management of our fish stocks.  We will insist at the IGC and elsewhere on measures to stop quota hopping and prevent the vessels of other countries from using UK fishing quotas.  The integrity of our 6 and 12 mile fishing limits is not negotiable. We reject any idea of a single European fishing fleet.  We believe that fishermen should have more say in decisions affecting their industry. We will press the European Commission to establish regional committees to give fishermen a direct influence in fishing policy. We will use these committees to develop new ways of managing quota and regulating fisheries which are more sensitive to the industry's needs.  ANIMAL WELFARE  A civilised society respects its animals. Britain will continue to take the lead in improving standards of animal welfare in Europe. In 1995 we secured a major breakthrough in the treatment of animals in transport; in 1996 we won victory in our campaign to ban veal crates throughout the EU. We are determined that standards should continue to rise and that all EU countries should have to meet them.  We will seek to ensure that all European countries have to raise animal welfare standards.  We are not going to take any risks with rabies. There may however be ways other than quarantine which maintain or increase protection for public health, while improving the welfare of pets and reducing the costs to travellers.  We will publish a Green Paper on rabies protection, setting out all the options including the existing controls, early in the new parliament.  BRITAIN'S ENVIRONMENT  Britain has an enviable track record in protecting our environment. Our rivers, beaches and water are cleaner and we are using our energy more efficiently. We are leading the world in reducing the level of the ""greenhouse gases"" that cause global warming and pressing for policies that will enable the world to sustain development without long-term damage to the environment. Our Green Manifesto is published separately.  We have clear objectives to build on this record. We will set tough, but affordable targets, with published environmental strategies to improve air quality and banish city smog - with tighter standards on vehicle emissions and pollution crackdowns around the country. We aim for sustained improvements in water quality, at a pace which industry and consumers can afford. We will develop labelling of products that gives consumers information to show the environmental impact of how they were made.  In addition, we will continue to use the tax system and other incentives to encourage the use of vehicles and fuel which do not pollute the environment. And, we will continue to explore policies based on the principle of polluter pays: those who contaminate land, pollute the environment or produce harmful waste should be made responsible for their actions and pay for the consequences.  BRITAIN - A TOLERANT COUNTRY  Tolerance, civility and respect have always been hallmarks of our nation. It is thanks to them that we have an excellent record on race relations.  Everybody, regardless of colour or creed, has the right to go about his or her life free from the threat of intimidation. We are taking tough action to tackle harassment. Under proposals in the Protection from Harassment Act 1997, it will be a crime to behave in a way which causes someone else to be harassed. The maximum penalty will be 6 months in prison.  Firm, but fair, immigration controls underpin good race relations. We will ensure that, while genuine asylum seekers are treated sympathetically, people do not abuse these provisions to avoid normal immigration controls.  A WORLD LEADER OF SPORTS, ARTS AND CULTURE  Britain is enjoying a cultural renaissance. British music, films, television, fashion, art and food are winning plaudits the world over. They add excitement, fun and enjoyment to our lives. Our success brings pride to everyone.  The National Lottery, which John Major set up, will pump billions of pounds into Britain's good causes. Its proceeds will weave a new, rich thread of opportunity and charity into the tapestry of British life. In addition to benefiting major national institutions, about half of the awards are for amounts under £25,000 - benefiting local communities up and down the country. We will encourage new ways of distributing awards to support the performing arts - through support for amateur productions and community events, providing more musical instruments, and helping productions tour round the country.  The National Lottery will also help us train and promote British sporting talent. The English National Stadium and British Academy of Sport, funded by the Lottery, will be new focal points for sporting events and excellence. We will encourage more young people play sport, by ensuring every school plays a minimum level of sport, including competitive sports, and developing a network of Sporting Ambassadors - sporting celebrities who will visit schools to inspire young people. We also encourage the Sports Council to use Lottery money to employ over 1000 additional community sports coaches to assist in Primary Schools.  The development of young talent is important in all fields.  We will encourage the use of Lottery money to train young athletes and artists, with revenue funding for bursaries, concessionary tickets to professional performances and support for young people's organisations and productions.  The Lottery will also fund our Millennium celebrations. They will be inspirational as well as enjoyable. We want these be a showcase of British excellence. Britain will be able to look back on past achievements with pride, and look forward with confidence.  9. EUROPE AND THE WORLD  Britain is a world leader as well as a European nation. Our economic strength, our history and our language make us a global trading nation with links right around the world. Only the United Kingdom is a member of the European Union, the United Nations Security Council, the Commonwealth, NATO and the Group of Seven leading industrial nations. In the Gulf, Bosnia, Cyprus and Northern Iraq, John Major has shown how our nation can contribute to world peace.  We will continue to work with international partners to secure peace and stability in areas of tension such as former Yugoslavia; in Kashmir; in Cyprus; and in the Middle East. We will promote reform of the United Nations to make it a more effective organisation for securing international stability. Britain will continue to deploy our outstanding Armed Forces as peacekeepers under the United Nations. And we will support the aspirations of the Poles, Czechs, Hungarians and others to join the European Union and NATO.  After the transfer of Hong Kong, we will work under the terms of the Joint Declaration to help sustain the prosperity and way of life of the people of Hong Kong and build on the substantial British interests that will remain.  We will continue to support the Commonwealth, our unique global network, to encourage the spread of democracy, as set out in the Harare Declaration. We will focus our aid programme to encourage sustainable development in countries that are growing towards self sufficiency under democratic government. We have taken the lead in alleviating the burden of debt for the world's poorest countries. We also have significant flows of private investment to developing economies. We are more than achieving the long term UN target of 1% of GDP for the transfer of wealth to less developed countries. We will continue to maintain a significant bilateral and multilateral aid programme reflecting the aspiration of meeting the UN's target of 0.7% of GDP for aid as a long-term objective.  We will also continue to provide leadership in Europe and internationally on environmental issues, building on the Rio Conference to encourage sustainable development - meeting our commitment to reduce Carbon Dioxide (CO2) emissions by 10% on 1990 levels by 2010 to prevent climate change. The Prime Minister has committed himself to attending the next UN Environmental Conference in June.  BRITAIN AND THE EUROPEAN UNION  We believe that in an uncertain, competitive world, the nation state is a rock of security. A nation's common heritage, culture, values and outlook are a precious source of stability. Nationhood gives people a sense of belonging.  The government has a positive vision for the European Union as a partnership of nations. We want to be in Europe but not run by Europe. We have much to gain from our membership of the European Union - in trade, in co-operation between governments, and in preserving European peace. We benefit from the huge trade opportunities that have opened up since Britain led the way in developing Europe's single market. We want to see the rest of Europe follow the same deregulated, enterprise policies that have transformed our economic prospects in Britain.  However, in June, the nations of the European Union will gather in Amsterdam to negotiate possible amendments to the Treaty of Rome. It is a moment of truth, setting the direction in which the European Union will go. It will also be crucial in ensuring that we have a relationship with the rest of Europe with which we can be comfortable.  A Conservative Government will seek a partnership of nation states. Some others would like to build a federal Europe. A British Conservative Government will not allow Britain to be part of a Federal European State.  The diversity of Europe's nations is its strength. As more nations join the European Union, it needs to become flexible not more rigid. We must also ensure that any developments which only include some Members do not work to the disadvantage of others.  Our priorities for Europe's development will be enlargement of the Community, completion of the single market, reform of the European Court of Justice, and further strengthening of the role of national parliaments. We will seek more co-operation between national governments on areas of common interest - defence, foreign policy and the fight against international crime and drugs. We also believe the European Union itself should do less, but do it better. So we have proposed incorporating the principle of subsidiarity - that the European Union should only do that which cannot be done by Member States acting alone - into the Treaty. This is how we are approaching the Inter-Governmental Conference.  We will argue for a flexible Europe which fully accommodates the interests and aspirations of all its Member States and where any new proposals have to be open to all and agreed by all. We will not accept other changes to the Treaty that would further centralise decision-making, reduce national sovereignty, or remove our right to permanent opt-outs.   We will retain Britain's veto and oppose further extension of qualified majority voting in order to ensure we can prevent policies that would be harmful to the national interest. We will defend the rights of national parliaments and oppose more powers being given to the European Parliament at the expense of national parliaments.   We will take whatever steps are necessary to keep our frontier controls. We will resist attempts to change the inter-governmental nature of co-operation in Justice and Home Affairs. We will not accept the development of new legal rights that extend the concept of European Citizenship.  Britain's rebate has so far saved British taxpayers £18bn and we will protect it.  One of the greatest challenges Europe faces is to cut unemployment and make its businesses competitive. Here Britain is leading the way. We will continue to argue for deregulation and lower costs on Europe's businesses, the policies that have helped give Britain one of the strongest economies in Europe. We will not put that achievement at risk by signing up to the Social Chapter, which would open the door to imposing the high costs of the European Social Model on British business. Once Britain accepted the Social Chapter we could not stop many of these damaging policies being imposed on us by Qualified Majority Voting.  We will insist that any new Treaty recognises that our opt out from the Social Chapter enables Britain to be exempt from the Working Time Directive, and prevents any abuse of our opt out. And, we will not accept a new employment chapter in any revised Treaty, which would expose British businesses to new costs.  We made it clear in the previous chapter that we will continue to work for further reform of the Common Agricultural Policy, and the lifting of the worldwide ban on British beef, and insist on measures to stop quota hopping by foreign fishing vessels.  Protecting Britain's interests demands tough, experienced negotiation. John Major has proved he has these qualities - including the resolve to say no when necessary even if that means being isolated. Labour have said they would never want Britain to be isolated in Europe: they would damage Britain's success by undermining our veto, signing up to the Social Chapter and following in others' footsteps - even where they lead in the wrong direction. They support policies that would fragment the United Kingdom's influence within a Europe of Regions. The Liberal Democrats welcome the end of the nation state. Only the Conservatives can be trusted to stand up for Britain in Europe: our national interest must be protected.  A SINGLE CURRENCY: OUR REFERENDUM GUARANTEE  The creation of a European single currency would be of enormous significance for all European States whether they are Members or not. We must take account of all the consequences for Britain of such a major development of policy.  John Major secured for us at Maastricht an opt-out from the commitment to enter a single currency. It is only because of this opt-out that we have the right to negotiate and then decide whether it is in Britain's interest to join.  It is in our national interest to take part in the negotiations. Not to do so would be an abdication of responsibility. A single currency would affect us whether we were in or out. We need to participate in discussions in order to ensure the rules are not fixed against our interests. The national interest is not served by exercising our option - one way or the other - before we have to.  For a single currency to come into effect, European economies will have to meet crucial criteria. On the information currently available, we believe that it is very unlikely that there will be sufficient convergence of economic conditions across Europe for a single currency to proceed safely on the target date of January 1st 1999. We will not include legislation on the single currency in the first Queen's Speech. If it cannot proceed safely, we believe it would be better for Europe to delay any introduction of a single currency rather than rush ahead to meet an artificial timetable. We will argue this case in the negotiations that lie ahead.  We believe it is in our national interest to keep our options open to take a decision on a Single Currency when all the facts are before us. If a single currency is created, without sustainable convergence, a British Conservative government will not be part of it.   If, during the course of the next Parliament, a Conservative government were to conclude that it was in our national interest to join a single currency, we have given a guarantee that no such decision would be implemented unless the British people gave their express approval in a referendum.  DEFENCE IN AN UNSTABLE WORLD  The old rivalries of the Cold War have been replaced by new tensions. Britain must be able to react rapidly to protect our security and interests around the globe.  Our armed forces are the most professional in the world. We have cut unnecessary bureaucracy and increased efficiency, and directed money to support our services in the frontline. We have made the changes necessary to adapt our services to the threats which we might now face. We have set out defence plans based on stable levels of funding. There is no need for a defence review, which would raise fear and uncertainty about the future.  We will continue to ensure the Services have the modern weapons they need to guarantee their superiority against potential aggressors. We will make sure we can conduct military operations throughout the world, and develop our capability to deploy the three services together and rapidly, including the ability to transport heavy equipment into an operational zone. We will take part in ballistic missile research so we can decide whether we should procure any such system for the United Kingdom.  We will continue to target our efforts on recruiting for the armed forces. We will set up an Army Foundation College, which will provide 1,300 places for 16 and 17 year olds who want to join the Army. We will also enable the reserve forces to play a more active role in operations. We appreciate the enormous value of cadet forces, and our current plans including resources to encourage their further development.  We will continue to support Britain's defence industry, and we will work with companies to identify the technologies of the future.  NATO will remain the cornerstone of our security. We will resist attempts to bring the Western European Union under the control of the European Union, and ensure that defence policy remains a matter for sovereign nations.  10. THE CONSTITUTION  Alone in Europe, the history of the United Kingdom has been one of stability and security. We owe much of that to the strength and stability of our constitution - the institutions, laws and traditions that bind us together as a nation.  Our constitution has been stable, but not static. It has been woven over the centuries - the product of hundreds of years of knowledge, experience and history.  Radical changes that alter the whole character of our constitutional balance could unravel what generations of our predecessors have created. To preserve that stability in future - and the freedoms and rights of our citizens - we need to continue a process of evolution, not revolution.  Conservatives embrace evolutionary change that solves real problems and improves the way our constitution works. In recent years we have opened up government, devolved power and accountability, and introduced reforms to make Parliament work more effectively. It is that evolutionary process that we are committed to continue.  OPEN, ACCOUNTABLE GOVERNMENT  In recent years we have taken significant steps to open up government to public scrutiny, and give individuals more information to hold government and public services to account.  We have introduced a code on access to government information, policed by the Ombudsman. We have published information on the workings of government previously held secret - including the composition of Cabinet Committees, and the structure of the Security and Intelligence Services. We have introduced a new Civil Service Code, and reformed the process for public appointments. We are pledged to legislate on the commitments in our 1993 White Paper on Open Government, including a statutory right of access by citizens to personal records held about them by the government and other public authorities. And we have set up the Nolan Committee and have implemented its proposals to ensure that the highest standards are maintained in public life.  But our reforms go even wider than that. We have transferred power from central bureaucracies to local organisations such as school governors and hospital trusts. We have introduced the Citizen's Charter. We have also required them to publish information on their performance - information which enables the local community to keep a check on standards and apply pressure where needed. Wherever possible, we are widening competition and choice in public services. We showed in Chapter 6 how we wished to push this agenda forward.  Regional government would be a dangerously centralising measure - taking power away from elected local authorities. We wish to go in the opposite direction, shifting power to the local neighbourhood - for example by giving more power to parish councils.  PARLIAMENT  Parliament - alongside the Crown and our legal system - is one of the three key institutions that uphold our constitution. The supremacy of Parliament is fundamental to our democracy, and the guarantee of our freedoms. The last 17 years have seen many changes to strengthen Parliament and make it more effective - the flourishing of select committees, new procedures to scrutinise European legislation, reform of Parliament's working day, and a budget that brings together tax and spending.  We have therefore already done much to improve the way Parliament works and will do more. We have accepted the proposal from the Public Service Select Committee and put before the House of Commons a clear new statement of the principles underlying ministerial accountability to Parliament.  All these developments have made Parliament open to the citizen, and the government more accountable. In the next session of Parliament we will continue this careful reform.  To give Parliament more time to consider legislation thoroughly we will extend the Queen's Speech to cover not only legislation for the immediate year but also provisional plans for legislation in the year after that.   This will mean that more draft bills will be subject to public scrutiny before they reach the floor of the House of Commons. It will give Select Committees more time to take evidence and report. And this should also mean better legislation.  We do not believe there is a case for more radical reform that would undermine the House of Commons. A new Bill of Rights, for example, would risk transferring power away from parliament to legal courts - undermining the democratic supremacy of parliament as representatives of the people. Whilst this may be a necessary check in other countries which depend upon more formalised written constitutions, we do not believe it is appropriate to the UK.  Nor do we favour changes in the system of voting in parliamentary elections that would break the link between an individual member of parliament and his constituents. A system of proportional representation would be more likely to produce unstable, coalition governments that are unable to provide effective leadership - with crucial decisions being dependent on compromise deals hammered out behind closed doors. This is not the British way.  We have demonstrated we are not against change where it is practical and beneficial. But fundamental changes which have not been fully thought through - such as opposition proposals on the House of Lords - would be extremely damaging. We will oppose change for change's sake.  THE UNION  The Union between Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland and England underpins our nation's stability. The Conservative commitment to the United Kingdom does not mean ignoring the distinctive individuality of the different nations. On the contrary, we have gone further in recognising that diversity than any previous government. We are publishing separate manifestos for Wales and Scotland.  While preserving the role of parliament at the centre of the Union, we have given new powers to the Scottish Grand Committee and Welsh Grand Committee - enabling Scottish and Welsh MPs to call Ministers to account and debate legislation which affects those countries - something that would be impossible with separate Assemblies. For the first time, Welsh members of parliament can ask their questions to Ministers in Welsh in Wales. Most recently we have similarly extended the basic powers of the Northern Ireland Grand Committee.  We believe this is the right way to go. By contrast, the development of new assemblies in Scotland and Wales would create strains which could well pull apart the Union. That would create a new layer of government, which would be hungry for power. It would risk rivalry and conflict between these parliaments or assemblies and the parliament at Westminster. And it would raise serious questions about whether the representation of Scottish and Welsh MPs at Westminster - and their role in matters affecting English affairs - could remain unchanged.  Nor do we believe it would be in the interests of the Scottish or Welsh people. A Scottish tax-raising parliament, for example, could well affect the choice of where new investment locates in the United Kingdom.  In a world where people want security, nothing would be more dangerous than to unravel a constitution that binds our nation together and the institutions that bring us stability. We will continue to fight for the strength and diversity that benefits all of us as a proud union of nations.  NORTHERN IRELAND  While we cherish the Union and Northern Ireland's place within it, we recognise that there exist within the Province special circumstances which require further action to be taken.  After a quarter of a century we wish to see the unique and originally temporary system of direct rule ended and a successful restoration of local accountable democracy achieved. We want to see this brought about in a form which carries the broadest agreement possible. And we want to see the rights, traditions and interests of all parts of the community recognised within any such agreement.  We will accordingly continue to pursue a policy of dialogue and negotiation with and between the democratic Northern Ireland parties. We will continue to underpin such negotiations with the guarantee that the constitutional position of Northern Ireland cannot and will not be changed without the broad consent of the people of Northern Ireland. At the same time we will continue to take whatever security measures are required to protect the people of Northern Ireland from those who seek to achieve their political goals by violent means.  We seek peace. But we will never be swayed by terrorist violence nor will we ever compromise our principles with those who seek to overthrow the rule of law by force.  A CHOICE OF TWO FUTURES  At this election the British people face a stark choice. A choice of two futures.  They can elect to continue down the road of success and achievement. An opportunity that has been hard won by the efforts and sacrifices of the British people. An opportunity that has only come about because successive Conservative governments have been determined to face up to the long term problems facing Britain, and take the tough steps needed to arrest our slow decline.  Or they can elect to take a huge risk with that future - the future of themselves, their children, their nation - by handing over the government of the country to politicians who have fought, opposed and denigrated every step that has been taken to restore Britain's economic health and standing in the world. Politicians whose own declared policies would burden the United Kingdom with new spending and taxation, new regulations, and new threats to the stability and sovereignty of the nation itself.  You can only be sure with the Conservatives.  OUR VISION FOR BRITAIN: 25 PLEDGES FOR THE NATION  THE ENTERPRISE CENTRE OF EUROPE  TAX AND SPENDING. Keep tight control of public spending priorities, aiming for our target of a 20p basic rate of income tax over the next parliament.  PRICES AND MORTGAGES. Stick to the policies which have delivered the lowest inflation levels and mortgage rates for a generation, meeting our inflation target of 2.5 % or less.  JOBS. Protect jobs by keeping Britain out of the European Social Chapter; build on our record of falling unemployment; and help get the long term unemployed back to work - including by requiring those on benefit for some time to undertake work experience on a community project.  ENTERPRISE. Support growth and investment by keeping Britain the lowest tax major economy in Europe, pursuing Britain's global trade opportunities and curbing unnecessary regulations.  SMALL BUSINESS. Reform business rates to help small businesses.  THE FUTURE. Keep Britain ahead in the technology of the future, encouraging new entertainment and information services, and using the Millennium Lottery Fund to give people access to new computers and information links in schools, libraries, and other public places.  OPPORTUNITY AND OWNERSHIP FOR INDIVIDUALS AND FAMILIES  HELP FOR FAMILIES. Give priority to reducing tax bills for families looking after dependent children or relatives by allowing one partner's unused personal allowance to be transferred to a working spouse where they have these responsibilities.  HELP FOR CARERS. Help family members with heavy responsibilities caring for a relative to take a much needed break through a new Respite Care Programme.  OWNERSHIP. Encourage schemes that help employees build a shareholding in the company they work for, alongside tax benefits for other savings schemes.  PENSIONS. Transform pensions by providing all young people entering the workforce with a personal pension fund paid for by a rebate on their national insurance contributions, while maintaining a state pension guarantee.  CARE IN OLD AGE. Make it easier for people to afford the cost of care in old age without giving up their house and savings.  SCHOOL STANDARDS. Guarantee school standards by intervening directly to raise standards where schools or local education authorities are letting children down.  SCHOOL CHOICE. Widen choice and diversity in schools, with more freedom for schools to develop their own character, more specialist schools, and a grammar school in every town where parents want that choice. We will also maintain our nursery voucher scheme offering a choice of places for parents of all 4 year olds.  WORLD CLASS HEALTH AND PUBLIC SERVICES  NHS FUNDING PLEDGE. Continue, year by year, to increase the real resources committed to the NHS, so NHS spending will continue to share in a growing economy.  FAMILY DOCTORS. Enable all family doctors to provide a wider range of services in their surgeries and in practice-based cottage hospitals - offering faster and more local treatment.  CITIZEN'S CHARTER. Continue to improve the standards and value for money of Britain's public services, giving those who use them more information and, where possible, wider choice.  ESSENTIAL SERVICES. Introduce measures to protect the public against strikes that cause excessive disruption to essential services.  A SAFE AND CIVIL SOCIETY  PUBLIC SAFETY. Support local police schemes to crack down on petty crime, and continue our funding for the installation of TV security cameras in town centres and public places that want them throughout the next parliament.  JUVENILE CRIME. Give the courts power to impose speedy sanctions on youngsters, including an element of reparation to the victim; and continue our war against drugs.  PERSISTENT CRIMINALS. Ensure persistent house burglars and dealers in hard drugs receive mandatory minimum prison sentences.  A CONFIDENT, UNITED AND SOVEREIGN NATION  QUALITY OF LIFE. Continue the renaissance of our towns and cities, in particular harnessing private capital to regenerate the worst public housing estates; continue to protect our countryside and heritage; and use the National Lottery to help promote British sports, arts and culture.  THE ENVIRONMENT. Maintain our international leadership role in protecting the environment, and continue improving air and water quality at home alongside effective conservation of our wildlife.  THE NATION. Maintain the unity of the United Kingdom and preserve the stability of the Nation through an evolutionary - rather than revolutionary - approach to constitutional change.  EUROPE. Seek a partnership of nation states in Europe, and not allow Britain to be part of a federal European state.  THE POUND. Guarantee that Britain will not join a single currency in the next parliament unless the British people give their express approval in a referendum.  We will harness private capital to regenerate the worst housing estates and transform the lives of those who live on them.   We will seek a partnership of Nation States in Europe. We will not allow Britain to be part of a Federal European State.   We have given a guarantee that Britain would not join a Single Currency in the next Parliament unless the British people give their express approval in a referendum."
"SNP",199705,"What Scotland needs now! The SNP are proposing a fully-costed manifesto for an independent Scotland that is more detailed and better researched than ever before. There is a better future for Scotland with Independence -when we start investing in Scotland instead of subsidising London - and this document proves it.  Scotland Needs BETTER HEALTH - new investment in a true National Health Service to restore standards and provide quality comprehensive care, free at the point of need. Scotland Needs WELL RESOURCED EDUCATION - funding for teachers, investment in schools, free pre school education and the restoration of decent student grants. Scotland Needs DECENT HOMES - new houses, a renovation programme, the transfer of housing debt from local government and an end to homelessness. Scotland Needs MORE JOBS - a business tax regime that encourages growth, a determination to achieve full employment and a fair tax system that encourages employment. Scotland Needs SOCIAL JUSTICE - a pensioners package , the restoration of benefits to young people, and the abolition of means testing for care of the elderly. Scotland Needs INDEPENDENCE - the only way in which Scotland can put its wealth to work and care for its people again. THE SNP MANIFESTO 1997 1: A Nation Once Again Now theres ane end of ane auld sang were the words of the Chancellor of Scotland, when he signed the Treaty of Union of 1707 submerging from view for almost three centuries the independent nation of Scotland. But he was wrong. The song of Scotland - the steady rhythm of our past , the energetic bustle of our present, and the heady promise of our future - did not die in 1707. Scotland still exists despite the determined efforts of those who rule us to diminish, dismiss and deride our national aspirations. Scotlands institutions in the law, education, administration and in sport still have their distinctive national characteristics despite a constant erosion by the Westminster Parliament. What they need to revive and renew them - and what we need to revive and renew us - is the beating heart of an independent Scottish Parliament that expresses the sovereign will of the people who live here. For two hundred and ninety years Scotland has remained within a United Kingdom which has contributed less and less to our well being. Scotland has the potential to be a rich and vibrant economy yet we export our wealth south of the border: Scotland has a part to play in the building of our continent, and yet we are not permitted to speak for ourselves. Scotland has a home to offer to those from many backgrounds and much to give on the world stage and yet we are living in the shadow our neighbour, who speaks for us but not of us. And Scotland has the skills and resources to be free, but is denied its democratic right to self government. Yet Scotland can be a real and independent nation again. All we need is the assent of the people. At this General Election we can give that assent. We can begin a process that will result in the restoration of self confidence and the creation of a modern democracy in the mainstream of European life. We can express our dissatisfaction with the stale and sterile politics of the London parties - New Labour and Old Tory alike. And along with many hundreds of thousands of Scots, we can all vote SNP in the certain knowledge that only the SNP can make any difference to Scotland and to the lives of those who live here. This manifesto outlines the way in which the SNP wish to set Scotland free, and the promises that the SNP make about our country and how it should be run. These promises will allow Scotland to win again. For if the SNP wins, so does Scotland Its as simple as that. SNP President and European Parliamentary Leader There is an enormous bank of goodwill towards Scotland in the rest of Europe, and we have friends in countries far and wide who would welcome our freedom. We are an internationalist people, who look outwards to the rest of the world - in contrast to the insular, Little Englander mentality at Westminster.  THE SNP MANIFESTO 1997 2: Scotland - the Facts Treasury Spokesperson Scotland is a rich country, with a wealth of natural resources. Since 1979, Scotland has sent £27 billion more to the London Treasury than we have received in return. With Independence, we can make Scotland the lion economy of Europe - delivering fair tax for individuals, and a competitive edge for Scottish business.  The choice of how to vote at a General Election can be dictated by tradition, reason or emotion. But whatever the basis for your choice will be, it is important first to know the truth about our country and our prospects as its citizens. Over the past few years the SNP and Scotland have been subject to a whole range of smears and fears manufactured by political opponents. At the outset of our manifesto it is important to set aside those baseless attacks in a strong and positive manner. Labour and the Tories attack and attempt to undermine Scottish self confidence because it is a threat to their electoral prospects. They peddle fear, we offer hope. The SNP encourages all who live in Scotland to fulfil their potential. The facts are these: SCOTLAND IS A WEALTHY NATION. When our share of North Sea output is taken into account, an Independent Scotland would become the eighth richest nation in the developed world. Scotland saves more, produces more and exports more per head than England. SCOTLAND PAYS HER WAY IN THE WORLD. The Treasury has admitted that in the last eighteen years we have sent £27,000,000,000 more to London than we have received. In the next five years we will do the same with £12,500,000,000 of our wealth. 3 Scotland can afford many of the things our citizens want, while still reducing the inherited burden of our share of the UK national debt. SCOTLAND, ON INDEPENDENCE, WILL AUTOMATICALLY BECOME A FULL MEMBER OF THE EUROPEAN UNION: European legal , political and constitutional opinion on this matter is quite clear. SCOTLAND WILL HAVE OPEN BORDERS WITH ENGLAND: modern European countries have abolished controlled internal frontiers and our close family and trading ties with England will not be interrupted in any way by Scottish Independence. Only political union will end - our social union will be as strong as ever, and indeed improved by our new equal status as good neighbours. PENSIONS AND INVESTMENTS WILL BE UNAFFECTED BY INDEPENDENCE: the European Union already legislates for such transfers. SCOTLAND WILL ESTABLISH A MODERN EFFICIENT AND APPROPRIATE DEFENCE FORCE in keeping with our traditions and best practice throughout our continent. Scotland does not need nuclear weapons. THERE WILL BE FULL CITIZENSHIP AND A CONTINUING RIGHT OF RESIDENCE FOR EVERYONE WHO CURRENTLY LIVES HERE. An Independent Scotland will protect in its written constitution residency rights for all those living here , or entitled to live here, at the time of independence whether or not they become Scottish Citizens. Citizenship will be established on the basis of residency or birth. Membership of the European Union will also permit residence from citizens from other European Union members. SCOTLAND WILL BECOME A WEALTHIER, FREER NATION FOR ALL ITS CITIZENS: Scotland today is being kept held back by the Union with England. An independent Scotland will be a magnet for investment and our Bill of Rights will protect every citizen from government interference - something that Britain does not do - and establish social justice in our land. THE SNP MANIFESTO 1997 2: Scotland - the Facts NATIONAL INDEPENDENCE is the normal status for wealthy small nations. Over 50 countries have become independent from Britain since 1945 and NONE of them have applied to become colonies or dependencies again. Nearly half the independent nations in the world are smaller than Scotland - 25 out of the 35 most prosperous nations are small nations! SCOTLAND WILL BE ABLE TO CHOOSE ANY GOVERNMENT IT LIKES AFTER INDEPENDENCE: in the first elections after independence the SNP will stand as a political party, but Scots will be able to choose any party they like. Proportional Representation will ensure that Scottish governments are broadly based and that all parts of the country are fairly represented - as will be women and ethnic minorities. Cabinet Secretary While the London-based parties hand down their policies from on high, the SNP have developed a detailed set of policies that are best for Scotland by using the democratic structures of the Party. And we have consulted widely with organisations outside our party, in order to ensure that our policies are fully in tune with the needs of the people.  THE SNP MANIFESTO 1997 3: Gaining Independence Cabinet Chief Secretary Measures to help business, especially small business, are vital. Small business is the engine of growth and for too long the UK has just ignored the potential and needs of those who contribute so much.  A vote for the SNP is a vote for Independence - it is also a vote to encourage change, because only when the SNP is strong do the other parties pay any attention to Scotland . Constitutional Change has been promised to Scotland by the British parties for over 100 years - but nothing has happened. Nothing will happen unless the SNP is strong and determined, and attracting the support of the people of Scotland. New Labours scheme for a Scottish assembly is fatally flawed, and will deliver no real power. The Tories are stuck in the bunker of no change whilst virtually the whole of Scotland is now scunnered by their anti-Scottish actions. Only the SNP offers a clear , logical and achievable blueprint for progress. Scotland can regain its independence at any General Election. After the election of a majority of SNP MPs,the SNP will immediately initiate negotiations for independence with the UK government. In parallel with these negotiations, we will initiate talks with the European Union in order to facilitate the right conditions for independent representation. At the conclusion of this period (which is likely to take between six and twelve months) the people of Scotland will be asked to approve the independence settlement in a simple one question referendum. On achieving the assent of the people of Scotland, independence will be declared and, after the formal establishment of an independent country within Europe, a fresh General Election will be held to elect a new government. There are many precedents for such a process: indeed during 1996 a committee of respected academics brought forward the final report of a study of Scotlands route to independence5 which clearly set out the steps to be followed. During this study examples from other parts of the world were looked at closely. In the twentieth century the road to Independence is well trodden, and well signposted by those that have gone before. THE SNP MANIFESTO 1997 4: A Scotland for all her People An independent Scotland will have a written constitution and Bill of Rights. This means that Scots will be citizens, not subjects. They will be protected from the type of arbitrary interference that is the hallmark of Westminster government, and they will be able to force the state to honour its commitments to them. Almost every country in the world has a written constitution: and virtually every democratic country in the world makes sure that citizens are guaranteed their rights. A modern Scotland must have the same concern for law and liberty . Earlier this year the SNP published its full constitutional proposals 6 which have been arrived at after lengthy and wide ranging consultation. Amongst the SNPs promises to Scotland are: The protection of basic human rights, including the right of free expression and assembly, the right to housing , education and free health care and the right to decent working conditions and a minimum wage. The rights of citizens in an independent Scotland will be at least as wide-ranging as those offered under the European Convention on Human Rights, which will be incorporated into the law of Scotland. The establishment of a single chamber parliament elected by proportional representation which is modern in character and which in gender, ethnic origin and geographical representation accurately mirrors Scottish society as a whole. The franchise will be extended to include all those aged 16 and over. Legislation will require public consultation, may be initiated by public petition as well as by members of the Scottish Parliament, and a system of strong standing committees will supervise and regulate proceedings. Final legislation, having passed the Parliamentary process, will be approved on behalf of the people by the Chancellor of the Parliament, not subject to the mumbo jumbo of Royal assent. The balanced parliament, elected fairly, and a strong investigative committee system will replace the offensive and archaic House of Lords as the mechanisms to ensure properly thought through legislation. Membership of a legislative body secured only by accident of birth or political patronage has no place in a modern democracy. The SNP propose the reform of the Monarchy which, while allowing the Queen and her successors to remain Head of State, would ensure that their duties and payments were clearly and openly understood. In the absence of the Queen from Scotland the elected Chancellor (Speaker) of the Scottish Parliament will act as Head of State. The protection of the rights and responsibilities of Local Government will be protected by means of entrenchment in the constitution. Local Authorities will also be elected by proportional representation. Citizens of Scotland, wherever they have come from, will be full participants in a twenty first century democracy, not subjects of an outmoded and decaying eighteenth century state. That change alone will refresh and invigorate Scottish life. Cabinet member Over many years, I have seen the policies which the people of Scotland support overturned by an unrepresentative Westminster Parliament, which is distant from Scottish concerns. Only by getting a real Parliament of our own in Scotland can we introduce the policies that are best for Scotland.  THE SNP MANIFESTO 1997 5: Working in a Better Scotland Independence is vital for our future; but independence is not an aim on its own. The purpose of independence is not just to free Scotland but to free Scots - all the people who live in Scotland The Tory Government has been responsible for a vast increase in the National Debt, and an Independent Scotland would of course inherit a proportion of that debt, estimated to be around £38 billion. An SNP Government would commence a programme of repaying this debt , aiming to reduce the amount spent in interest and to free resources for further investment in the future. The debt repayment will amount to a total of £6. 6 billion in the first four years of Independence. Jobs and Employment The SNP aims for full employment - an achievable goal that is integral to the growth of the Scottish economy, the delivery of a high standard of living and the development of a secure and inclusive society in which every individual contributes and plays a constructive role. The SNPs four year budget will result in the creation of  an additional 100,000 new jobs; in addition our National Apprenticeship scheme will increase the number of young people going on from school to meaningful training and through that route into useful work. In addition to the immediate jobs boost that independence will produce, the creation of new jobs will come about as Scottish business is assisted to develop and compete. The key to such development will be the introduction of a sensitive and targeted corporate tax structure, allied to important initiatives to encourage small businesses that do not pay corporation tax. Business Taxation The SNP is the only party in a generation to enter a General Election fully committed to a reduction in business taxation. In government the SNP will Cut the standard rate of corporation tax by approx. 10% from 33p to 30p Cut the small companies rate of corporation tax by 22% from 23p to 18p Limit the increase in the Business Rate Multiplier to the increase in the RPI Phase in banded business rates with benefit targeted at smaller enterprises and with no increase for larger companies. Abolish Class IV National Insurance Contributions. These proposals will be phased in over a four year period. We have allocated an average of £250 million per year from our budget for the creation of a Business Tax Reduction fund to pay for these measures. New Investment In addition to a innovative business tax regime, Government funding will be provided for priority economic projects such as industrial expansion, modernisation, agricultural diversification and the introduction of new technologies. An additional £120 million over four years will be provided to enhance research and development of new products and processes. This will ensure that full advantage is taken of the intellectual capacity and scientific and technological innovation that is to be found in rich abundance in our universities and colleges, and in many of our businesses. THE SNP MANIFESTO 1997 5: Working in a Better Scotland Exports and Skills A Scottish Export Unit will also assist in building our export trade and focusing the attention of Scottish industry on the need to expand its excellent record in this field and will provide a massive boost to the international profile of Scottish business. A Scottish Skills Foundation will be established to bring international best practice in skills and innovation training to bear on Scottish business and industry. Tourism The SNP has budgeted for a doubling of the Scottish Tourist Boards advertising and promotions budget and will assist the Tourism industry - which contributes in excess of £2.2 billion to the Scottish economy and employs over 177,000 people - to fulfil its potential. Business Growth and Fair Trading With the SNPs commitment to Defence Diversification (see Chapter 9), to a modernised transport and communications infrastructure (See Chapter 8) and with a successful Scottish approach to attracting investment the prospects for job creation and business birth, growth and survival will be better than ever before. An SNP government will provide a context for business that is fair and flexible: a Merger and Take-overs panel will ensure competitive practices and prevent asset stripping which has destroyed many Scottish companies over the past 20 years; a Fair Trading Unit within a Scottish Department of Industry, Technology and Employment will inherit and strengthen the responsibilities of the current utility regulators and legislation will ensure that the practice of delayed payment that damages small businesses is outlawed. The Social Chapter and Trade Unions A fair and flexible business environment will flourish if accompanied by active partnership with trade unions: the SNP Charter for Trade Unions will guarantee Trade Union rights whilst ensuring that their responsibilities are enforceable at law. Scottish endorsement of the EU Social Chapter will encourage Unions and employers to observe best practice that enhances constructive and profitable co-operation. The introduction of a minimum wage (after discussion and with consensus) set at half median male earnings will be accompanied by an implementation plan developed in association with employers which assists smaller businesses to take this vital social step forward. Fair Personal Taxation For those in work, a fair personal tax system is an essential motivator: the SNP aim to introduce a starter rate of income tax at 15p over the first four years of government. For middle income earners the bands of income at which the basic rate is levied will be expanded by 15 per cent. This means that the top rate will not kick in until earnings exceed £30,000. In keeping with the belief that those who are best rewarded should contribute slightly more in order to assist delivering a just society , the ceiling on National Insurance contributions will be removed. Taken together these proposals will mean that there will be a drop in taxation for most, with a marginal increase in taxation for those earning above £26,500 per year. 85% of male employees and 95% of female employees will pay less tax. But all will benefit from a more prosperous country and a fairer society. Industry, Technology and Employment Spokesperson Instead of the Tories fiddled unemployment figures, we need a real Parliament in Scotland to create real jobs, and bring about a real cut in the dole queues. Only with Independence can we develop an economic strategy in line with Scottish conditions, and the SNP will prioritise investment in training and exports. Over four years, we can create 100,000 more jobs.  THE SNP MANIFESTO 1997 5: Working in a Better Scotland These proposals are in keeping with the basic Scottish belief in progressive taxation and the sharing of responsibility according to the ability to pay. We will also cut VAT on Domestic fuel from 8% to 5% , the minimum allowed under EU regulations but will also negotiate with the EU to seek a new regime to take account of climatic conditions in Northern Europe, thus allowing the eventual abolition of this tax. The economic and employment priorities of an SNP Government will be to Move toward full employment Achieve sustained growth along with increased investment Secure continuing low inflation Establish International Economic Credibility Introduce a competitive business tax system Legislate for a fair personal tax system Build exports and inward investment Strengthen the infrastructure and skills base Adopt the Social Chapter and the Minimum Wage. Introduce the SNP Charter for Trade Union Rights THE SNP MANIFESTO 1997 6: Living in a Better Scotland Job creation, business growth and economic success at home and abroad are aims that Scotland should aspire to given its wealth of talents and its strong resource base. But those underpinning strengths in the Scottish economy must also give rise to the development of social justice, education for life, health and public services which the Scottish people need and deserve. Scots should be encouraged to take advantage of arts and leisure opportunities and to have their lives enriched by such pursuits. And all these developments must take place in society that is determined to be free of crime and its effects. Scotland can afford to look after its citizens. The Scottish National Party is commited to a socially just Scotland - the type of Scotland which the Tories have systematically tried to destroy for 18 years: A Scotland in which poverty is eradicated and those in need are assisted to the maximum degree possible; the Scotland that all Scots want. Freedom from Poverty In our society there will always be a need for supporting those who cannot work, either through incapacity or for a variety of short-term reasons. Government must also use the benefits system to assist those who are vulnerable - the very young, the old and those who are incapacitated - and to eliminate the effects of poverty. An SNP government will increase Child Benefit to £12.50 per week per child and maintain entitlement until a child has left school. Child Benefit is a powerful means of tackling poverty as it is paid directly to the childs principal carer. The annual cost of this measure wil £132 million by year 4 of an independent government. Benefit will be restored to 16 and 17 year olds immediately, as the Tory removal of such benefits has been a strong contributory factor in the rise of youth homelessness and youth crime. Education and training - with proper financial support - is the best way to assist young people, but they must not be put in the position of suffering poverty and alienation because society will not assist them. A Pensioners Package The SNP is strongly committed to eradicating the scourge of fuel poverty particularly so as Scotland is an energy rich nation. Our Pensioners Package already forms the basis for action of fuel poverty for SNP councils: we will ensure that the entire package is implemented at a national level - a package that will increase the state retirement pension by £3 a week for a single person and £5 a week for married couples as a first step towards achieving parity with the higher European pension levels; introduce a Cold Climate Allowance of £9. 20 for all pensioners and others on benefits; remove standing charges from electricity, gas and telecom services for pensioners; and abolish means testing for the residential care of elderly. These measures will provide real relief from hardship and enhance social justice. In particular, the removal of standing charges provides a much more efficient and targeted way of making privatised utilities contribute to society than a one-off windfall tax, while the abolition of means testing will remove a major indignity from old people and allow them to enjoy the fruits of their retirement without undue worry or stress. Health and Social Policy Spokesperson In an independent Scotland, economic prosperity and social justice will go hand in hand. We will use our wealth to invest in the health service, deliver a Cold Climate Allowance to pensioners and those on benefits, and abolish means testing for the long-term care of the elderly.  THE SNP MANIFESTO 1997 6: Living in a Better Scotland A Real Scottish National Health Service Social justice also requires a new approach to the Scottish Health Service. The SNP will first of all establish an independent Health Commission, chaired by the Health Minister, which will consist of representatives of all political parties in the Scottish Parliament along with health professionals and representatives of local health care delivery agencies. Within the context of the health budget set by government, this commission will plan the strategic delivery of health services. Local Health Commissions will undertake a subsidiary role in local planning of health care. The SNP believe that free health care at the point of need is a fundamental right and in order to provide such care we must remove the distorting distraction of the Tories internal market in the health service. By removing the tiers of accountants, administrators and middle managers we will abolish the artificial split between purchasers and providers of health care and will introduce an integrated health system which is administered and planned nationally but delivered locally. This structural change is important - as is providing additional resources and finding a way in which the broad strategic priorities for health can be taken out of the day to day political arena. We will provide an additional £35 million per annum for the Scottish Health Service which, coupled with savings on bureaucracy (which consumes a staggering 12% of NHS expenditure) will provide a major and immediate boost for healthcare delivery. The SNP will establish an on going national audit of health care designed to provide creative feedback and raise local and national standards. Dentistry will be re-integrated into the NHS and we accept the view of the dental profession that capitation fees must be adjusted to take account of Scotlands dental health needs which are greater than those elsewhere in the UK. This and other measures will encourage dentists to return to the Scottish Health Service. Prescription charges have increased, under this Tory government, from 20p to the current £5.65. The system can be effectively reformed both by allowing patients to pay the real cost of drugs if these are below the prescription charge levels and by spreading the burden of charges more fairly. The SNP will review the issue of charges and exemptions for those with long term mental illness who are not presently allowed exemptions. Health care in a modern Scotland must be preventative as well as curative. An SNP Government will ban cigarette advertising and increase tobacco tax both to encourage more to give up, or not to start smoking, and to recover a small proportion of the costs of treatment of tobacco related illnesses by the National Health Service. We will also prioritise the improvement of nutritional standards in Scotland, using best practice both to encourage healthy eating and to protect the nations health by enforcing high standards in the production and distribution of food. Care in the community is a laudable aim but it requires support with resources and with an infrastructure that the Tories have constantly eroded. The SNP will ensure that Local Health Commissions review the local delivery of care in the community, allocating resources to it as required. THE SNP MANIFESTO 1997 6: Living in a Better Scotland The provision of care in the community has a direct bearing on adequate local government funding, and statutory obligations imposed on local government must be backed up with financial provision. So must any need to increase the involvement of voluntary organisations who are key facilitators in the provision of care. The cost of democratic control of the Health Service through such Commissions will be considerably less than the present internal market which lacks both democracy and efficiency. Enabling the Disabled As many as one in 10 of the worlds population suffers some form of disability, but society is still reluctant to legislate to ensure full civil rights for disabled people, and to improve the quality of life so that all disabled people can fulfil their potential and contribute to the society of which they are members. The SNP will introduce measures, in the Bill of Rights and in other legislation, to secure full rights, to enforce standards of building access and to help disabled people obtain and retain employment as they wish and are able. The SNP will implement its Charter for the Disabled to enable valuable members of society who are presently often excluded from the mainstream, but who have much to contribute. Protecting Scotlands People Whilst food safety is not primarily a health issue, until structures, controls and procedures go wrong, there is a clear need now to restore the reputation of the Scottish food industry and to provide a mechanism for public control of food quality. The SNP has been in the forefront of the campaign for an independent food safety agency, free of the pressure from the producers and able to take a proactive stance in securing the highest standards. An independent Scottish Food and Consumer Health Agency will have a wide remit: it will supervise public health issues, working through local authorities and through local public health departments; it will regulate food processing and handling and introduce clear controls that will better the European norm; it will consider public nutrition and health issues in their broadest sense and will assist in the process of promoting better eating , recognising that one of the principal barriers to a healthy diet is poverty. It will also work closely with the producers to instil the best practices and provide a certification of quality that in time will be the passport to domestic and international success for the Scottish food industry. Freedom from Crime Freedom from crime is an important freedom for many Scots; and whilst crime levels in Scotland have fallen in recent years many communities are still subject to unacceptable levels of vandalism, burglary and violence. The SNP has supported initiatives that seek to reduce crime by means of a zero tolerance approach: we will encourage such initiatives throughout Scotland and support them with additional resources for Scotlands police forces. Zero Tolerance brings improvement to communities by focusing attention on community crimes such as vandalism, petty burglary and other such anti-social activities. By so doing it increases community confidence and pride. It is an ideal solution for every part of Scotland and particularly for urban areas. SNP Vice President An independent Scotland will be a model European democracy, with a written Constitution and Bill of Rights. Proportional representation will ensure that the Parliament represents all of Scotland and we will have done with unelected Peers in London deciding the laws of our nation.  THE SNP MANIFESTO 1997 6: Living in a Better Scotland There are many practical steps that can be taken to cut down on petty or organised crime against property. One such scheme, which has been vigorously promoted by the SNP and which has the support of a number of organisations, is one which combats the £1.3 billion used-vehicle fraud that takes place every year. A register of vehicles will be established which will allow purchasers of second hand vehicles to check that their intended purchase is legitimate. The cost added to a purchase will be around £5.00 but the peace of mind afforded will be great. Much police time is wasted for want of such simple and cost effective solutions: much is also wasted in waiting for court appearances and the court system needs better resourcing. The Procurator Fiscal service needs more lawyers and support staff and a stronger training infrastructure. The solution to the problem of crime in Scotland does not lie in more prisons and more mandatory sentences: these proposals have been rejected by the judiciary and by most commentators and it is an indictment of government in the last decade that our prison population is at its highest ever level - and still rising. What is needed is a range of alternatives to prison and a flexible sentencing policy coupled with schemes for education and rehabilitation that actually work. To implement and operate  such schemes the justice system must be encouraged to learn from international best practice and the SNP proposes the establishment of a research and development facility within a Scottish University to develop and implement education and rehabilitation schemes. The basis of community action against crime must lie in the community, and the SNP opposes the establishment of an all Scottish police force, although we endorse the move towards sharing of skills between forces and the establishment of national strategic initiatives where appropriate. Scotland should never lose sight of the link between poverty, social deprivation and crime. Accordingly, whilst crime must be tackled at source, the creation of a better and fairer society will also have a strong impact on crime levels. An economy that produces more jobs and more meaningful work for the people of Scotland will pay dividends in this area as well. Drugs and Crime A major cause of criminal activity lies in the drugs culture that has developed in parts of Scotland. But drug abuse, like crime, is also a symptom of something wrong in our society, that needs to be put right. Yet there is not one drugs problem, but many. And a variety of tactics are required to deal with them. What needs to be put right first is the question of demand. If demand for drugs in society is curtailed, then the drug problem will diminish. Tackling demand can vary from better resourced customs and police to more effective rehabilitation programmes in prisons and to drug education in schools. All such measures are supported by the SNP which has been active in the all party campaign Scotland against Drugs. Solving Scotlands drug problems also requires the collection of much information about drug use including much better recording of criminal statistics on drug related offences. THE SNP MANIFESTO 1997 6: Living in a Better Scotland The SNP also supports, and will encourage, local initiatives including Drugs Action Teams. Eradicating the Gun Culture The whole world was shocked by the Dunblane tragedy; but Scotlands call for action to ban all hand guns and to tighten restrictions on all other weapons was ignored by the Tory government. The SNP will introduce a total ban on handguns , making Scotland a safer place and taking a major step towards eradicating the gun culture which is creeping into our country. This measure will be accompanied by appropriate compensation for those deprived of their pastime and the SNP will enforce the Cullen recommendations in all other areas of firearms control. As a nation we must do our utmost to ensure that every step is taken to prevent another Dunblane. These measures, and the more stringent screening of firearm applications along with the establishment of a national register of firearms holders, will be a significant step towards that aim. Justice and Equality Spokesperson In the fight against crime, the SNP will encourage the extension of zero tolerance initiatives throughout Scotland, and will properly resource our over-stretched courts system. A ban on all handguns is supported by the vast majority of Scottish people and politicians, but has been frustrated by the Westminster system. An independent Parliament will deliver.  THE SNP MANIFESTO 1997 7: Serving a Better Scotland Just as crime, social justice and health are priorities for Scotland, so are Education, Housing, Local services and arts and leisure provision. These community services, usually delivered at local level, need to be enhanced and improved if the quality of life in Scotland is to be enhanced and improved. RESTORING EDUCATIONAL EXCELLENCE Labours so-called Passion for Education is a sham when the actual resources that are being offered  are examined closely. In contrast the SNP has firmly costed changes that can be made immediately to the Scottish Education system. Scotlands crisis in Education is the result of under funding; attempts to pin the blame on poor teaching, on the curriculum or on any other factors fail to take account of the constant erosion of morale and physical resources that has taken place in the last 18 years. An SNP Government will provide the extra resources to immediately employ an additional 700 teachers, and devote new resources to the repair and upgrading of school buildings. Both these actions are priorities, in order that class sizes can be reduced and classes taught in acceptable surroundings. Local Authorities, as the Education providers, need resourced adequately to undertake their tasks: the SNP in offering additional resources to local authorities across a wide range of fields will ensure that the local authorities also prioritise education and are sensitive to local need; there is no demand for opting out in Scotland and consequently the opting out legislation will be repealed. However schools will be assisted to control more of their budgets themselves and to involve the school board in financial decision making. Primary and Secondary schools will be enabled to take advantage of new technology and there will be guaranteed access to the Internet from each school as well as a programme to introduce computers into every classroom with the ultimate aim of all children using a computer terminal every day. Education is not just about schools: an SNP Government will introduce an entitlement to free nursery education for all 3 and 4 year olds whose parents wish it, and will make certain that such provision is properly funded. The voucher system will be abolished. At the other end of the educational spectrum an SNP Government will support the Higher Education sector, first of all by replacing the Student Loans system with a return to maintenance grants at the 1990 equivalent, index linked for successive years. Higher Education will have access to the Economic Development and Research Funds earmarked by an SNP Government as well as to the advice and assistance of the Exports Unit. We support the establishment of a Scottish Education and Training Export Group to co-ordinate the overseas marketing of Scottish expertise in this area. For those who do not go on to Higher Education an SNP Government will improve training and skills development and introduce a Integrated Training and Employment Grant Scheme , providing subsidies to employers taking on new employees in need of training, preferably the unemployed. Training schemes of this nature should not merely rotate the unemployed into temporary positions. We will add £50 million per year to the present youth and adult training budgets presently managed by Scottish Enterprise guaranteeing additional adult and youth training places. THE SNP MANIFESTO 1997 7: Serving a Better Scotland In keeping with the multi cultural society in which we live education in an independent Scotland will involve learning about the wide range of factors that have created our present society and will look outwards to our European and world partners. Gaelic and Scots have a place to play in this process and will be enhanced by such an approach. Gaelic medium education is of particular importance to many parents, and an SNP Government will require local authorities to ring fence dedicated funds for Gaelic medium education, as is presently done in Wales for Welsh language education. The SNP is also sensitive to the needs of other communities which are part of the rich tapestry of Scotland. Schools with pupils from Moslem families must offer Islamic studies to such pupils as a matter of course, and the same applies to other communities which wish to take part in Scottish education, but which also wish to retain and develop their distinctive nature. Scottish education will be enriched by such provision. These policies are all necessary parts of the process of improvement that Scotland needs. There are three final parts which require to be considered: housing, local services and arts and leisure provision. TACKLING THE HOUSING CRISIS For many years there has been a deplorable lack of investment in Scotlands housing. The result is a housing crisis with increased levels of homelessness and longer and longer council waiting lists. The Scottish Housing Conditions Survey has shown that too many of our citizens are forced to live in housing that is damp, overcrowded, poorly insulated and often lacking basic amenities. 90,000 Scottish homes are deemed to be below tolerable standard and one third are affected by damp, condensation or mould. An SNP Government will address this atrocious state of affairs by: Transferring Capital Debt: 75 percent of local authority housing debt will be transferred to Central Government in the first four years of an independent government, with the remainder being transferred in the following four years. From a public expenditure commitment of £985 million this will release over £1.6 billion for investment over four years to tackle housing problems and housing need as well as other social priorities. This one action should make a substantial start to solving Scotlands housing crisis. Eliminating Homelessness: Between 1978 and 1994 445,283 households applied to local authorities as homeless. This is a national disgrace and needs to be attended to as a matter of urgency. So does the situation in which, as Shelter estimate, there are up to 1000 rough sleepers in Scotland on any one night. An SNP Government will strengthen the existing Code of Guidance on Homelessness and ensure that in meeting the demands of the Code no one is left without a home in time of need. Build Homes and Raise Standards With the money released by the capital debt transfer up to 20,000 socially affordable homes can be built in the first four years, and a further 35,000 homes can be brought back from below tolerable standard. 160,000 homes can be treated for dampness and condensation. By applying higher standards of insulation money spent on upgrading can quickly be recouped in terms of energy expenditure. Education Spokesperson Scotland has the oldest education system in the world, and we need to reequip it for the challenges of the twenty-first century. We need to build on our strengths in Scotland - not make the mistakes that have afflicted education south of the Border. The SNP will invest in more teachers, and invest to repair crumbling school buildings.  THE SNP MANIFESTO 1997 7: Serving a Better Scotland SNP Vice President Scotland is experience a renaissance in the arts, which the SNP will build on. We will introduce incentives to encourage the developing film industry in Scotland, and reform broadcasting to encourage both diversity and greater opportunities for Scottish-based programme makers. The UK National Lottery will be replaced by a Scot-Lot. Reform Housing Tenure and the Right to Buy Some 300,000 houses have been bought under the Tory right to buy legislation, usually at a discounted price. This has left a disproportionate number of council houses in poor condition as the best of the stock has been purchased. It would be illogical to increase investment in socially affordable housing if it was then simply to be sold at a discount. New or improved houses coming on stream from the building and renovation programme will be protected from the right to buy at a discounted price. Those with existing tenancy agreements will however retain the right within the homes they presently occupy. A right to buy at full market value will continue for all tenants. An SNP Government will replace Scottish Homes with a new accountable housing agency whose remit will be to deal with Scotlands housing problems, improve Scotlands housing stock and provide affordable housing. Housing Associations and other bodies have a valuable role to play in these objectives and must be involved in policy formulation and in delivery. The SNP is the only party which has costed a full programme of action to tackle Scotlands housing crisis. Such a programme will not only begin to eliminate homelessness, it will also create many new jobs and provide a boost for the Scottish economy. It will reduce housing waiting lists and move Scotland towards the provision of a home for all. Making Local Government work Those living in a better Scotland have a right to expect better local services. An SNP Government, having protected the autonomy of Local Government in a written Constitution, will expect local authorities to ensure that local services are efficient, effective and well targeted. As Scottish local authorities will be elected by proportional representation, the monolithic and unresponsive one party states that Labour has created in many parts of Scotland will be consigned to the past. Local Government will have restored to it many of the powers lost to unelected quangos and there will be a review of the strategy and organisation of local economic development, with the aim or restoring local democratic control. Local Government finance will be reformed during the first term of an independent Scottish government and the introduction of local income tax in a subsequent term will remove the anomalies that presently bedevil local funding. Further adjustments to the support mechanisms for rural and island authorities would even out the support of local government by central government. An SNP Government would abolish the Water Quangos and return water and sewerage to democratic control. The arts and leisure Finally, arts and leisure provision are vital to the well being of society. An SNP Government will encourage a programme of sport for all and will back that policy up by the provision of affordable community sports facilities managed by local authorities. There will be ministerial responsibility for sports development and in addition to community participation it will be a policy aim to encourage international competitiveness and success. Scotlands cultural life is of enormous importance and must be underpinned by an effective Scottish broadcasting system and a raft of public support that opens THE SNP MANIFESTO 1997 7: Serving a Better Scotland access to all. An SNP Government will reform Scottish Broadcasting , building on the tradition of excellence that exists but ensuring that Scottish programme making and Scottish concerns are at the heart of an internationally forward looking service. We will retain a licence fee to support a public sector broadcaster (the Scottish Broadcasting Corporation ) but would encourage a diversity of commercial broadcasting on television and radio including at least one Scottish digital multiplex for a commercial service in the short term. Recognising that the age of effective protectionist broadcasting regulation is over, we would seek to ensure that the diversity of broadcasting channels observe the legal requirements of taste and decency while offering a wide range of services, and opportunities for Scottish based programme makers. Such services must include provision in Gaelic and Scots, but such provision must be accessible to wider audiences also. The SNP wishes to see a strong Scottish media production industry, which also means a strong Scottish film production sector. The introduction of tax incentives for production along the Irish model has been closely examined by the SNP in recent years, as has experience from elsewhere. An SNP government will introduce incentives for production and, through a new Scottish Screen (formed as a federation of film supporting, marketing and production orientated bodies ) will lay the basis for a renaissance in script and project development, commercial and non commercial production, marketing, distribution, exhibition and export of film. The work of the Scottish Arts Council requires adequate Government support but we wish to see the refocussing of the priorities of the Arts Council to support people and traditional arts as well as long established institutions. A Scottish Academy will be established, encouraging excellence and bringing forward new talent in the arts. Gaelic and Scots must be given equal status with English, both legally and in broadcasting and the arts. A Scottish Lottery would be established ( under the title Scot-Lot) with a more accountable system of distributing funds. The jackpot payouts would be smaller but the chances of winning would be considerably higher. Scratch cards would be banned, given the problems of addiction and social disruption they cause. Scot-Lot resources would be available for a wide range of projects, but would not replace government funding for social services. They could be used for health research in addition to sports, charitable and arts purposes. These many changes to Scottish life would make life in an independent Scotland a better experience for many of our fellow citizens. The fact that all these proposals have been costed and can be afforded by an independent Scotland should indicate to all Scottish voters that our constitutional choice is clear and can be made in confidence. Housing and Local Government Spokesperson With Independence, the SNP will entrench the rights of local government in a written Constitution bringing about a genuine partnership between local and central government. The water quangos will be abolished, and water services returned to local democratic control. Extra resources will be generated for housing by transferring councils housing capital debt to central government.  THE SNP MANIFESTO 1997 8: Helping all of Scotland A better Scotland in which all our citizens can live and work is the ambition and the intention of the Scottish National Party. But the benefits of such a Scotland have to reach to every part of our country and in so doing any political party has to address other issues and concerns that arise - issues of traditional industries, special local concerns, the environment and the needs of Scotlands island and rural communities. Scotlands land Land is the most valuable resource of a nation: but Scotlands system of land ownership and tenure is amongst the most archaic in the western world. The SNP has accepted the proposals of the Independent Land Commission to abolish feudal tenure. The system of feudal overlords has been widely abused and has led to depopulation, massive profits for individuals who care nothing for the land and the people and insecurity for those who thought they had a title to their homes. It has no place in a modern country, and during the period of its abolition we will consult widely, at home and abroad, to create a modern and fair system of land holding that matches the best to be found anywhere. We will establish a standing Scottish Land Commission to oversee the abolition of the old and the introduction of the new. Its membership will be representative of, and nominated by, local communities, land use interests, Members of the Scottish Parliament and Local Government representatives. There are also interim and urgent measures that can be taken to outlaw abuse of the feudal system prior to a complete change in the law. One such measure requires only the amendment of two century old Acts of Parliament to prevent ownership of local authority education buildings reverting to those who have speculatively purchased feudal superiorities. We will  also transfer the powers of the Crown Estate Commissioners and other private owners of the sea shore and inshore seabed to local councils and local councils will be empowered to promote balanced land use and local access. We will also establish an all Scotland Land Register which will give open access to all enquirers and banish forever the mystery of land ownership behind which many have hidden in recent years, to the detriment of local communities. Healing and building Scotlands Agriculture Scotlands farmers have been hard hit in recent years by successive Tory failures and by a growing neglect of the importance of the agricultural sector. Scotland, as a sparsely populated country, needs a strong agricultural base and that base can contribute greatly to Scottish exports and to the international reputation of our nation. The agricultural sector already contributes 3% of GDP. The Scottish farming community will be best represented by a seat at the top table in Europe for the country in which they live and by an independent Scottish government: our farmers and farming communities are presently of minor concern to any UK government, as the BSE crisis has shown. The SNP promoted a Scottish solution to the EU ban from day one, but the British government has refused to countenance such relief for Scottish beef farmers and the Scottish beef industry, even when invited to by the European Union. A tracability scheme can be introduced into the Scottish herd within a matter of months , giving Scottish beef producers the platform they need for re-entry. THE SNP MANIFESTO 1997 8: Helping all of Scotland Ending the ban is the first priority; then we must work to restore our reputation in Europe. No independent Scottish government would ever have allowed BSE to gain such a foothold and our regulatory and animal health regime must become the best in the world again. The Independent Scottish Food Agency will be a partner of the agricultural sector in restoring the domestic and international trade and will also work with producers to instil and enforce the best practices in the world. Agricultural policy is not, of course, based only on what has gone wrong in the past: Scottish agriculture has tremendous strengths, rooted in the skills and experience of those who passionately care for the land and for the future of their businesses. We need to develop a sustainable agricultural sector in Scotland. We need to reform the Common Agricultural Policy to ensure that support goes to those working the land as opposed simply to products and sectors. We need to develop new techniques, innovate in husbandry and production and widen the access to modern machinery, by supporting machinery rings. We must also promote sensitive rural diversification ( which will be paid for out of a rural development fund amounting to some £10 million per year) and sectors of the industry such as horticulture so that, with fair competition within the EU, we can widen the scope of Scottish agriculture and broaden the financial rewards. A priority will be to assist Scottish producers to have more and better access to the wholesale market and to retail outlets. The SNPs commitment to Scottish agriculture is firm and clear. Scottish farmers, producers and all those who work in ancillary industries, can only have their priorities met by an independent Scottish government which places their concerns firmly on the European and domestic agendas. Scotlands Forests Forestry is also a considerable national resource, and one which can be better used for the benefit of all. The SNP will promote the development of a sustainable Forest Industry in Scotland by establishing a National Forest Enterprise Board (replacing the Forestry Commission) to undertake the commercial management and development of Scotlands national forests in accordance with the land use strategy agreed by the Scottish Land Commission. The key priority will be to double forest and woodland cover within 25 years, with a particular emphasis on native woodland. This will not only have economic benefits but will also assist the environment by increasing the absorption of carbon dioxide. In parallel with this development, the NFEB will work with the private sector to stimulate wood using industries , which deepened upon sustainable production from native tree species. Private forest ownership can be of great benefit but tax incentives for such ownership must be targeted towards those who intend to build forestry and the forest industries, not just shelter their money for a while. The SNP is also committed to greater recreational use of forests, and the Land Commission, in enabling better public land access, will be mindful of the need to secure sensible forest access as well. Crofting Rural Affairs Spokesperson The BSE crisis shows that Scottish agriculture suffers from not having a direct voice in Europe, and Independence will end this dismal and damaging state of affairs. A Scottish government will also make better use of our native forestry resources, and support crofting. Scotlands system of land ownership and tenure is among the most archaic in the Western world, and abolishing the feudal system will be a priority.  THE SNP MANIFESTO 1997 8: Helping all of Scotland Environment Spokesperson The SNPs concern is to ensure a positive relationship between faster growth and sustainable development, and all policies will be subject to an environmental impact assessment. The SNP will support research and development initiatives in the field of clean technology and engineering, renewable energy, and general waste reprocessing and management. Crofter and tenant farmers have a role to play in forest development, treating (where holdings allow) timber as a common crop. But this will be suitable for a small minority of crofters only. The SNP wishes to see the Crofters Commission transformed into a National Crofting Development Agency with the power to assist crofting in the Highlands and Islands and small land tenure elsewhere. The great strength of crofting is its ability to keep populations on the land and to prevent consequent depopulation of vital areas. Crofting is a way of life, but rarely a principal occupation. Accordingly assisting crofters to purchase crofting estates should be done as part of an overall development scheme for those areas, where new employment can be provided in new enterprises as well as enhanced crofting opportunities. The crofting estates that currently belong to the Crown should be returned to the people who live on them, but the opportunity to develop vibrant communities on crofting estates should not apply only to those who, by accident of tenure, are tenants of the Crown. Private ownership should also be subject to regulation for purchase under clear conditions. Scotlands Fishing Industry All the evidence in the history of the Common Fisheries Policy points to the harsh reality that the UK has been happy , more often than not, to trade off fishing interests for other goals in European policy. Scottish fishermen have paid the price for that UK hypocrisy. An SNP Government would use its improved influence as a full Member State in negotiations for a new European fisheries policy to ensure that the founding principles of the original CFP , in particular relative stability, are permanent components of future fisheries agreements . The processing sector, which provides vital employment and has good opportunities for expansion, must be supported particularly in an environment where rival sectors, for example on the Humber, are being allocated significant public resources. The Scottish Exports Unit will be of particular help to this sector. The fundamental objective of the SNP fisheries policy is to create a well managed and properly conserved fishery. The SNP proposes six fundamental reforms which would assist the Scottish fishing industry: A new framework whereby coastal states with the greatest historic interests in specific fisheries would be able to take the key control and management decisions relating to the fisheries in the waters off their coasts in Regional Fisheries Management Councils. New measures for the processing sector seeking to promote continuity, security and stability of supplies , backed by assistance towards infrastructure costs, training packages and maximising the potential to add value to fisheries products. A rigorous but fair policing regime enforceable equally in all EU waters. Greater emphasis on technical measures to conserve fish stocks. Improvements in the efficiency and effectiveness of research. * Priority to areas with a high degree of fishing dependence , population sparsity and peripherality to be built in to fisheries policy. THE SNP MANIFESTO 1997 8: Helping all of Scotland The SNP has allocated an additional £10 million per annum within the Independence Budget to achieve the following strategic objectives: Levering the maximum benefit of EU financial assistance to coastal regions by committing an extra £5 million from government resources to structural support and socio-economic measures. Promoting fisheries products and marketing initiatives, stressing the health value of fish with an additional £800,000 spend co-ordinated by a new processing task force. An additional £1.6 million for harbour and infrastructure improvements which will leverage additional European funds. Improving the effectiveness of research. The Environment Scotlands international reputation is as a clean nation, rich in land and water. But in reality Scotland is now threatened by a number of environmental hazards. We must ensure that Scotlands environment is restored and our people given back a confidence in their surroundings. We must also put in place the best environmental standards, so that we cease to heedlessly waste resources, and instead contribute to the betterment of our planet and those with whom we share it. The SNP will retain the Scottish Environmental Protection Agency and will ensure that it is independent of the Executive and responsible to the Scottish Parliament. Its expanded task will be to Establish stricter controls on pollution of the atmosphere, sea , inland waters and land. Control, develop and promote the means of environmental rehabilitation Establish codes of practice for industry Ensure that there is full public consultation on, and enquiry into, the environmental impact of major projects and government policies. An SNP Government will also promote recycling, and contribute to global environmental protection. As part of the overall strategy of government an SNP Government will establish and enshrine National Environmental Targets. An opportunity for Dounreay It goes without saying that no SNP Government would permit Nuclear Reprocessing to take place in Scotland. Nuclear reprocessing at Dounreay would end immediately an SNP Government was elected and arrangements would be made for all nuclear material originating furth of Scotland to be returned to their country of origin. Materials originating in Scotland will require to be stored in Scotland for as long as environmentally required. However, rather than this determination being seen as a threat to the people of Dounreay, it should be seen as a major opportunity. Employment in clean up, storage and decommissioning will be a long term prospect for many people; many others will be employed in a new renewable energy research and development centre which will be established at Dounreay. An energy rich nation The vital resource of the 20th century has been energy. And in the 21st century energy self sufficiency, still more the ability to export energy or energy sources, will remain of great importance to any nation. Transport and Telecommunications Spokesperson Scotland needs an integrated transport network which will give good access to all parts of the country, speed the delivery of goods and services, and bring the nation closer together. Priorities for the SNP are bringing Railtrack back into public ownership, ending the Skye Bridge tolls, and abolishing the Airport Tax in the Highlands & Islands.  THE SNP MANIFESTO 1997 8: Helping all of Scotland Marine Resources Spokesperson Marine resources have long been one of Scotlands key assets, and provide the lifeblood for many communities. Support will be provided for the regeneration of the fishing fleet. The promotion of Scottish fisheries products will be enhanced, and resources provided for harbour and infrastructure modernisation.  Scotland is an energy rich nation. That fact alone should give us the confidence to face the future in the normal state of independence. But , as part of the bankrupt and out of date Union, we do not use our energy wealth wisely. In fact our wealth is being squandered by Westminster. An Independent Scotland will secure a division of North Sea oil assets based upon the latitude of 55o 50 north or the international legal principle of equidistance. The Continental Shelf (Jurisdictional) Order already provides such a division, and this order dating from 1968 presently places operations in either an English sector (governed by English Law) or a Scottish sector (governed by Scottish Law). This division has been operated by successive Labour and Tory Governments and places 90% north sea output under Scottish control , a percentage that is growing as the exploitable reserves move north. All existing obligations to oil and gas operators will be honoured, and the SNP envisages no substantive change in the taxation regime so that there can be a clear, stable and continuing climate for the oil industry. The policy of an SNP government will be to secure a sustainable and long term oil industry: even present estimates indicate that there is as much oil still to be extracted as has already been extracted, and an SNP government will encourage exploration to increase known reserves and to increase recoverability from existing fields. An SNP Government will seek to add value to Scotlands energy resources , for example by ending the discriminatory pricing policies which mean that landing charges from Scottish gas fields can be anything up to 17 times those south of the border, a situation which has led to gas from the North Sea by-passing Scotland: the Great Gas Robbery. Failure to achieve a satisfactory resolution of this problem will result in an SNP government examining ways in which the gas network, instead of being owned by a single private company could be jointly owned by all companies with an interest in Scottish gas production and supply, with a guiding golden share held for the public good. In addition, development of petro-chemical activity that can build on Scottish land fall of Scottish resources will be encouraged. Whilst the Scottish coal industry has been decimated in recent years, coal still has a part to play in a balanced energy policy. Whilst the SNP wishes to see tighter controls on open cast mining, and a clearer environmental evaluation of each proposed project, deep mining also needs to be re-examined with a view to accessing rich seams that have been abandoned too early and without reference to modern technology. The SNP is resolutely opposed to Nuclear Power Generation: at present we have neither the ability to make it totally safe, nor the knowledge to be completely certain about long term effects, and long term problems. An SNP government will introduce a programme to phase out nuclear generation in Scotland. The length of this phased programme will be planned to take account of new energy sources coming on stream, and on the safe methods of removing nuclear generation from our energy mix. There are a number of sources of power in Scotland that are cheaper as well as more environmentally acceptable than Nuclear power and others are developing. THE SNP MANIFESTO 1997 8: Helping all of Scotland To replace nuclear generation, Scotland requires to develop alternative energy sources that are renewable and sustainable. The SNP Budget contains an allocation of funding for this task, and also funding for schemes of energy conservation, which can reduce our demand significantly by reducing heating bills. Scotland on the move Scotland needs an integrated transport network, that gives good access to all parts of the country, speeds goods and services, and brings the nation closer together. There remains a need for some improvements to the road network, but we must also be mindful of the need to reduce overall car and lorry usage in the years ahead, particularly in our towns and cities. The solution to reduced car usage in particular lies in better public transport, and the SNP will invest in rail services , first of all by returning the Scottish assets of Railtrack into public ownership and then by modernising and electrifying the East Coast Line , commuter routes and branch lines. Bus and Coach services are also vital and must be integrated with rail services. Effective Bus and Coach transport can assist greatly in easing road congestion and regulation of bus operators should recognise the need to guide service development and delivery to achieve that end as well as to ensure the maintenance of vital links. The SNP regards the tolls presently levied by the Skye Bridge as an unacceptable imposition on the people of Skye and as a great disincentive to the creation and preservation of employment. The SNP will , in the immediate term, replace the present tolls with shadow tolls and will take the bridge into public ownership within the first four years of an SNP government. The SNP will also move towards the removal of all tolls on Scottish bridges, and will not introduce tolls on any new or existing bridges or roads. Ferries are vital to Scotlands communications infrastructure and the national Ferry company, Caledonian MacBrayne will be resourced to operate effective , economical services within Scottish waters and will be allowed to compete for services from Scotland, including services from a new East of Scotland ferry port. The SNP will abolish the Air Passenger Duty for the Highlands and Islands , as it unfairly discriminates against Scotlands most remote communities and will modify it for other areas to reflect the cost of the fare rather than imposing a flat rate which works against much needed low cost air transport. In keeping with the need to encourage enterprise and development, we will remove unreasonable restrictions on international freight (the so called fifth freedom) and bearing in mind Scotlands crucial geographical place for Air Traffic Control we will co-operate with our European partners on developing a pan national approach to air space regulation, whilst developing and modernising our Oceanic Air Traffic Control centre. Scotland needs more direct air links with the world, and we will work with private operators to make these sustainable, as well as assisting Scottish airports to provide high quality services easily accessible to passengers. Developing the Telecommunications Network A final area of opportunity for all of Scotland is the challenge of the global Telecommunications can not only connect parts of Scotland that would otherwise be remote, but it can and will also open Scotland up to the world, and the world to Scotland. Energy Spokesperson Scotland is one of the most energy rich nations in Europe, and yet many of our people suffer from fuel poverty. With Independence, we will develop our sustainable energy sources, and phase out nuclear power. VAT on fuel will be cut from 8 to 5 per cent.  THE SNP MANIFESTO 1997 8: Helping all of Scotland An SNP Government will strengthen regulation of monopoly suppliers in the Telecommunications Market whilst facilitating greater competition and embracing the drive towards common European and world standards. The SNP will support communications developments in rural areas, particularly in the Highlands and Islands, and assist the University of the Highlands and Islands in establishing a world lead in distance learning by the Internet and other means. Telecrofting and Telecommuting have a much to offer a country like Scotland and an SNP Government will explore tax incentives for individuals and businesses taking this route. Such patterns of working reduce demand on city transport and facilities and should be encouraged. However, whatever policies an SNP Government follows it will not impact upon use of the Internet and global communications unless it also takes a strongly pro-active stance in encouraging domestic, educational and business access to , and use of, the information super highway. The 21st century will be the century of information - information as a resource and as an empowering tool. Scots have spent too long following trends, rather than setting them, and an SNP Government will set as a policy objective the commercial support of the Internet so that Scottish companies can access, present themselves through, and provide service on the net and so that individuals and schools can integrate the worlds knowledge base in their own experience, and contribute to it. The rate of involvement in, and access to, the Internet should be regulated by commerce and competition, but the Government has a role in supporting Scottish endeavours in this field, and enabling educational use. Scotland as a technology manufacturing base can gain a great deal by seeking always to be part of the cutting edge of technology, and this attitude to the Internet, allied with the encouragement of software manufacture and hardware assembly as core Scottish industries, will be assessed at regular intervals so that Government strategy can lead Scotlands modern potential instead of dragging it down as is the case now. In keeping with an open and positive philosophy on net use and access, no new regulations on censorship or control will be introduced, but support will be given to a ratings system to prevent unwitting access . However Scots Law will require to develop means of combating computer fraud and existing law needs to be examined to see if its scope can deal with abuse of individuals by computer means. THE SNP MANIFESTO 1997 9: Scotland in Europe and the World Professor Christopher Harvie once called Scotland The invisible nation of Europe. It is time for Scotland to become visible again and to resume a place in the world. The European Union An SNP Government would wish to make certain that Scotlands traditional openness to Europe and the World again coloured all our international relations. With a secure independent Parliament at home, the benefits of international cooperation and full and equal membership of international organisations would greatly strengthen Scotlands ability to defend and promote its interests in a world that shrinks each day. Scotland will be a full member of the European Union, participating fully in the institutions of the Union. As a small independent country Scotland can have considerable influence in a Europe which is increasingly dominated by small member states. We will have full voting power in the European Council and the Council of Ministers. These representatives would be in a position to advocate on Scotlands behalf with the right of veto over any decisions affecting Scotlands vital national interests. This is a far cry from the present powerlessness we endure, and some considerable distance from the still powerless observer status that Labour proposes under its devolution plans. An SNP Government will use our influence and voting power to gain the maximum benefits for Scottish industry and the Scottish people. Our priority would be to enter into the negotiations on the new Common Fisheries Policy to get a better deal for Scotlands fishing industry and to re-orientate the Common Agricultural Policy towards those who work the land. We will ensure that rural and urban areas of Scotland receive maximum help from the appropriate EU funds. Scotlands representation in the European Parliament would double on Independence and the SNP will support the introduction of a Europe wide voting system for this Parliament to strengthen democracy. In the interim we will introduce a proportional system for the first elections after independence. We support extending the Parliaments powers to include the proper scrutiny of the Council and the Commission. An Independent Scottish Parliament will elect Scotlands Commissioner and of course Scotland would take its turn at the European Presidency, bringing substantial benefits to the nation. Diplomatic Links Scotland will require a cost effective , efficient and modern diplomatic presence in some of the worlds capitals. Most small nations do not attempt to emulate the imperial pretensions of the United Kingdom, but instead target their diplomatic effort where it will do most good. Scotlands embassies and consulates will exist to promote Scottish trade and industry, look after Scottish citizens and represent the best of Scotland to the world. We already pay our share of the UK diplomatic budget, but receive little in return. An Independent Scotland would get a much better return for this necessary expenditure. Dr AllanDr Allan Dr AllanMacartney MEPMacartney MEPMacartney MEP Macartney MEPMacartney MEPEurope and External Affairs Spokesperson Scotland needs a direct voice in the European Union, so that we can protect and promote our national interests at the top table where the real decisions are taken - instead of being left on the sidelines. In the wider world, we have a responsibility to meet the UNs guideline of 0. 7 per cent of GDP devoted to overseas aid, and the SNP will honour this.  THE SNP MANIFESTO 1997 9: Scotland in Europe and the World International Institutions Independence means joining in, not staying separate. The real separatists are those who have put us in our present condition, for they do not allow us to take a full part in anything. Scotland will be a full member of the Commonwealth and will use its membership both to promote international co-operation and to market its expertise, particularly in the educational field where Scottish Universities and Colleges already have a good reputation. Scotland will be a member of the Council of Europe which unites almost all nations on the continent. The Council is best known for its offshoot, the European Court of Human Rights, and an independent Scotland will fully support the Council and the Court and seek to assist in making its judgements and deliberations effective. Scotland will be a member of the United Nations. The Scottish UN Mission would be one of the two most important Scottish diplomatic postings (the other being the Scottish Permanent Representative to the EU) and Scotland in membership of the UN will support peacekeeping, the development of aid, cultural and educational programmes and - unlike many members - pay its dues while working for necessary reforms. Finally Scotland will seek to assist in the establishment of an Association of States of the British Isles which will include England, Wales and Ireland. This grouping will work together on problems and possibilities that exist in our area and which can be helped by joint action. Defending Scotland No part of the UK has played such a central role in the defence of the realm as Scotland. Its military and naval traditions are well known, and the professionalism of its service men and women will be an enormous asset to an independent state. At the date of independence all serving service personnel from Scotland will be given the opportunity to transfer to the Scottish Defence Forces. The same guarantee will apply to all MOD personnel serving in Scotland. Conscription is neither necessary, desirable nor anticipated. Indeed, as modern defence rejects conscription and as it is more costly in many ways, conscription would be a backward looking cul de sac. Because of Scotlands geographic position, vital assets and international perspective, a modern, efficient and appropriate defence structure can be established that will be professional, well resourced and well targeted to its tasks. The Scottish Army will require infantry battalions, a commando battalion, an armoured regiment, and the requisite combat support and combat supply service units. Stationed at existing barracks the Army will require 9000 regulars, 16000 regular reservists, 7000 national reserves and 2000 MOD civilians. Traditional Scottish regiments will be restored wherever possible. The Scottish Navy will require both surface and submarine craft based at Faslane and Rosyth with a berthing base at Lerwick. It will have 5000 regulars, 2000 regular reserves and 600 national reserves as well as 5000 MoD personnel. The Scottish Air Force will have both fixed wing and helicopter capability. THE SNP MANIFESTO 1997 9: Scotland in Europe and the World The main bases will be Leuchars, Kinloss, and Lossiemouth. There will be 6000 regulars , 3650 regular reservists, 400 national reserves and 2850 MoD civilians. The Scottish Defence Forces will prioritise joint services training, and support and command structures will be developed to avoid needless and costly duplication of effort. A culture of inter service co-operation will be central to the Forces philosophy. The traditions of Scottish units, built up over many years, will be fostered and maintained in the Defence Forces. An Independent Scotland will contribute to, and benefit from, international co-operation especially in peace keeping, training, and conflict resolution. In addition to the SNPs support for an EU Common Security and Defence Policy we would participate in the Western European Union, the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe, the North Atlantic Co-operation Council and the Partnership for Peace. A Peacekeeping college will be established in Scotland to instruct SDF and foreign personnel in the theory and practice of peace keeping and seek to place Scotland in the forefront of international peacekeeping efforts. The SNP have a long standing objection to nuclear weapons. We will negotiate a phased but complete withdrawal of Trident from the Clyde and invest our savings from this costly , deadly and unnecessary nuclear deterrent in conventional defence as well as in other priorities including health and education. An independent Scotland will inherit a treaty obligation to NATO. However our opposition to nuclear defence will make our continued participation in nuclear alliances difficult. We therefore propose to negotiate a phased withdrawal from NATO but will retain military co-operation with NATO nations as a result of our other proposed international involvements already mentioned above. Defence Industries in Scotland will be free to carry on their businesses in cooperation with firms outside Scotland. Their end user certifications will be subject to stringent scrutiny, but at the same time Scottish firms will have priority in tendering for SDF contracts within the constraints of EU legislation. Refit of the SDF navy will take place at Rosyth, and the rolling programme of equipment replacement should enhance the position of Scottish defence contractors who will, at last, have a national force to attend to without being totally dependent on the lottery of UK defence procurement procedures run from distant and often deaf Whitehall. The SNP will also promote Defence Diversification , with funding already allocated in the SNP Budget. The highly skilled Scottish defence manufacturing companies, and their workers, will have a brighter future both in supplying the SDF and in being encouraged and assisted to expand their abilities and markets. Scotland helping the world. It has been, and remains, a matter of shame that the UK, one of the richer nations of the world, is so miserly when it comes to international aid. The UK presently falls far short of the agreed international target of 0.7% of GDP to be spent on international aid. Indeed further recent cuts have taken the UKs GDP share to below 0.3%. The SNP has budgeted for a steady growth from this low point (which we shall inherit), with the aim of reaching 0.7% in six years. This period will allow the development of the necessary infrastructure, both governmental and voluntary, to meet the challenge of overseas aid and relief work. Defence Spokesperson An independent Scotland will benefit from strong conventional forces, and will have no place for expensive and useless Trident nuclear weapons. Like other small nations, we will participate in European defence structures, and invest in defence diversification.  THE SNP MANIFESTO 1997 9: Scotland in Europe and the World Small countries in Europe lead the way in aid, relief and international assistance. Sweden, Norway and Denmark are good examples of different models that work well. Scotland can be amongst them and with independence it will be. Kenny MacAskillKenny MacAskillKenny MacAskillKenny MacAskillKenny MacAskillSNP National Treasurer Only the SNP stand up for the mainstream Scottish values of enterprise and compassion - and that is reflected throughout this manifesto document. We are the only real Scottish party standing in this election. We dont take our orders from London. We put Scotland first - every time.  THE SNP MANIFESTO 1997 10: Paying for Scotlands Future This manifesto has laid out the main proposals of the SNP for the creation of an independent nation once again and the sensitive, compassionate and forward looking governance of that nation which the SNP believe can be delivered. But plans would be worthless without the resources to pay for them. And because the SNP aspire to govern Scotland, we also plan in detail for our country. That is why we publish with this manifesto a fully costed budget for the first four years of independence. That budget takes account of the riches of Scotland and of the extra resources we can generate by a new approach to business and individual taxation. It lays out those areas in which we can re-order spending , switching resources from needless projects like Trident, to needed projects like new schools and hospitals. Whilst the accompanying document explains the budget measures in detail, the chart opposite gives the basic financial information and answers the questions: Where is the money coming from? and Where is the money going? It also gives that strong affirmation that Alex Salmond used in his introduction. For it says YES WE CAN! 10: Paying for Scotlands Future THE SNP MANIFESTO 1997 Using your vote On the 1st of May you will have the opportunity of using your vote to choose Scotlands future. The SNP has laid out in this manifesto its plans and proposals, and - alone amongst the political parties - has clearly costed them . Also alone amongst the political parties, the Scottish National Party is offering a programme made for Scotland in Scotland: a programme that uses Scottish resources and Scottish principles to solve Scottish problems. Independence is the normal status for nations. More than half of the nations of the world are smaller than Scotland, and most are much poorer. Yet they have chosen independence, and not one would wish to give it up. We can do so too - together. We can answer the questions about our future with the confident statement YES WE CAN Yes We Can be free: Yes We Can be independent: Yes We Can pay our way in the world. And yes, we must!"
"Labour",200106,"Ambitions for Britain.  Labours manifesto 2001.  Fulfilling Britains great potential.  The Prime Minister sets out his vision for Britains future  Investment and reform  Key measures for public service reform:  1 PROSPERITY FOR ALL.  How we expand our economy and raise our living standards.  2 WORLD-CLASS PUBLIC SERVICES.  How investment and reform will improve public services.  3 A MODERN WELFARE STATE.  How we help people into work and provide security for those who cant work.  4 STRONG AND SAFE COMMUNITIES.  How we tackle crime and renew our society.  5 BRITAIN STRONG IN THE WORLD.  How we make foreign policy work for Britain and the wider world.  The choices for Britain.  A lot done, a lot to do, and a lot to lose.  25 steps to a better Britain.  Our key steps for a second term.  The contract delivered.  How Labour has fulfilled its first-term promises.  This general election is in many ways even more important than the last. Since May 1997 we have laid the foundations of a Britain whose economy is stronger, where investment is now pouring into public services, where social division is being slowly healed and where influence abroad is being regained. But these are only the foundations of larger change. Now is the chance to build the future properly, to make the second term the basis for a radical programme of British renewal: to keep a firm grip on inflation, with low interest rates and the public finances sound, and then build the dynamic and productive economy of the future; to keep investment coming into public services and then making the reforms so we use the money well; to refashion the welfare state on the basis of rights and responsibilities, with people helped to help themselves, not just given handouts; to ensure all families are safe in their communities by tackling crime and its causes; and to give Britain back its leadership role in the world. We need the second term to do all this. That is the choice: to make progress or to dismantle the foundations laid. And with the state of todays Conservatives, the choice is stark.  This choice will decide whether more people will be able to realise their aspirations for themselves and their children  to be able to rely on a stable economy where hard work is rewarded by rising living standards, to receive world-class education and healthcare, to enjoy a dignified old age, to feel safe and secure in a strong community, and to be proud to be British. Or whether we will be held back by the traditional British malaise of restricting lifes great opportunities and blessings to a minority.  There is much still to be done, but we have come a long way in four years. Britain stands more prosperous, more equal, more respected. Our country is on a new course.  My passion is to continue the modernisation of Britain in favour of hard-working families, so that all our children, wherever they live, whatever their background, have an equal chance to benefit from the opportunities our country has to offer and to share in its wealth.  THE CHALLENGE FOR BRITAIN.  I am honoured to be Prime Minister. And I have a confident belief in our country. We are not boastful. But we have real strengths. Great people. Strong values. A proud history.  The British people achieved magnificent things in the 20th century. But for too long, our strengths have been undermined by weaknesses of elitism and snobbery, vested interests and social division, complacency bred by harking back to the past. We achieved spurts of economic growth, but inflation would then get out of control. Our welfare state was founded to offer security, but its progress was stalled. We reached out to Europe, then drew back to become semi-detached.  It is as if a glass ceiling has stopped us fulfilling our potential. In the 21st century, we have the opportunity to break through that glass ceiling, because our historic strengths match the demands of the modern world.  We can use our openness and entrepreneurial flair to become a global centre in the knowledge economy. We can use our sense of fair play and mutual responsibility to be a strong, dynamic, multiracial society held together by strong values. We can use our historic and geographical position to link Europe and America, and help the developing world.  The key to tapping our strengths, to breaking through this glass ceiling, is contained in a simple but hard-to-achieve idea, set out at the heart of our partys constitution: the determination to put power, wealth and opportunity in the hands of the many, not the few.  I know as well as anyone that we have just begun; millions of hard-working families want, need and deserve more. That means more change in a second term, not less  to extend opportunity for all. We reject the quiet life. We must secure a mandate for change.  TEN GOALS FOR 2010:   Long-term economic stability.   Rising living standards for all.  Expanded higher education as we raise standards in secondary schools.   A healthier nation with fast treatment, free at the point of use.  Full employment in every region.   Opportunity for all children, security for all pensioners.   A modern criminal justice system.   Strong and accountable local government.   British ideas leading a reformed and enlarged Europe.   Global poverty and climate change tackled.  Fulfilling Britains great potential.  SHIFTING THE ODDS FOR HARD-WORKING FAMILIES.  In 1997 we promised a start, not a revolution. We made five specific five-year pledges. Three have been completed early; all will be completed within five years, as we promised. Each pledge is matched by further achievement: the lowest inflation and unemployment for a generation; one million new jobs; over 17,000 extra nurses, the best primary school test results ever and, as the British Crime Survey shows, crime is down by ten per cent. We also offered a ten-point contract to the British people. The results are at the back of this manifesto. Not everything has gone right  it never does. But we are getting there, easing burdens and extending opportunities, by choice not chance. Economic instability wrecks the lives of hard-working families. So we chose to put the public finances right. It meant tough decisions that were opposed by the Conservatives. But today the economy is stable and growing, and interest rates are nearly half the level they averaged under the Conservatives. Unemployment steals dignity. So we chose to introduce a windfall tax on the excess profits of the privatised utilities and to use the money to help unemployed people back to work. That was opposed by the Conservatives, who are now pledged to abolish the New Deal. But today, youth unemployment is at its lowest level since 1975 and longterm unemployment at its lowest level since 1978. Poor education is a cruel injustice. So we chose to introduce a new system for teaching the basics in primary schools. We met opposition, and the Conservatives want to roll back our programmes. But today, primary schools are achieving their best results ever. A run-down health service causes insecurity. So we chose to reform the NHS, and inject new money. Waiting lists and times are now down and falling, and the number of nurses and doctors is now rising. Poverty denies basic rights. So we chose to reform the welfare state to channel extra money to the poorest pensioners and poorest children. Today, single pensioners can look forward to a minimum income of £100 a week and pensioner couples £154, and over one million children have been taken out of poverty. The centralisation of power only helps the powerful. So we chose to break the suffocating centralisation of British government. The UK has been strengthened. Today, it is the Conservatives who threaten the stability of the UK with their proposals for two classes of MP. Our Scottish and Welsh manifestos, alongside this one, set out our vision for continued partnership. Isolation from Europe does not help anyone. So we chose to engage constructively in Europe, not to shout abuse from the sidelines. Today, Europe is moving in a direction that is good for Britain and good for Europe. In policy for aid, development and international debt relief, we have led the way. Of course, there are still big problems, but we are better off, better educated, better governed, better respected abroad. There has been another change too  a change of priorities and values. We learnt in the 1980s that looking after number one was not enough; that without opportunity, responsibility was weak; that an unfair society was a less prosperous one. The philosophy was wrong  it hurt millions of families and left our country with lasting problems. We have shown we are a reformed party, competent to govern. Now we offer more. More change, and more rewards for Britains hard-working families: more prosperity, more opportunities, more security.  AMBITIONS FOR BRITAIN.  Stretching the family budget, finding time for children as well as work, holding on to mutual respect, staying healthy when there can be danger even in the air we breathe. These are daily worries that people face. They are my concerns too. But, while there is always a market for people who say we are doomed, that all new ideas are bad ideas even as things improve, that we might as well curl up with our prejudices and shut the door on the world, I am an optimist. New Labour is ambitious for Britains future and is ready to lead. First, we will sustain economic stability and build deeper prosperity that reaches every region of the country. Skills, infrastructure, the technological revolution  all are vital to raise British living standards faster. We will put as much energy into helping the seven million adults without basic skills as we did when tackling long-term unemployment through the New Deal. Second, we seek to achieve a renaissance of status and quality for public services and their staff. We will build on our success in primary schools to overhaul secondary schools; we will invest new resources and empower doctors and nurses to transform health services; and we will seek to extend the very best in culture and sport to all. Third, we seek to modernise the welfare state. The benefits system will be restructured around work; support for children and families through the tax and benefits system will be transformed; cash and services for pensioners will be radically improved. Fourth, we will strengthen our communities. We will reform the criminal justice system at every level so that criminals are caught, punished and rehabilitated. And because we know that without tackling the causes of crime we will never tackle crime, we will empower local communities by combining resources with responsibility. Fifth, we will turn our inner confidence to strength abroad, in Europe and beyond, to tackle global problems  above all, environmental degradation and the shame of global poverty.  We will engage fully in Europe, help enlarge the European Union and make it more effective, and insist that the British people have the final say on any proposal to join the Euro. These ambitions are summarised in ten goals for 2010. They will never be achieved by government alone. We know it is people who ultimately change the country. Our partnership with the voluntary sector has steadily strengthened since 1997, as we learn from its diversity. We work with the private sector, drawing on its vitality. Countries only prosper on the basis of partnership  between government, employers and their employees, and the voluntary sector. What Britain needs is an active, enabling state, not a nanny state, doing things with people not to them. So, while the Conservatives will spend most of this election telling you what their government cannot do, this manifesto sets out what our government can do. We know the power and value of markets, but we also know their limits. Now is the time to renew our civic and social institutions to deliver improvements in education, health, safety, transport and the environment.  FIGHTING FOR VALUES, NOT JUST FOR ELECTION VICTORY.  The Conservatives always look back.  In economic policy they promise to repeat the mistakes of the 1980s  unaffordable tax cuts and spending cuts, followed by ballooning deficits, rising interest rates and the old cycle of boom and bust.  In social policy their renewed commitment to cuts and privatisation and to withdrawing the support helping to heal social division, is just a throwback to the 1980s.  In foreign policy they risk not just isolation but exit from the EU. Jobs, trade, investment depend on our membership of the European Union. The Conservative policy of opposing the enlargement of Europe in the Nice Treaty and their pledge to renegotiate the terms of Britains EU membership is dangerous and ill thought-out. Standing up for Britain means fighting for Britains interests in Europe, not leaving Europe  which threatens our national interest. So the choice Britain faces today is starker than in 1997.  The Conservatives have swung further to the right. And, in government, Labours agenda has become increasingly bold and ambitious.  For many years, the Conservatives claimed to offer economic strength while Labour dominated social issues.  Many people found their head telling them to vote Tory, and their heart telling them to vote Labour.  Today, head and heart are coming together. New Labour is proving that it is only by using the talents of all that we get a healthy economy, and that it is only by giving a stake to all that we are a healthy society.  We have made our choice: stability not boom and bust; investment not cuts; engagement not isolationism; the many, not the few.  A lot done and a lot more to do with new Labour  or a lot for you to lose under the Conservatives.  I deeply believe that, for Britain, the best is still to come.  So I ask you to continue on this journey with us. Together we can achieve so much more.  Prime Minister and Leader of the Labour Party  Better primary school results than ever before now we focus on secondary schools More jobs, more dignity, more wealth. Tony Blair with construction workers in North Tyneside.  New Labour believes that Britain needs investment in schools and hospitals, not reckless tax cuts  Before 1997 we promised and kept to two tough years on spending to get the public finances in shape. Now, consistent with meeting our fiscal rules, we promise substantial rises for key public services. To help deliver our plans, our ten-year goal is the renewal of local government.  We will now:  - increase education spending by more than five per cent in real terms each year for the next three years as we increase the share of national income for education in the next Parliament.  - increase health spending by an average of six per cent in real terms each year for the next three years.  - increase spending on our police  an extra £1.6 billion a year by 2003/04.  - increase spending on transport by 20 per cent for the next three years, on our way to a £180 billion investment of public and private money for transport over the next ten years.  - use a £400 million reward fund for local government in return for signing up to clear targets to improve local services.  New Labour believes in renewing a public service ethic by giving frontline staff new freedoms to respond to public needs. For public services to be renewed, we will need more staff, properly rewarded. It is these frontline staff, operating in new ways, who will drive up standards in our key public services. We will decentralise power to make that possible.  We will now deliver:  - 20,000 more nurses who will be given new enhanced roles and more power for matrons and ward sisters with control over budgets.  - 10,000 more doctors, and access to a £500 million Performance Fund to spend on new patient services.  - 10,000 more teachers. Invest in further rapid promotion and rewards for classroom excellence, more classroom assistants and help with housing costs in high-cost areas.  - 6,000 extra police recruits, raising police numbers to their highest ever level, with strong local leadership and proper rewards for those on the frontline.  INVESTMENT AND REFORM.  New Labour believes that a stable economy is the platform for rising living standards and opportunity for all  Our ten-year goals are for long-term economic stability and faster productivity growth than our main competitors.  We will now:  - deliver economic stability with mortgages as low as possible, low inflation and sound public finances.  - reform further education, and help 750,000 adults achieve basic skills expand the Childrens Tax Credit to offer up to £1,000 per year for parents of newborn children.  - create a new Child Trust Fund for every child at birth.  - increase the minimum wage to £4.20.  - not raise the basic or top rate of income tax and extend the 10p band.  - strengthen regional economies with venture capital funds and new powers for reformed Regional Development Agencies.  - develop the Small Business Service and cut red tape.  - give British people the final say in any referendum on the single currency.  Public services: investment and reform Renewal of our public services is at the centre of new Labours manifesto.  A single aim drives our policy programme: to liberate peoples potential, by spreading power, wealth and opportunity more widely, breaking down the barriers that hold people back.  But this is only possible on the continued foundation of economic stability: mortgages as low as possible, low inflation and sound public finances.  The manifesto is comprehensive. Here we set out some of the key measures for investment and reform that we believe give us a historic opportunity to modernise our schools, NHS, criminal justice system and welfare state.  New Labour believes that schools need a step change in reform to make quality education open to all  We plan a radical improvement in secondary schools, building on our success in primary schools. Our aim is to develop fully the talents of each child. Our ten-year goal is 50 per cent of young adults entering higher education.  We will now:  - ensure every secondary school develops a distinctive mission including the expansion of specialist schools.  - diversify state schools with new City Academies and more church schools.  - direct more money to headteachers, more freedom for successful schools.  - reform provision for 11- to 14-year-olds to ensure higher standards in English, maths, science and information technology.  - introduce new vocational options from 14 onwards, with expanded apprenticeship opportunities  - ensure primary schools offer more chance to learn languages, music and sport, as well as higher standards in the basics.  - provide a good-quality nursery place for every three-year-old.  New Labour believes that the NHS needs radical reform to fulfil its founding principle of quality treatment based on need, not ability to pay  The NHS needs radical reform if it is to be designed around the needs of patients. Investment is vital but not enough. Labours ten-year goal is a maximum waiting time of three months as we become a healthier nation with fast, high-quality treatment, free at the point of use.  We will now:  - decentralise power to give local Primary Care Trusts control of 75 per cent of NHS funding, and cut by two thirds the number of health authorities.  - reform the appointments system so that by the end of 2005 every hospital appointment is booked for the convenience of the patient.  - cut maximum waiting times by the end of 2005 for outpatient appointments from six months to three months and inpatients, from 18 to six months.  - work with the private sector to use spare capacity, where it makes sense, for NHS patients.  - create a new type of hospital  specially built surgical units, managed by the NHS or the private sector  to guarantee shorter waiting times allow successful NHS hospitals to take over failing ones.  New Labour believes that rights and responsibilities should be at the centre of reform of the welfare state to lift children and pensioners out of poverty, and help parents balance work and family  We will continue to reform the tax and benefit system to reward work, not irresponsibility. Our ten-year goals are to achieve full employment in every region, to halve child poverty and tackle pensioner poverty.  We will now:  - create an integrated Child Credit of cash support for children, built on the foundation of universal child benefit.  - establish a new Pension Credit for lower- and middle-income pensioners.  - establish a new Employment First interview for people entering the welfare system, and integrate the Benefits Agency and Employment Service through major reform.  - extend and increase paid maternity leave to £100 each week for six months.  - introduce paid paternity leave.  - expand childcare places to provide for 1.6 million children.  New Labour believes that crime can only be cut by dealing with the causes of crime as well as being tough on criminals  We plan the most comprehensive reform of the criminal justice system since the war  to catch, convict, punish and rehabilitate more of the 100,000 persistent offenders. Our ten-year goal is a modernised criminal justice system with the burglary rate halved.  We will now:  - overhaul sentencing so that persistent offending results in more severe punishment.  - reform custodial sentences so that every offender gets punishment and rehabilitation designed to minimise reoffending.  - reform rules of evidence to simplify trials and bring the guilty to justice.  - introduce specialist, late-sitting and review courts to reflect crime patterns and properly monitor offenders.  - establish a new Criminal Assets Recovery Agency to seize assets of crime barons and a register of dealers to tackle drugs.  - introduce a victims bill of rights providing legal rights to compensation, support and information.  - Renewing public services: education reform Renewing public services: NHS reform.  - Renewing public services: criminal justice reform Renewing public services: welfare refo  Our ten-year goals:  - Fiscal rules consistently met.  - Low inflation and interest rates as low as possible, as we deliver long-term economic stability.  - Faster productivity growth than our main competitors, as we achieve rising living standards for all.  Our next steps:  - Basic skills for 750,000 people.  - Venture capital funds in every region.  - £180 billion investment in transport, with 25 local rail and tram schemes.  - Raise the minimum wage to £4.20.  - £1,000 tax cut  the Childrens Tax Credit  for parents of newborn Children.  - Labours vision for all families: higher wages, affordable mortgages, fairer taxes and better public services.  1. PROSPERITY FOR ALL.  Labours purpose is to help every family, not just a few, to raise their living standards and plan ahead with security. We have a ten-year vision: higher living standards, affordable mortgages and fairer taxes combined with much greater investment in vital public services.  Economic stability is the foundation. We know the price of boom and bust  it was paid in the 1980s and 1990s by millions of hard-working families.  Our reforms since 1997 have helped cut interest rates to nearly half the average under the Conservatives, saving mortgage payers on average £1,200 a year. By 2010, we want Britain to break away from the decades of boom and bust, as we stick to clear rules for spending and borrowing. We will take no risks with economic policy, make no compromise on fiscal responsibility.  Stability comes first. But stability is not enough. We need to produce more, better and to a higher value to raise our earning power and to meet our ten-year goal of faster productivity growth than our main competitors.  We must make Britain the best place to do business in Europe  a dynamic economy, founded on skills and knowledge, developing the talent of all our people, and contributing to sustainable development. That means investment by private and public sectors in infrastructure and skills, and the right competitive framework to support enterprise, small and large, manufacturing and services.  Every extra trained, employed worker contributes to a fairer society, as well as a more prosperous one. With social failure, from school drop-outs to crime, comes economic failure.  Fairness and enterprise go together. It is up to government to do everything it can to help ensure that no individual and no community is left behind.   set up a network of 6,000 IT learning centres around the country.   extend Individual Learning Accounts, which have already been opened by over a million people.   dramatically improve the quality and quantity of prison education.   tackle the financial barriers that prevent adults studying in further education.  Basic skills are the start; updating skills is relevant for all of us. We have created the Learning and Skills Council for all post-school learning outside higher education. Further education colleges have a critical role to play in the future. We will encourage dedicated colleges for under-19s and specialist adult provision to meet local skills needs, with half of all colleges to be recognised as centres of vocational excellence by 2003- 04. The worlds first University for Industry now offers over 400 skills courses. For skill shortages in information technology, we will open two Technology Institutes in every region to meet the rising demand for high-level technical skills.  We need a step-change in workplace learning, particularly in small and medium-sized firms.  We are determined to develop a three-way partnership to bring this about. Current arrangements have secured increased participation, but not enough. Unions and employers have a key role  but we also need to motivate individual employees. Where both sides of industry in a sector agree, we will help set up a statutory framework for training. We will boost the efforts of trade unions to raise skill levels by giving statutory backing to union learning representatives and supporting the Union Learning Fund. Government has a wide-ranging role to play and is seeking to develop a training tax credit. We will look to business and unions to come forward with proposals on how they can contribute to meeting the nations training goals.  Everyone has a responsibility to help deliver a high-skill, high-productivity economy.  INNOVATION.  Science and technology are the basis of new products and industries, both vital to productivity growth. Since 1997 extra investment of £1.5 billion over three years has given science a fresh start, and a new stream of university funding has helped create new links between scientific breakthroughs and new products.  But we need to invest more to be at the cutting edge of science  in biotechnology and genome research. We propose an R&D tax credit to promote business investment in research. We will work for a European patent system by the end of this year to simplify the process of bringing ideas to market. The £235 billion a year, and growing, global market for green technology gives real opportunity to British industry to benefit from a shift to low carbon technologies.  LABOUR REWARDS WORK.  Labour believes that if you work hard you should be able to support a family. We will guarantee a minimum family income of £225 for a 35-hour week; in the next Parliament, an Employment Tax Credit will reward the work of people on low incomes, whether or not they have children (see A modern welfare state).  The first-ever National Minimum Wage for Britain, bitterly opposed at every stage by the Conservatives, has been a success in our first term. It fulfils, after 100 years, a founding ambition of the Labour Party. Up to 1.5 million people, the majority of them women, have been helped; jobs have not been lost. The Low Pay Commission, which we will make permanent, has made clear recommendations for the future. New Labour will raise the minimum wage to £4.10 this October, and is committed, subject to economic conditions, to raising it to £4.20 in October 2002.  LABOUR REWARDS SAVING.  Nine million people invested in ISAs in their first year. To encourage more saving, we will maintain the £7,000 contribution limit for the next Parliament. We will help pensioners: the Pension Credit will match private saving with government funds, and pensioners will no longer be penalised because of their thrift (See A modern welfare state). To boost the savings habit, we will create a new Savings Gateway for people on lower incomes where their savings will be matched by the government.  To raise living standards, our ambition is to raise our productivity faster than our competitors and to ensure our goods and services are competitive in world markets.  Labour has four priorities:  1. Investment in skills and innovation  SKILLS:  We are passionate about giving every child the chance of a decent education. But we are equally determined to offer learning opportunities to adults. Our ambition is for everyone to have the opportunity to train, in a partnership of employers, employees and government, each giving time and/or money to raise standards of skills in the UK. Our first priority is to help the estimated seven million adults who lack basic literacy and numeracy skills, with 750,000 people achieving basic skill levels by 2004.  We will:   ensure that job seekers get the benefit of a basic skills test, as well as incentives and obligations to take courses to tackle literacy and/or numeracy problems continue to encourage the best scientists to work in the UK, as well as making the most of our science base in universities (see Worldclass public services).  2. SUPPORTING BRITISH BUSINESS.  Government cannot make a business successful. But government must create the right framework to help business achieve healthy long-term growth.  Since 1997, corporation tax rates have been cut to their lowest levels ever. Companies no longer face a perverse incentive to pay out dividends rather than invest for the future.  Reform of capital gains tax has given the entrepreneur or investor new incentives for investment. We support vital investment through the tax system  with allowances for high tech as well as small business investment.  The Myners report has identified weaknesses in our venture capital market, undermining longterm investment and economic dynamism.  We will act on its recommendations, including the abolition of the minimum funding requirement and reforms to pension fund management, and review progress in two years.  When people have worked hard, they want their money to go as far as possible.  Competition policy has already helped cut cash-machine charges and new car prices.  We will extend our fair and robust competition regime by giving more independence to the competition authorities. We will toughen the laws on rogue traders, unfair terms in contracts, and loan sharks.  In the labour market, minimum standards for people at work offer dignity and self-esteem.  Regulation should be introduced, where it is necessary, in a light-touch way. We will cut back the red tape associated with regulation, examine opportunities to put time limits on regulations, deregulate by secondary legislation, and offer help to small firms.  Over 150,000 small businesses have been set up since 1997. We will develop the Small Business Service as an advocate for small business in government and a servant of small businesses around the country. We are committed to reforming the tax treatment of small business, including VAT, and to seeking a reduction in payroll burdens. Small business will also benefit from extending the 10p tax band. We will reform the bankruptcy laws to ensure second chances for people who go bankrupt through no fault of their own, and provide funds for new start-ups. We will also promote the development of entrepreneurship in the school curriculum.  We will modernise company law to promote transparency, reduce burdens on small business and promote long-term economic success. We welcome the recommendations of the Co-operative Commission, which also covered the significant mutual sector, and will examine them with a view to strengthening these important parts of our economy.  3. MODERNISING OUR INFRASTRUCTURE FOR THE INFORMATION AGE.  Digital nation. The infrastructure of the future includes fast, efficient and affordable communication  telecommunications, the internet and broadcasting. That requires the best competitive environment, effective regulation and continued public and private investment in the technologies of the future.  A digital divide would hurt business as well as individuals: universal access is vital to effective markets. We will put all government services on-line by 2005, to improve access to services and spur business on-line. We will work to ensure that broadband, which allows fast internet access, is accessible in all parts of the country.  English is the language of the internet. We have the best TV in the world. The next challenge is to open up the learning opportunities and enjoyment offered by digital TV and the internet to every household. We are committed to making the switchover from analogue to digital signals as soon as conditions for access and cost have been met.  The governance of this fast-changing industry is out of date. We will merge the five separate regulators into one, to create the worlds most competitive and advanced regulatory system.  We believe in the value and necessity of public service broadcasting and have committed to major funding increases for the BBC and to supporting a publicly owned Channel 4 and S4C.  Ofcom will ensure a level playing field, benefiting consumers in terms of choice, price and quality, in particular through promoting competition.  TRANSPORT.  A strong economy needs good transport. Yet our inheritance was massive under-investment, with British Rail broken into over a hundred privatised pieces, and bus services in decline.  Labours priority is to improve and expand The foundation of opportunity and prosperity is economic stability. We know the risks of promises that cannot be paid for: the Conservatives led Britain into two deep recessions, double-digit inflation, record unemployment, 15 per cent interest rates and a doubling of the national debt.  Choice, not chance, has turned things round.  Independence for the Bank of England and longterm fiscal rules have given the UK the most stable and transparent economic framework in Europe. Britain now has the best combination of low interest rates, low inflation and low unemployment since the 1960s.  We are saving nearly £9 billion this year from debt and unemployment, so 84p of every extra pound of public spending goes on national priorities, compared to 58p under the Conservatives.  So we will pursue a balanced approach on the economy with stability the foundation, more investment not less and, as affordable, targeted tax cuts on our priorities.  Our aim is to put more wealth in the hands of more people. That is why we will keep mortgage rates as low as possible, ensure competition keeps down household bills, support savings and share ownership, and create a new Child Trust Fund for every child at birth to invest for when they reach adulthood.  There are no guarantees in an integrated world economy. But we showed during the Asian economic crisis how to steer a course of stability in turbulent times. We will continue to work at international level to minimise global economic turbulence, and to protect Britain if it occurs.  TAX AND SPENDING.  Fiscal responsibility and monetary stability are the foundation of our future plans. New Labours inflation target is 2.5 per cent. We will continue to meet our fiscal rules: over the economic cycle we will borrow only to invest, and keep net debt at a stable and prudent level.  We are pledged to raise health and education spending for the next three years at twice the rate of the Conservative years. Labour will double net public investment. And we are on track to save £1 billion in the costs of government purchasing by 2003.  Tax policy will be governed by the health of the public finances, the requirement for public investment, and the needs of families, business and the environment.  We have rewarded work through the new 10p starting rate of tax and the Working Families Tax Credit. The basic rate of tax has been cut to 22p. We will support families through the new Childrens Tax Credit, set at up to £1,000 a year for new parents  the first recognition of the costs of children in the tax system for 20 years.  On average, UK households have benefited by £590 a year from personal tax and benefit measures introduced since 1997. During this Parliament, living standards have risen by ten per cent for a single earner family on average earnings. To help those who work and save, we will extend the 10p tax band. We will continue to tackle tax avoidance.  We will not raise the basic or top rates of income tax in the next Parliament. We renew our pledge not to extend VAT to food, childrens clothes, books, newspapers and public transport fares.  The fundamentals Better off with Labour The productivity challenge Staying better off Investing in business first-class engineering More security and support for families with Labour: lower household bills, smaller mortgages and tax and benefit reform to help children  We also intend the local post office to become an invaluable resource for access to government information. There will be increased incentives for people to take over and modernise post offices. Business customers, representing by far the majority of the Post Offices turnover, want a full range of express, parcels and logistics services. We have given the Post Office greater commercial freedom in the public sector. It needs to be able to gain an advantage in the new postal market and become a leading force in domestic and international postal services through alliances and joint ventures. We want to help the Post Office keep up with the best in a fast-changing market.  ENERGY.  Labour is committed to a secure, diverse and sustainable supply of energy at competitive prices. We have brought full competition to the gas and electricity markets. Coal and nuclear energy currently play important roles in ensuring diversity in our sources of electricity generation.  We are putting an obligation on electricity companies to deliver ten per cent of the UK's electricity from renewable sources by 2010, with a doubling of combined heat and power.  We will consider setting further targets for renewables, with particular focus on offshore wind, solar and biomass technologies, supported by a £100 million fund. It will back up the Climate Change Levy, which includes agreements to improve efficiency in energyintensive sectors, and the new Carbon Trust, which will recycle £100 million to accelerate the take-up of cost-effective, low-carbon technologies. We will support research into clean coal technology and investigate its commercial possibilities. We will double the expenditure on energy efficiency. Fuel poverty blights lives: our aim is that by 2010 no vulnerable household in the UK need risk illhealth due to a cold home.  BNFL is an important employer and major exporter. The government insists it maintains the highest health, safety and environmental standards. We are examining the scope for turning the company into a public-private partnership.  4. EUROPE AND THE WIDER WORLD.  Labour will be engaged and influential, fighting for the British national interest, as we set out in Britain strong in the world. We will support British Trade International, which gives business direct access to UK posts abroad, and maintain the UKs position as the location of choice within Europe for multinational business.  Labours position on the single currency was set out by the Chancellor in October 1997 and reiterated by the Prime Minister in February 1999. We have made it clear that, provided the economic conditions are met, membership of a successful Euro would bring benefits to Britain in terms of jobs, investment and trade. So, in principle, we are in favour of joining a successful single currency. But, in practice, the five economic tests we have set out must be met before the government would recommend entry to the single currency. An assessment of the tests will be carried out early in the next Parliament. If the government and Parliament recommend entry, the British people will have the final say in a referendum.  So the choice is between a Conservative Party which will deny the people of Britain the chance to join, even if it is in our national interest to do so  and the Labour Party which says that, if it is in our national economic interest, the decision should be made by the British people in a referendum.  Britain is better off than in 1997  but our ambition is to widen the winners circle so more people share in the benefits of economic growth. In A modern welfare state we set out the route to full employment.  FAIR AND FLEXIBLE WORK.  We are proud of our commitment to combine a dynamic economy with fair standards in the workplace. Labour has put right historic wrongs.  Every employee now has the right to four weeks paid holiday; trade unions have the right to recognition where a majority of the workforce want it; part-time workers have proper rights.  Our objective has been to promote fairness consistent with the competitive position of British business. That will continue to be our position.  We have reformed the labour market to build a durable and fair basis for constructive employee relations. As we learn from the reforms, we will keep their effectiveness under review. We want to strengthen partnership at work, which can foster employee commitment and help at a time of industrial change. We have established the Partnership Fund and want to expand it.  Information and consultation need to be appropriate to national traditions, with timely discussion of problems. When large-scale redundancies are being considered, there is an especially strong case for consultation. The government is reviewing the effectiveness of the UKs current arrangements for information and consultation  works councils in larger firms operating across Europe as well as consultation on large-scale redundancies. We will implement the findings of our review in this area. We support conciliation in the workplace to avoid resort to litigation. We will examine reforms that promote efficiency and fairness.  Women still suffer an 18 per cent pay gap compared to men. We are committed to tackling the causes of this inequality. We will work with employers and employees to develop effective proposals, building on good practice and the sound business case, in both the private and public sectors.  We will develop career services for all. We aim for a ten per cent cut in death and major injuries at work by 2010 and will clarify responsibility, improve enforcement and toughen penalties for offences. We are also committed to working with managers and employees to reduce the problems of bullying and violence in the workplace. As a major employer, our ambition is to improve the quality of work for our employees  helping recruitment and retention.  PROSPERITY FOR EVERY REGION.  REGIONS.  Balanced and sustainable growth depends on every region developing its capacity to the full.  Sitting back and leaving regional problems to the market is not acceptable. The causes of disparities within and between regions must be addressed. The new regional economic policy must be based on boosting regional capacity for innovation, enterprise and skill development, modernising regional infrastructure and improving university/industry links. This is why Regional Development Agencies (RDAs) have been set up and why they now have extra money and new freedoms.  We will work in partnership with local people to ensure that all regions and communities build on their own strengths. Our task is to anticipate change, handle restructuring and enable businesses to move into high-skill, high value-added product markets. Labours Job Transition Service will provide an intensive and personalised response to large-scale redundancies, helping people secure work or acquire new skills. The JTS will focus its work on new Employment Action Plans drawn up by local economic partners.  railway and road travel. Our ten-year Transport Plan, supported by all the key players, matches large resources with major reform. £180 billion of investment, split between railways, roads and local transport and delivered in partnership with the private sector, offers real hope to motorists and passengers alike.   Rail: Passenger numbers have risen by 17 per cent since 1997, and freight increased by 22 per cent. But recent crises have proved the need for urgent investment and strong regulation. With Labour, £60 billion will be spent on upgrading the rail network, with the majority of rolling stock replaced. Five hundred new carriages are already in use, another 3,000 ordered. We plan to expand capacity to boost passenger levels by 50 per cent, and freight by more. Safer train protection systems are now being installed and will be extended following Lord Cullens report into rail safety.  The Strategic Rail Authority (SRA) has been set up to provide strong, strategic direction.  Train companies will get longer franchises in return for higher investment and improved services. The SRA will lead the expansion of the network, using public-private partnerships (PPPs). Railtrack is being reformed to focus on the operation of existing track and signalling.  The Rail Regulator, with strengthened powers, will ensure the delivery of higher standards, increased safety and increased investment by the company.  London will benefit from new trains and reduced overcrowding on its commuter services.  We support plans to build a new East-West Cross-rail tunnel and to extend the East London Line. We have pledged increased, long-term investment in the Tube to underpin a publicprivate partnership to upgrade Tube infrastructure, with operations remaining in the public sector. Our agreement with the London Mayor and Transport Commissioner offers the best chance in a generation to upgrade the Tube.  Supertrams will transform transport in our big cities, with 25 new light rail or tram schemes.  Services have been introduced or expanded in Manchester, Birmingham, Croydon, Sheffield, Nottingham, Tyne and Wear with plans under way for supertrams in Leeds, Portsmouth and Bristol.   Roads: The Transport Plan allocates £60 billion to road improvement. Motorways will be upgraded; a hundred new bypasses will reduce accidents and pollution. But environmentally damaging road schemes have been scrapped; all new roads must now be strictly appraised for maximum benefits and minimum environmental damage. Our trunk roads are the safest in Europe and we aim to reduce serious road casualties by a further 40 per cent over ten years. £8.4 billion is now being invested in local authority schemes in England. We have given local authorities the freedom to choose to use charges to reduce traffic  but we insist they put the money into better transport services. New road safety schemes will mean more school bus services and traffic-free Home Zones where people can walk safely, and children play without danger, to help cut the number of child road deaths and serious injuries by 50 per cent by 2010.  Road tax is being cut on smaller, cleaner cars and duty reduced on greener fuels. Tax incentives are creating a cleaner lorry fleet while the road haulage industry will benefit from steep reductions in Vehicle Excise Duty to among the lowest in Europe. We will also ensure that hauliers from overseas pay their fair share towards the cost of our roads. Smarter driving will be encouraged by new highway communications technology. We are also working with the motor industry on safer, more fuel-efficient vehicles.   Buses: are vital to local journeys. With Labour, 25,000 new buses are already in operation. By 2006, almost the whole national bus fleet will be renewed. Lower concessionary fares have been introduced for over five million older and disabled travellers. Park and ride schemes are increasing, and over 100 towns now have bus services linked to train stations, with cut-price fares. Bus partnerships between local authorities and private bus companies will improve passenger numbers and service quality. Nationally we will work to improve inter-city coach services.  Integrated transport Good transport systems offer choice across transport modes. Transport Direct  a phone and internet system designed to plan journeys and sell tickets  will put transport services at peoples fingertips. Walking and cycling will be encouraged in thousands of local transport schemes. Inland waterways are being revitalised and we will take forward the recommendations of the enquiry into the Marchioness disaster.  International links are also vital. Plans for aviation and airports over the next 30 years will be produced next year. Merchant ships are returning to the British flag. We will complete the high-speed Channel Tunnel Rail Link.  Major national infrastructure projects, such as Heathrow Terminal 5, raise vital issues. We will continue to modernise the planning system and introduce new fast-track procedures for major projects of national significance.  The Post Office and postal services We are committed to high-quality, universal postal services, and a dynamic Post Office which can thrive in a world of technological change and increased competitive pressure.  Labour is working with the banks to offer a new universal banking service. This will allow all benefit and pension recipients to receive their payments, at no charge, in full at the post office after the switch to Automated Credit Transfer in Unemployment down: young people benefiting from Labours New Deal Supertram schemes have eased congestion in Manchester (above), Birmingham, Croydon, Sheffield and Nottingham, with plans under way in three more cities o one left behind Helping everyone become better off promote public health and consumer choice  but we must use science to establish the facts, the opportunities and the risks before taking final decisions in an open way.  It is also important to reform the Common Fisheries Policy to preserve fish stocks for the future. In the short term, Labour is providing more than £60 million in structural funds over the next three years to help the industry, including a new decommissioning scheme while also tackling the problem of quota-hoppers.  Economic renewal.  The economic hub of a rural area is often a thriving market town. That is why Labour is committing an extra £100 million of public and private funding over the next three years for the renewal of market towns. RDAs will be charged with renewal of rural as well as urban areas.  We will support village life with rate relief for pubs, garages and shops, as well as farmers who diversify part of their activity into other enterprises.  Tourism is a vital, growing industry for Britain, with 1.8 million employees, and links to the museums, arts and heritage that people want to enjoy. Quality is our platform  which is why we now have a unified grading scheme for hotels and guest houses in England, and new training and New Deal opportunities. We will support well-targeted promotion, regional programmes linked to RDAs, and high-quality information via the internet. Traditional tourist resorts face special problems, so we have extended the assisted area map to include many seaside resorts and have negotiated an extension to the European Union regeneration funding so that seaside towns throughout the country can start rebuilding their economy.  RURAL LIFE.  Labour is pledged to a rural services standard to set out specifically what rural people can expect from 21 public service providers  with annual auditing and commitments to service improvement. The rural school closure programme has been ended; 3,000 new, affordable homes a year are on the way; a £30 million police programme will help cut rural crime; £239 million over three years has been set aside for rural transport services; and the Post Office is now obliged to prevent closure of rural post offices except in unavoidable circumstances, with £270 million to help achieve this and recruit sub-postmasters.  Labour is determined to protect Britains landscapes and wildlife. Planning, transport and energy policy all make a difference. We have also designated the first new national parks since 1948 and brought consensus to a large increase in access to open countryside. We will press ahead with an £8 billion programme for water companies to clean up rivers and minimise damage from waste. The dangers of coastal and inland flooding are now widely appreciated, and we are committed to investment in preventative solutions, including more sensitive use of agricultural land. We have increased the number of protected nature sites. We have also initiated important steps to improve animal welfare in Britain, and argued successfully for higher welfare standards for battery hens and pigs across the EU.  Leadership for the future.  Labour is committed to support our countryside and the people who live and work in it. We are committed to create a new department to lead renewal in rural areas  a Department for Rural Affairs.  Independent and wide-ranging views are essential to the development of strategic and long-term policy. We will set up an independent commission to advise on how we create a sustainable, competitive and diverse farming and food sector within a thriving rural economy which advances environmental, health and animal welfare goals.  Coalfield communities.  Labour is committed to a ring-fenced £400 million package of help for Britains ex-mining communities. This will support local regeneration, including support for new businesses. We will ensure that compensation due is paid quickly.  We will also honour our commitment to ex-miners.  suffering industrial diseases. We have set aside £4 billion to compensate those men who suffered from lung disease and vibration white finger after working in Britains mining industry and the widows who nursed them.  Britain led the first industrial revolution. Other countries got ahead in the second industrial revolution.  Now our ambition is for Britain to succeed in the third industrial revolution  enhancing knowledge, speeding up communication and developing the talents of all the British people.  Our commitment is to use the £1.2 billion rising to £1.7 billion a year now pledged to RDAs to promote business start-ups, strengthen links between business and universities, for example through university innovation centres and the establishment of a Centre for Manufacturing Excellence in every region to help firms develop.  They will develop venture capital funds to boost wealth-creating capacity.  The Conservatives are so obsessed with the market and so out of touch with what goes on beyond Westminster that they even want to scrap RDAs  and with them the vital jobs, inward investment and prosperity that they bring.  Urban renewal.  Eighty per cent of people live in urban and innercity Britain. We are ambitious for Britains urban areas: we want to make them better places to live and better places to set up a business. The New Deal for Communities, worth £1.9 billion over three years, and the £900 million Neighbourhood Renewal Fund (see A modern welfare state), as well as our reforms to local governance (see Strong and safe communities) will drive forward progress.  Labour offers £1 billion of tax cuts over the next five years to increase capital investment in urban areas, for new businesses and for new housing. Labour will reform the planning system to speed up decision-making, promote the most efficient use of land, and strike the right balance of environmental protection, safer communities and economic growth. We have put urban renewal at the heart of the planning system and set a target of 60 per cent of new house building to be on brownfield land or provided through the conversion of existing buildings. Two Millennium Villages have set high standards in design. We will designate more in other parts of the country and continue to raise standards of urban design, with a quality mark to tackle cowboy builders.  Housing.  Lower interest rates enable more people to own their own homes. Labour will make it easier for people buying and selling homes through a new sellers pack, through grants for low-income homeowners, and help for key workers in highcost areas. We will honour our commitment to tackle homelessness. We will continue to promote housing choice, with reforms to leasehold and commonhold law, a licensing scheme for houses in multiple occupation, and new powers for council tenants. We will develop a modern basis for land registration to make conveyancing faster and cheaper. We will also examine the ways in which tenants can be helped to gain an equity stake in the value of their home.  Labour is committed to reducing by one third the backlog of sub-standard housing by 2004, with all social housing brought up to a decent standard by 2010. We will seek to reduce the use of costly bed-and-breakfast accommodation.  We propose additional investment of £1.8 billion over the next three years. Some local authorities will continue to provide high-quality council housing. We are supporting the transfer of 200,000 dwellings per year, where tenants agree, to social landlords like housing associations, and new arms-length council housing companies. We will also help 10,000 key workers buy their own homes in high-cost areas to tackle recruitment problems.  Rural Britain.  The recent outbreak of foot and mouth disease has caused strain and distress in rural areas.  Labours priorities have been clear: to eradicate the disease as quickly and effectively as possible, to compensate those directly affected, and to protect the wider economy. As the number of new cases falls significantly, and the clean-up of infected areas gathers pace, we are committed to help the most affected regions with a recovery plan including advice on sustainable restocking, organic conversion, and early retirement and outgoer schemes. We will conduct a scientific review of how to prevent animal disease outbreaks from occurring in the future, and will introduce tough rules to back this up. But we must also learn some of the wider lessons.  Agriculture and fishing.  Since the Second World War the economy of rural areas has undergone massive change.  About two per cent of the national workforce are now employed in agriculture. But the industry is particularly important because of the links with food production, our landscape and our environment. Labours aim is to promote economic renewal with a sustainable future for farming, strengthened communities and sustainable land use.  Short-term pressures need to be met. Since the early 1990s, sectors of farming have been hard hit by BSE, the weakness of the Euro and falling world commodity prices. Labour has provided £1.35 billion in short-term relief for farmers, including aid for diversification, farm business advice, better marketing, small slaughterhouses and restructuring of the industry. We have minimised many regulatory burdens and improved the way food safety, environmental and animal health regulations are implemented.  But British agriculture will only thrive in the longer term through a further, radical reorientation of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP), away from distorting Europe-wide production subsidies towards more national responsibility for domestic farming, environmental and rural development priorities.  CAP reform is now more possible; Labours engagement with the EU gives us the best chance of making it happen.  We have begun the process of change with our farming strategy and our seven-year, £3 billion Rural Development Plans for England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Labour will expand this programme so farming can become more diverse and responsive to consumers, and produce in a way that sustains and improves the environment. We have already increased payments for organic conversion from £0.5 million to £18 million, and will increase them further.  We have set up an independent, open and consumer-focused Food Standards Agency to ensure that all food meets the highest standards.  We will argue for the extension of food labelling, to give consumers more choice. Genetically modified (GM) foods and crops have caused concern despite stringent safety checks. There should be high standards of safety  regulation must be strict, to protect the environment and Urban renewal is at the heart of the planning systemow Labour makes you better off: an Employment Tax Credit Labour is committed to protecting Britains landscapes and wildlife Primary excellence... the big improvements already made in primary schools are to be extended to secondary education Our ten-year goals:  - 50 per cent of young people entering higher education, as we raise standards in secondary schools.  - Maximum waiting time of three months for any stage of treatment, as we become a healthier nation with fast, high-quality treatment free at the point of use.  Our next steps:  - Every secondary school with a distinct ethos, mission and centre of excellence  - Recruit an extra 10,000 teachers More power to frontline staff with budgets for ward sisters and consultants and 75 per cent of NHS spending controlled by Primary Care  Trusts.  More health service workers  20,000 more nurses, and at least 10,000 more GPs and consultants Free access to national museums and galleries The whole country depends on high-quality public services.  We have a ten-year vision for Britains public services: record improvement to match record investment, so they deliver high standards to all the people, all the time, wherever they live.  Since 1997 there has been investment with reform. Thanks to committed public servants, we have shown that rapid progress is possible and have begun to break the fatalism that says public services are always second class. Now is the time to move forward. Economic stability makes more investment possible.  Labour will put education and healthcare first. We promise reform to match. We will decentralise power within a clear framework of national standards to increase the quality and diversity of public services and meet the challenge of rising expectations.  In education, we offer step-change in secondary schools to match the vast improvements in primary schools already achieved. Every school will have a clear mission, with more teachers, new types of school, new opportunities for children and education tailored to fufil their potential. By 2010, we want a majority of Britains young people entering higher education.  In health, we will recruit 20,000 extra nurses and at least 10,000 extra doctors. Our ten-year goal is a healthier nation, with fast, high-quality treatment meeting rising expectations and demographic and technological challenges. Doctors and nurses will be in the driving seat of reform.  The job of government is also about ensuring that the enjoyment, excitement and inspiration of arts and sport come alive for everyone. In all our public services, the key is to devolve and decentralise power to give freedom to frontline staff who perform well, and to change things where there are problems. Services need to be highly responsive to the demands of users. Where the quality is not improving quickly enough, alternative providers should be brought in. Where private-sector providers can support public endeavour, we should use them. A spirit of enterprise should apply as much to public service as to business.  2 WORLD-CLASS PUBLIC SERVICES.  while developing a centre of excellence  and their rates of improvement outstrip the national average. Having trebled their number since 1997, we have pledged to expand their numbers to at least 1,500 by 2006, on the way to making specialist status available to all schools ready for it. We will encourage more church and other faith-sponsored schools, where parents wish it. We will establish more City Academies, and promote greater innovation in the supply of new schools with local consultation. We will allow greater involvement in schools by outside organisations with a serious contribution to make to raising standards. We will extend provision for gifted children as we nurture childrens special talents. As part of our reform of the vital further education sector, we will encourage the development of free-standing sixth-form colleges. Schools with sixth forms will be guaranteed their funding for pupils in real terms, provided numbers are maintained. We are committed to expand Educational Maintenance Allowances so they cover 30 per cent of the country, and build upon them on the basis of the experience. Pupils will be given greater opportunities through the promotion of partnerships between schools. We will build on the partnerships established between the state and private sectors.  Better infrastructure.  We will invest nearly £8 billion in school buildings and equipment over the next three years, including the construction of 650 new or completely refurbished schools. IT has enormous potential to raise standards, and it is vital that every child leaves school able to make use of the new technologies. Today, nearly all schools are connected to the internet. Labour is committed to spend £1.8 billion over six years on equipping our schools for the information age. We will pioneer Curriculum Online to ensure materials are available to pupils in school and at home. We are committed to continue to extend access to IT for pupils and teachers, including the possibility of a national leasing scheme to make top-quality hardware available at very low prices.  The right support.  Good schools also depend on parents and the local community. We will continue to ensure that headteachers have the powers they need to tackle disruption and unacceptable behaviour in schools. Local education authorities will focus on supporting school improvement, especially weak and failing schools, and delivering services that cannot be provided by individual schools. We will ensure better training and support for school governors.  Schools should be used more effectively as assets for the whole community, including for childcare and community learning. We will pilot extended hours schools to develop this resource. We will build on the success of more than 40 study centres based in leading football clubs by extending community involvement to other sports. Over time we want to develop safe places for children to play outside school hours and every pupil to have access to a summer school programme. An Academy for Talented Youth will be established in partnership with a leading university to pioneer summer and other dedicated provision for those with special talents. We have significantly improved support and provision for children with special needs or disabilities. They should have access to the best possible education, with appropriate support, whether mainstream or special schooling most suits their needs.  Schools in the toughest areas, and the teachers who work in them, need special support. We will expand the Excellence in Cities programme for urban secondary schools, with extra help for the weakest schools, learning mentors and in-school units to help manage pupil behaviour. Where LEAs cannot effectively support school improvement, alternative provision will be made. For schools facing exceptional pressures, for example very high pupil turnover, we will provide additional support, including significant reductions in the size of teaching groups where appropriate.  Teachers.  Nothing in education is more important than having good teachers. We have made teaching a far more attractive career, through better pay, better incentives to train including training salaries and loan write-offs, more recognition and improved support. The General Teaching Council and National College for School Leadership are both now up and running.  We want teaching to be a career of choice for the best graduates and attractive to people making career changes. We will continue to invest more in the profession and improve conditions for teachers. High status, better salaries and proper professional support are all essential.  We are conducting a strategic review of teacher workload and the right balance between teaching and administration, central direction and local discretion. We will build on its findings significantly to improve support for teachers in the classroom and in administrative tasks, so they can concentrate on their job. We will:   recruit 10,000 extra teachers and improve the adult:pupil ratio   support teachers in the classroom by employing more adults to help them   invest in rapid promotion and rewards for classroom excellence   boost recruitment and retention packages for Labours ambition for public services is simple: we want excellent services for all. Our challenge is to reverse decades of denigration and underinvestment.  The citizen  the patient, the pupil, their needs and aspirations  must be central.  We will work with frontline staff to deliver a revival of our public services that is every bit as profound as the changes to the private sector in the 1980s.  In our first term, national action was vital  to tackle crises of funding and quality. Government must take national responsibility for investment and for setting a clear national framework. Now we need to move on, empowering frontline staff. Each service needs the right structure and incentives at local level  decentralisation of power with strong incentives for high performance. Frontline staff are advocates for citizens, and ambassadors for their services.  Motivated by an ethos of service, they must be supported to carry through change.1 Education remains Labours top priority.  Excellence for the many, not just the few is our driving passion. Our goal is to develop education to harness the individual talents of every pupil.  Since 1997 rising standards have been achieved through major new investment and significant reforms: 17,000 schools have had vital repairs or refurbishment; 20,000 schools are now connected to the internet; there are nearly half a million fewer primary pupils in classes of more than 30; over 150,000 teachers are set to receive a £2,000 pay rise above the usual annual increase; every school is getting additional grants of up to £110,000 paid direct; and there are 11,000 more teachers and over 44,000 more support staff and classroom assistants .  Our partnership with teachers has achieved what OfSTED calls a transformation in primary school standards, thanks to smaller infant class sizes and major reform in the teaching of literacy and numeracy skills. Our task now is to achieve a similar transformation in secondary education, liberating the particular talent of every child. Our pledge to parents is clear: children should be on track to achieve their best, or receiving extra expert help to catch up.  Investment.  Money alone cannot guarantee a good education, but extra investment is indispensable to achieving our ambitions. We pledge a further step-change in investment in return for a further step-change in standards.  In 1997 Labour promised to increase the share of national income devoted to education.  Over this Parliament, we have increased it from 4.7 per cent to 5 per cent  £540 extra per pupil in real terms  and we are pledged to raise it to 5.3 per cent by 2003-04. Investment in buildings and equipment has trebled. During the next Parliament, we will again increase the share of national income for education.  Under-fives.  The early years of a childs life are vital. That is why we are doubling investment in early years education. There is now a free nursery place available for every four-year-old. Our new Foundation Stage provides a distinct phase of learning appropriate for the early years.  By 2004 every three-year-old will be entitled to a free nursery place in the private, voluntary or statutory sector. OfSTED will help drive up standards. Children with special educational needs will have those needs identified earlier.  We will continue to provide services which integrate early years education with childcare.  By 2004 we will have 100 Early Excellence Centres as beacons of good practice providing care and education for children from 0-5; we will set up 500 Sure Start Centres in disadvantaged areas to support childrens early development; and we will provide an extra 100,000 places offering wraparound care linked to early education.  Primary schools.  Primary school teachers have achieved excellent results. In 1997 barely half of 11-yearolds were up to standard in English and maths tests. The figures are now 75 per cent and 72 per cent respectively, well on the way to meeting our targets of 80 per cent in English and 75 per cent in maths by 2002. The lowest-scoring Local Education Authorities (LEAs) are now achieving better results than the national average in 1996.  But Labour will not be satisfied until every child leaves primary school with the basic skills they need. We are setting targets for an 85 per cent success rate for 11-year-olds in English and maths, and will provide further intensive support for teachers to meet them.  Primary education without the basics is a betrayal; but every parent rightly wants far more. We will provide primary pupils with wider opportunities to learn sports, musical instruments and a foreign language.  Secondary schools.  Transforming secondary education is the critical challenge of the next decade. We reject a return to the 11-plus. The principles of inclusion and equality of opportunity remain central to our commitment to liberate the potential of every child. But, on their own, they are not enough to guarantee high standards.  Standards have risen in the past four years, particularly among pupils in less advantaged areas. Strong school leadership and better teaching have turned around 700 failing schools. But the challenge ahead is immense.  Too many pupils fall back and become disillusioned in the first two years of secondary school. Just half of 16-year-olds currently gain good school-leaving qualifications, and levels of drop-out remain too high.  The dramatic advances at primary level mean pupils will increasingly arrive at secondary school demanding the best. We will radically modernise comprehensive schools.  In future every school must have the right leadership. Headteachers must have the freedom and resources necessary to run their schools effectively. We have improved pay and training for headteachers and delegated more funding to schools. Where they demonstrate success, we will further extend their freedom to manage their schools effectively. We will reduce the regulatory burden on all schools.  High standards in the core curriculum We will modernise the secondary curriculum to promote higher standards and better progression from school and college to university or work-based training. All pupils should reach the age of 14 fully competent in a broad range of subjects. Effective teaching is the key. We will develop the literacy and numeracy strategies in secondary schools with the right balance of targets and flexibility, particularly for pupils not up to standard in the basics. We will set demanding targets for high achievement by the large majority of 14-year-old pupils in English, maths, science and IT tests  the passport to future success. We will promote more effective pathways beyond 14, including high-quality vocational routes that build on the new vocational GCSEs and A-levels. We will ensure there is an apprenticeship place for every young person who reaches the required standard.  A mission to achieve.  We want every secondary school to develop a distinct ethos, mission and centre of excellence. Specialist schools offer the full national curriculum to the whole ability range.  Labours number one priority.  The proposals and statistics in this chapter refer to England; reform programmes for Scotland and Wales are detailed in the Scottish and Welsh manifestos.  Nursery places available for all three-year-olds by 2004 Getting a head start... every child needs good IT skills Improved provision for gifted children as Labour nurtures special talents conditions of the staff employed in these schemes. We will seek ways in which, within the framework of PFI management, support staff could remain part of the NHS team.  Improving health.  Our job is not just to improve the nations health service. It is to improve the nations health.  Deaths from cancer and heart disease are too high. There has been a growing health gap between rich and poor. Beyond other commitments to combat child poverty and poor housing, we will tackle the long-standing causes of ill-health and health inequality by:   making the fight against cancer, heart disease and stroke the top priority for investment and reform, with earmarked extra funding of £1 billion by 2004. The number of cardiologists will increase by around half and cancer specialists by nearly a third by 2005 compared to 1999- 2000. Waiting times for cancer treatment will be cut. Our ambition is to prevent 300,000 avoidable deaths over the next decade   tough targets to close the health gap to cut deaths in poorer communities and among poorer children improving mental health services, and a new emphasis on prevention, with more screening services including for conditions like sickle cell disease, cystic fibrosis and newborn hearing problems   offering the worlds best smoking cessation services to help the seven in ten smokers who say they want to give up   giving children aged four to six in nursery and primary schools a free piece of fruit every school day  the biggest boost to child nutrition since free school milk was introduced in 1946.  We remain committed to our bill  blocked by the Tories  to ban tobacco advertising and sponsorship.  Reforming the NHS.  The NHS has to earn the confidence of each new generation. It has to change the way it works if it is to meet todays challenges and provide fast and modern services. With Labour, by 2004 teachers, particularly in high-cost areas and schools facing exceptional challenges   create new routes into teaching, including train-to-teach courses accredited as part of undergraduate degrees and a stronger training mission for outstanding schools   further improve in-service training opportunities for teachers   develop school achievement awards that reward staff in 7,000 fast-improving schools a year   subsidise new PCs for teachers so that they have direct access to the latest technology.  Higher education  a world leader.  Higher education brings on average 20 per cent higher earnings and a 50 per cent lower chance of unemployment. It is time for an historic commitment to open higher education to half of all young people before they are 30, combined with increased investment to maintain academic standards.  In 1997 we inherited a system where the number of qualified people able to go to university was capped. Today, the numbers are rising and universities have the funds to expand, with new two-year foundation degrees to offer students the option of a vocationally relevant, high-quality qualification as a way into skilled work or further study. Over the next three years, we will continue to expand student numbers, taking us towards our 50 per cent target.  We will maintain university entry standards while intensifying efforts to extend the huge advantages that a university education confers to able young people from all backgrounds.  University summer schools, master classes and mentoring support will be offered to potential students from disadvantaged areas through a new Excellence Challenge programme, backed up by £190 million of funding.  We will not introduce top-up fees and have legislated to prevent them. Since 1997 we have increased university funding by more than a billion pounds a year over the Parliament  and invested considerably more in research. Our new system of university finance ensures that 50 per cent of students pay no tuition fees at all, that no parents pay more than under the old system, and that students pay back loans progressively when they are earning. We will ensure that the funding system continues to promote access and excellence.  We will strengthen research and teaching excellence. It is vital that our world-leading universities are able to compete with the best internationally. We will also support world-class research and the development of public-private partnerships. We are determined to ensure that our universities have the freedom and incentives to meet our ambitions for them.  Reforms to the inspection system for teaching will slash red tape for higher performing departments.  For over 50 years the NHS has been part and parcel of what it means to be British. If you fall ill, the NHS is there. Its foundations  tax-based funding and care according to need  remain as valid today as ever.  The NHS employs one million dedicated people.  But it needs far-reaching reform to redesign its services around the needs of patients. Labours ten-year NHS Plan is our strategy for ensuring fast, convenient, high-quality care in all parts of the country. We will implement it through the next Parliament and, if elected, beyond. Reform will be driven through primary care trusts (PCTs) as power and resources are decentralised to frontline staff.  In 1997, waiting lists were at record levels and rising, hospital building had ground to a halt, and the number of nurses working in the NHS had fallen. Today, waiting lists are down by over 100,000 and waiting times are falling. There are 17,000 more nurses, over 6,500 more doctors, and over 9,000 more therapists, scientists and technicians working for patients. The biggest-ever hospital building programme is under way. NHS Direct, the 24-hour nurse helpline, is available across the country. Eye tests for people who are 60 and over are now free.  But there is a lot more to do. We are committed to investment and reform.  With Labour, in just four years the NHS will have grown by a third. Spending on the health service is now rising by an average of over six per cent a year in real terms  the biggest sustained increase in its history and double that under the Conservatives. Provided that as a country we maintain economic stability, we will, if elected, be able to sustain significant funding increases throughout the next Parliament. So over time we will bring UK health spending up to the EU average.  The fundamentals of care.  That money will help us get the basics right.  By 2005 there will be 10,000 more doctors and 20,000 more nurses, with ward sisters in charge of ward budgets. Matrons will make sure that hospital food is good and wards are clean, with power to stop payments to contractors who fail to keep hospitals up to scratch.  Nightingale wards for older people and mixed sex wards will be abolished, and mental health wards will be modernised. There will be 7,000 extra beds in hospitals and in intermediate care. And we will build 100 new hospital developments by 2010 and 500 one-stop primary care centres, with over 3,000 GP premises modernised by 2004. We are investing an extra £7 billion of capital investment into the health service. We have said that Private Finance Initiative (PFI) should not be delivered at the expense of the pay and Health Quality services from a growing NHS Above: More flexible working hours for NHS staff Left: A bright future for frontline staff and patients view. We will then enable Parliament to reach a conclusion on this issue. If the issue continues to be blocked we will look at how the disagreement can be resolved.We have no intention whatsoever of placing restrictions on the sports of angling and shooting.  Arts.  Thirty million people enjoy arts activities each year. The arts are crucial to national life, with a huge importance for the creative and tourist industries. Yet the Conservatives introduced charges for our national museums and galleries, cut the arts budget, and reduced support for arts education. Since 1997 that has changed. National museums are already free for children and pensioners. Labour is committed to reform the VAT system to ensure they will be made free for everyone from December. By 2004, arts funding will be 60 per cent above its 1997 level in real terms. An extra £25 million a year will go to regional theatre, increasing the number and quality of productions for audiences in England. We have invested in our orchestras, and put an extra £10 million a year into developing our regional museums and galleries. We have maintained our commitment to the nations heritage and to its historic buildings, and we will continue our drive to put architectural quality at the heart of the design of new public buildings.  Education is the bedrock of an artistic society.  We are once again giving children the opportunity to learn music, and we will ensure the opportunity is available to all. New creative partnerships  linking schools with artists and arts organisations particularly in disadvantaged areas  will offer children the chance to develop artistic and creative talents. We will build on the pilot projects. We have made the largest-ever investment in computerising libraries; all will be on-line by 2002, with guaranteed standards to meet users needs.  From 2002, Culture On-line will offer children and adults alike tailored access to our national collections and cultural activity over the internet. We 23 22 Olympics and Paralympics thrilled everyone.  Labour is committed to a radical extension of sporting opportunities and facilities. Sport is a good health policy, a good crime reduction policy, a good way of building communities.  We pledge a sports entitlement for all children, giving them access to at least two hours a week of sport in or after school. Thanks to our ban on the enforced sale of playing fields and a commitment of nearly £1 billion to new sports facilities and 1,000 school sports co-ordinators, all children will be offered coaching and competitive games.  Children with talent need more investment: we have pledged to fund 200 specialist sports colleges. We will maintain the elite funding we put in place for individual athletics, with a first-class athletics stadium for the World Athletics Championships in 2005 and a new stadium in Manchester for next years Commonwealth Games.  We are committed to sell the Tote to a racing trust to allow it to compete commercially, with all long-term profits invested in the sport. We are committed to finding ways to support the amateur sports clubs to which 5.6 million people now belong.  The House of Commons elected in 1997 made clear its wish to ban fox-hunting. The House of Lords took a different view (and reform has been blocked). Such issues are rightly a matter for a free vote and we will give the new House of Commons an early opportunity to express its will create new specialist arts schools and city academies to offer specialist education to the most talented young people.  Public money devoted to the arts should be spent on excellent art, not bureaucracy. The Arts Council is undergoing substantial reform  creating a simpler structure which gives more power to the regions, cuts bureaucratic costs further, and which can deliver a better service to individual artists and arts organisations. We will ensure that our arts funding system backs excellence, giving artists and arts organisations the long-term stability they need to become world leaders.  Creative industries.  The creative industries are a vital engine of our economy, providing jobs for over one million people. The National Endowment for Science, Technology and the Arts (NESTA) has been set up to back our most talented young people.  Creative entrepreneurs need seed funding, cheap accommodation near other similar companies, and advice on how to develop their talent into a business. To meet those needs, we now plan to provide start-up advice, services and funding for new businesses.  Venture capital will be available through RDAs, and a creative industries champion will be appointed in every Business Link.  Lottery.  Under the Conservatives, many communities missed out on their fair share of lottery money.  The number of grants to community groups has trebled with Labour. Yet there are still communities which have received a disproportionately small share of lottery funding. We will ensure a fairer deal for them.  Labour has reshaped the lottery to match peoples priorities. Money goes for revenue as well as capital. The New Opportunities Fund (NOF) directs help to education, health and the environment  after-school clubs, vital cancerbeating equipment, local green spaces.  We backed going ahead with the Dome as an opportunity to showcase British talent and give people a good day out in millennium year.  Despite being enjoyed by more than six million visitors, the Dome did not fulfil expectations and we have learned the lessons, good and bad, from it. But the development of the Dome has been the catalyst for unlocking the value of the North Greenwich peninsula and regenerating local communities.  We need a revolution in the status, standards and focus of our public services. Labour is prepared to make the investment in staff and services  and we are ready to match investment with reform. Patients will be able to see a GP within 48 hours.  By the end of 2005 we will cut maximum waiting times for outpatient appointments from six months to three months, and for inpatients from 18 months to six months by expanding staff numbers and reforming how care is delivered. Major conditions like cancer and heart disease will have priority, with all patients treated according to clinical urgency.  We will give patients more choice. We have restored the right of family doctors to refer patients to the hospital that is right for them. Now we will redesign the system around the needs of patients. Same day tests and diagnosis will become the norm. By extending the use of NHS Direct and increasing the numbers of dentists, patients will get easier access to NHS dentistry wherever they live. Specially built surgical units  managed by the NHS or the private sector  will guarantee shorter waiting times. We will use spare capacity in private-sector hospitals, treating NHS patients free of charge, where high standards and value for money are guaranteed.  It would be wrong to push people into paying for their operations. That is why we reject the approach of the Conservatives, which would lead to this outcome.  By the end of 2005 every hospital appointment will be booked for the convenience of the patient, making it easier for patients and their GP to choose the hospital and consultant that best suits their needs. From next year, if an operation is cancelled on the day of surgery for non-clinical reasons, the hospital will have to offer another binding date within 28 days, or fund the patients treatment at the time and hospital of the patients choice.  By modernising all maternity units, increasing the number of midwives and giving women greater choice over childbirth, we will ensure that women receive the highest quality maternity care.  There will be tough new standards for care of children, the elderly and people with conditions like diabetes, kidney failure, multiple sclerosis, Parkinsons disease and epilepsy.  We will further tackle the lottery of care as we direct local health authorities and trusts to fund drugs and treatments recommended by the National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE).  Genetic services will be extended in the NHS so that more patients enjoy the benefit of the latest advances in testing and treatment; but we will ban by law human cloning, and implement a moratorium on the use of genetic tests for insurance, following a recommendation of the Human Genetics Commission. We will continue to examine demographic and technological challenges as they affect the NHS.  Patients will have more say, as in the NHS Plan.  We will give every citizen a personal smartcard containing key medical data giving access to their medical records. Older people, people with disabilities and their carers will be able to decide which services they want, with the choice of having cash given to them directly by local councils.  Patients will be represented on trust boards and have more information on local services quality.  Power devolved.  To achieve this vision there will be clear national standards but greater decentralisation to frontline services and to the staff who run them.  Locally agreed personal medical services schemes will be extended. By 2004 all local healthcare will be organised by primary care trusts (PCTs) run by frontline doctors and nurses. Together with the new care trusts, combining health and social services, PCTs will control 75 per cent of NHS funding. With more power for PCTs we will cut the number of health authorities by two-thirds and devolve to the remainder the functions of NHS Regional Offices. We will use the savings of £100 million a year for investment in frontline services.  Hospitals and other local services will have greater control over their own affairs and access to a £500 million performance fund, while consistently failing NHS hospitals will be taken over by successful NHS hospitals.  Appointments to trust boards will no longer be made by ministers but by an independent panel.  NHS staff.  None of these ambitions will be possible without major investment in the skill, working conditions and working practices of all NHS staff. There will be extra pay too in high-cost areas, with pressure relieved through expanded staff numbers, reformed working practices and investment in training.  Every NHS employer will offer more flexible working hours for staff and especially nurses.  Childcare provision will be improved and we will offer targeted subsidies for childcare for NHS staff. The pay system will be reformed to make it fairer. As set out in the NHS Plan, there will be new contracts for GPs and hospital consultants, coupled to extra money. We will examine the case for a public-private partnership with a commercial mortgage lender to make home ownership more affordable for nurses and other staff.  We will set up a University of the NHS to guarantee to staff at all levels opportunities for training and career development. Healthcare assistants, porters, cooks and cleaners will be offered an individual learning account worth £300 a year to develop their careers. We will examine the potential for sabbaticals to help GPs, consultant nurses and consultants keep their skills up to date.  There will be new systems to learn from when things go wrong, a core education curriculum for all health professionals and reforms to modernise the way health professions are regulated. We will take action to protect NHS staff from violence and abuse, and reform the clinical negligence system.  This is a vision worth fighting for. It will take time to achieve, but this is the most comprehensive plan ever put before the British people to improve the state of the nations health and our health service. It will deliver an NHS to be proud of.  The arts and sports are key to our quality of life.  They matter for their own sake. Millions make their living out of their creativity. Government can and must make sure the opportunities are there.  But, for the last 20 years, under-investment, misplaced priorities, and lack of organisation held back access and excellence.  Since 1997 this has begun to change. We have started to invest and to reform the system.  Investment in theatre develops the film and television stars of tomorrow; investment in sport will produce the Olympic and Paralympic medal winners of 2012.  Culture and sport should not be seen as peripheral issues  they are vital to our identity and enjoyment as a country. We are pledged to the investment necessary to expand access and excellence together in culture and sport, building on excellence in film and broadcasting.  Sport.  The performance of British athletes at the Sydney tackle climate change Culture and sport Cultural heritage an extra £10 million a year has been allotted to regional galleries, such as the Lowry in Salford Sporting chance Labour is committed to a sports entitlement for all children  Employment for all is Labours goal, with help for young people from the New Deal Our ten-year goals  Sustain a higher percentage of people in work than ever before, as we seek full employment in every region.  Child poverty halved and pensioner poverty tackled, as we extend opportunity for all children and security for all pensioners.  Our next steps:  - An Employment First interview for everyone coming on to benefits.  - Expanded support for children through tax and benefit reform.  - Extend and increase paid maternity leave and introduce paid paternity leave.  - New pension credit for lower- and middle-income pensioners, and the Winter Fuel Payment retained.  - £900 million Neighbourhood Renewal Fund for jobs, education and crime Prevention.  3. A MODERN WELFARE STATE.  As society changes, so the welfare state must change. We have a ten-year vision for an active welfare state: to promote work for those who can, security for those who cannot, and rewards for those who save, volunteer, learn or train.  Since 1997, we have cut the costs of unemployment, saving £4 billion last year. As a result, we have been able to spend more on tackling poverty and raising family support within a social security budget that has grown, in Labours first term, at the lowest rate since 1948.  Employment is not just the foundation of affordable welfare, it is the best anti-poverty, anti-crime and pro-family policy yet invented. After years of mass unemployment, full employment is now on the agenda. Our ten-year goal is to sustain a higher percentage of people in work than ever before. With more than one million more people in work than in 1997, and a million vacancies in the economy, we need to extend the New Deal, not abolish it as the Conservatives propose.  We judge our society by how we treat the young and the old. In this Parliament, over one million children have been taken out of poverty; our ten-year goal is to halve child poverty, ending it in a generation. We will transform support for children to achieve it.  For those in retirement, security depends on partnership between state and funded provision. We promise that, within two years, no pensioner need live on less than £100 per week, increased annually in line with earnings growth. On top of that, we will reward pensioners who save.  Government cannot achieve social inclusion for people, but it can help them achieve it for themselves, by transferring power and opportunity to local communities. That is our promise.  With Labour, the welfare state helps people into work, makes work pay, supports them at work, and demands responsibilities in return. Our ambition is full employment in every region  good for the economy and good for social justice.  The New Deal has already helped to cut longterm youth unemployment by 75 per cent  280,000 young people have been helped into work. Long-term unemployment is down by over 60 per cent. The claimant count is the lowest for 25 years.  But too many people are still denied the opportunity to work. A million people remain unemployed; 100,000 lone parents have come off income support since 1997, but our target is to raise the current 50 per cent employment rate to 70 per cent. Many people with disabilities out of work say they would like to work. Older people, with a wealth of talent and experience, are a resource we cannot afford to waste.  Labour has ended the days of low-grade job schemes. The New Deal leads to real jobs, a lower benefits bill and higher tax receipts. We now need to build on its success, extending it to more people across the country.  We also need to ensure that the barriers to work are pulled down by delivering on our obligation to tackle discrimination so that all people can make the most of their talents.  Making the New Deal a permanent deal  The benefits system we inherited was fragmented, complex and contradictory. We are putting in place clear, consistent rules: those who can work should be in work or in contact with the labour market. As unemployment falls, we need further reform to help people into work.  Labour will introduce a new principle of employment first, with rights and responsibilities balanced at every stage. The contract is simple: quality opportunities for real responsibility.  Something for something is the foundation.  Labour is pledged to create a new Working Age Agency, JobCentre Plus, merging the old Employment Service and Benefits Agency, and focusing on the key skill needs of areas of the country and sectors of the economy. Whoever you are, wherever you live, you will get the opportunities suited to your needs  from one office, one adviser, one system.  The New Deals for young people and older workers will focus on numeracy, literacy, IT skills and presentation. Where people are homeless or suffer drug or mental health problems we will offer specialist support. More than 140,000 adults aged over 25 have been unemployed for over 18 months. Labour will deliver more intensive and flexible help, with increased responsibilities for claimants.  We will offer greater flexibility to personal advisers and encourage greater engagement of employers, with IT training for all New Dealers.  Employment Zones include funding geared to results and public-private partnership. On the basis of the evidence we will consider their extension to new areas and new claimant groups. We will build on the Action Teams for Jobs model, which is targeting 40 of the most severely disadvantaged areas, to tackle the employment gap for ethnic minorities, and devote £45 million to provide stepping stones into employment for the hardest to employ.  All lone parents will be invited to employment interviews to help them seek employment opportunities. We will build on the lessons of the Choices programme, which offers help with learning, work and childcare. Partners of unemployed people with children, like those without children, will also be asked to interviews to discuss their options.  Parents need good-quality and affordable childcare if they are to have real choice about work. For the first time, Britain has a National Childcare Strategy  covering cost, provision and quality. We have already created 300,000 extra childcare places. By 2004 our target is to have childcare places for 1.6 million children.  Our vision is ambitious: safe and reliable childcare nationwide, allowing all parents to combine home and work, confident in the childcare they have chosen. We will help with the costs of childcare through the Childcare Tax Credit  and will look to extend it to people looking after children with disabilities, and shift workers. We will support the commitment of community and voluntary groups to build up a diverse range of childcare  from Early Excellence Centres to neighbourhood nurseries and informal care (see World-class public services).  Many older workers now want to continue in work full- or part-time. Yet one in three people between 50 and state pension age is not working. To help them we will build on the New Deal 50+. To help bridge the divide between work and retirement, we will examine ways to ensure that people will be able to draw on their occupational pension and continue to work parttime for the same employer, phasing their retirement without compromising their pension.  We are exploring how to facilitate the transition from work to positive voluntary activity.  Our ambition of full employment is part of a deal: if you put in a fair days work, the government will ensure you are able to support yourself and your family. The minimum wage is the foundation. But we offer a guarantee of take-home pay too. For people with families, we promise to match your effort with support through the tax system. For those on low incomes without children we will create an Employment Tax Credit to boost their earnings, tackle poverty and improve work incentives.  People with disabilities.  Our ambition is to enable people with disabilities to play a full part in the community. The Disability Rights Commission now ensures full civil rights for people with disabilities; we have legislated so those with special needs or disabilities have equal access to education. We are now committed to extending basic rights and opportunities, as indicated in our response to the Disability Rights Taskforce.  We are requiring different kinds of public transport to be made accessible, and introducing concessionary bus fares for the first time, for people with disabilities.  The New Deal for Disabled People pioneers new ways of helping people with disabilities into jobs. The opportunity to work is vital to civil rights; we are testing how best to offer help with rehabilitation and job retention. We will invest an additional £40 million to help people with disabilities into work, ensure that it is worthwhile to try out a job and stay in work if they have high care costs, and improve assessment for equipment and services as people move in and out of work.  We will not use disability benefits to disguise unemployment  the Tory approach in the 1980s. The number of people getting Incapacity Benefit (IB) has fallen by 11 per cent since 1997; but too many people are written off when in fact they could, with support, work.  We will help break down the barriers that keep people with disabilities out of work. We will continue to modernise the operation of the benefits system so that, if people can work, we help them to do so, and stop them slipping from lack of work to inability to work. Around 18 million working days are lost each year due to work-related illness  at a cost of over £17 billion. Many people on Industrial Injuries Benefit are helped into work by combining support with effective services, and we want to help as many of the rest as possible. But if people cannot work society has a duty to provide security for them.  For people unable to take up paid work, we are committed to offer security. We have increased support for children with parents on income support by 80 per cent in real terms since 1997. There is now a minimum income guarantee of £142 per week for people with disabilities under 60. Incapacity Benefit has been extended to people disabled from a young age. Disability Living Allowance has been extended to three- and four-year-olds. We will continue to keep the system under review.  Housing benefit.  Although the number of people claiming housing benefit is currently falling, it remains the main way in which accommodation is made affordable. Our first priority has been to work with local authorities to drive up administrative standards and tackle fraud and error. But we must continue to reform it. So we will simplify housing benefit and its administration, distinguishing between people of working age and pensioners, reforming provision for private tenants, and examining the case for longer awards. We will spread best practice in administration. In the longer term, we will build on our restructuring of rents to ensure that for people of working age, housing benefit as well as the Working Families Tax Credit strengthen work incentives.  Strong and stable family life offers the best possible start to children. And marriage provides a strong foundation for stable relationships. The government supports marriage. But it has to do more than that. It must support families, above all families with children. Our vision of the tax and benefits system for families with children is to provide help for all families; to give most help at the time families need it most; and to give more help to those families most in need.  The Conservatives stacked the tax system against families: over four million children lived in poverty; one in five children were growing up in households without work; the average income of households with children had fallen to 30 per cent below the level for those without children.  Labour has started to turn this round. We have raised child benefit for the first child by over a quarter. The Working Families Tax Credit has meant a tax cut averaging £31 per week for 1.1 million families. In 2001-02, an average of nearly £500 above 1997-98 levels will be invested in every child in Britain. Personal tax and benefit changes have made families with children an average of £1,000 a year better off.  We are pledged to go further  to eradicate child poverty in a generation and halve it by 2010. In the next Parliament we will make major changes. The Childrens Tax Credit  the family tax cut  is worth up to £520 a year for five million families, with half a million families removed from paying tax altogether. It is paid until one parent earns more than £40,000 per year.  From 2003, the Integrated Child Credit will bring together all existing income-related payments for children, providing most help to the neediest children, building on the foundation of universal child benefit. With the new system of child support, every family will receive at least £15 per week, and those most in need £50 per week  over £2,500 per year.  For the first time, Britain will have a seamless system of child support, whether parents are in or out of work, paid to the main carer.  Our aim is to make the goal of ending child poverty in Britain a political litmus test for any political party running for office. The task for the next Parliament is to help another million children out of poverty.  Assets.  Our active welfare state has so far been based on work, finance and services. It is now time to add a fourth pillar to the welfare state  a programme to extend to all children the advantages that come from reaching adulthood backed by a financial nest-egg.  Nearly a third of individuals have no financial savings or assets at all. People without assets are much more likely to have lower earnings and higher unemployment, and are less likely to start a business or enter higher education.  The government already encourages people to save for a rainy day and save for a pension. We are determined to extend the savings habit to more people. But we are pledged also to use saving to promote opportunity for the next generation.  All newly born children will have an interestbearing Child Trust Fund set up in their name with an initial endowment from the government, with more for poorer children. The endowment will be locked until the child reaches adulthood.  We will provide incentives for extended family and friends as well as parents to contribute to the fund. All the next generation will have the backing of a real financial asset to invest in learning, buying a home or setting up a business.  Caring for children.  A safe childhood is not just about financial security. It is also about care for children, especially the 58,000 children in care. Society is failing these children: 70 per cent leave school without any GCSEs and too many have been abused while in care.  Labour supports a national childrens rights director to act as a champion for children in  need and we will consult on whether to develop and extend the directors role. The Criminal Records Bureau will help stop paedophiles and others who are a danger to children from working with them. From next year, all childrens homes will, for the first time, be subject to independent spot checks. The level of educational attainment of children in care will be significantly increased. Every child leaving care will be guaranteed access to a job, training or education.  For many children in care, adoption offers the best chance of success in life. We will make adoption faster and fairer. Children who need new families will be placed within 12 months by 2004. We aim to ensure that at least 1,000 more children a year are adopted, with improved post-adoption support for parents.  Family-friendly working.  For the majority of parents, time is precious.  Many employers offer excellent schemes for family-friendly working. But we want to go further  with government funding to help parents devote more time to their children early in life. We want government to promote choice because, without our help, many people are denied the choices that should be theirs.  A flexible labour market must work to the benefit of both employers and employees.  Statutory maternity leave is currently 18 weeks; we propose to increase it to six months. Statutory maternity pay is paid at a flat rate of £60 a week; we propose to increase it to £100 per week, as big an increase in the next two years as in the past 40 years. Fathers currently have no legal right to paid time off on the birth of a child; we propose to introduce it for two weeks, also paid at £100 per week.  We need to do more to help parents balance work and family. Many parents, especially mothers, want to work reduced hours when they do go back to work. We will work with business and employees to combine flexible working with the needs of business.  Child Support Agency.  Some families break up. Governments role is to ensure that both parents retain responsibility for the financial support of their children where they are able to do so. We have always supported the principle underlying the work of the Child Support Agency (CSA), but the Conservatives bungled its introduction. That is why we have already legislated to reform the CSA and these improvements will come on stream from 2002. A simple system will ensure a better deal for children, that fathers pay a fair share, that mothers benefit from their doing so, and that tougher action is taken against parents who do not comply.  In 1997 Labour made a clear commitment to ensure pensioners share fairly in the rising prosperity of the nation. At this election, we repeat our commitment to pensioners  we honour your lifetime of work by ensuring that you share fairly in the nations rising prosperity, and are committed to tackling pensioner poverty. We will build a secure system on the foundation of the basic state pension.  As a result of Labours policies, in this Parliament spending on pensioners will be £4.5 billion a yearmore in real terms than in 1997. Of this, £2 billion is going to the poorest third of pensioners.  Our first priority was to help those on lowest incomes: we have lifted the incomes of the 1.7 million poorest pensioners by at least £800 a year, and for some couples by up to £1,400.  Pensioner households are on average £11 per week better off than they were in 1997; and over three million pensioner households benefit from free TV licences for those over-75s.  The pensioners tax allowance means six out of ten pensioners pay no tax. We have halved the rate of tax they pay on savings income.We have pledged to extend tax allowances further so that by 2003 no pensioner pays tax until their income reaches £127 per week.  We now need to go further. With Labour, the basic state pension will rise by 2003 to £77 a week for a single pensioner and £123 a week for a pensioner couple. We guarantee that the Minimum Income Guarantee will be uprated each year in line with earnings, throughout the next Parliament. In 2003, this will mean no single pensioner will have an income below £100 per week and no pensioner couple an income below £154 per week. Labour introduced the Winter Fuel Payment. Its level is set each year. Last winter it was raised to £200. For next winter it will also be £200. We will also do more to reward pensioners who have saved. Pensioners who work and save will find, for the first time ever, the government rewarding their saving. Pensioner couples with an income up to £200 per week and single pensioners with income up to £135 per week will be rewarded for saving  the government adding up to 60p for each £1 of savings income up to a maximum of £23. In the process, we will abolish the weekly means test for pensioners, along with removing the unfair test of savings, which penalises pensioners who have modest savings and whose thrift should be recognised.  It is also vital to have in place long-term pension reform. We support a fair balance of public and private provision. Occupational and personal pensions, properly regulated, will continue to offer security for middle and high earners. We will continue discussions on annuity reform to ensure tax rules do not unnecessarily restrict the development of annuity products and markets. For low- to middle-income earners, stakeholder pensions cap costs, guarantee value for money, offer flexibility, and drive down fees across the board. And for the lowest paid and carers, full-time parents and people with disabilities, the state second pension will top up their pension contributions to give a decent pension in retirement to 18 million people.  Todays pensioners have much to give to society. Labours NHS Plan offers £1.4 billion of investment for older people to promote better health and support independence. Pensioners also need simple, accessible services that treat them with dignity and promote independence.  We will build on Care Direct to provide a better integration of health, housing, benefits and social care for older people. This will be an integrated third age service to help older people and those who care for them.  Carers.  Not only are the large majority of people who require care older, but also the majority of carers are older people. Labour will tackle the problems faced by people requiring care and the problems of carers themselves.  The national carers strategy is the first step, with information, support and care for carers: Labour will spend £500 million over the next three years providing financial support for 300,000 carers through the benefits system, and £255 million for social care services for carers. More is being done for carers through income support; carers will be better able to combine work and care; and 75,000 more carers each year are now able to take a break.  Investing in the future new babies to get our Child Trust Fund Skills for life a young catering student works towards a vocational qualification from their caring responsibilities. We are proud that, with Labour, care by qualified nurses will be made free to all, wherever it is received. One hundred and fifty thousand more older people will receive rehabilitation and convalescence through growing investment in the NHS and social services that the Tories refuse to match.  We want to see carers given access to the cash and services appropriate to their service to their relatives and the community. The Carers and Disabled Childrens Act gives carers a right to an independent assessment of their needs. We will examine the development of a fund to help local authorities produce tailored care packages to back up the results of these assessments.  Social exclusion, affecting around ten per cent of the population, living in fewer than 1,000 of the most deprived wards in Britain, damages lives and wrecks communities. Before 1997, social exclusion was ignored. Now we have a new approach  improving the quality of mainstream services, preventing people falling between the cracks, and reintegrating them into society if things go wrong. We have targeted five priorities: Homelessness The number of people living on the streets is down by one third since 1997. Labours target is to cut rough sleeping to two-thirds of its 1998 level by 2002. Beyond then, we will maintain the drive to keep the number as low as possible.  Teenage pregnancy rates are falling Yet Britain has the highest rates in Europe.  Labours strategy tackles the causes of teenage pregnancy, provides mothers under 18 with access to supervised housing if they cannot live at home, and ensures that, if they do have children, teenagers get access to training, education or work. By 2004 we are pledged to reduce teenage pregnancy by 15 per cent.  Truancy and exclusion.  Labour has a target of reducing truancy and exclusion by a third by 2002. The police are conducting truancy sweeps; parents are now subject to fines of up to £2,500; funds are being targeted towards pupils at risk.  16- to 18-year-olds.  Nearly ten per cent of 16- to 18-year-olds are not in education, training or work. The new Connexions service will bridge the gap, providing a single adviser to ensure all young people receive clear advice on the transition to work.  Neighbourhood renewal.  Over the next three years Labour is pledged to back reform, with £900 million of investment in deprived neighbourhoods. We want local people to lead renewal  a coalition of public, private and voluntary organisations specifying priorities, engaging local effort. Local Strategic Partnerships, which we have introduced to help coordinate public service improvement, will be properly inclusive of local people, involving them in decision-making. They will be backed by specific funds to engage the local community.  Nearly £100 million has been set aside for business start-ups, and we will create a new tax credit for community investment to create £1 billion of investment in disadvantaged areas.  Labours objective is to get the right benefit to the right people at the right time. We want those entitled to benefits to take up their rights to claim them. Fraud undermines confidence in the welfare system, so we are committed to reduce it.  We have been prepared to be tough  preventing fraud by tightening gateways, sharpening sanctions on fraudsters, and now with two-strikes-and-youre-out. We have saved £1 billion in fraud and error over the course of the Parliament by tightening up the way we administer income support. The introduction of Automated Credit Transfer will save a further £100 million per year.  Labour is committed to clear targets for fraud reduction for each benefit, including a commitment to halve the rate of fraud and error in income support and Job Seekers Allowance by 2006, and to incorporate fraud prevention into the design of new policies on benefits and tax credits. We are also committed to data sharing between government agencies and action to reduce to a minimum the number of spare national insurance numbers that are a gateway to fraud.  Our welfare state is underpinned by clear values  we help you to help yourself, we invest in children, we support our pensioners, we insist that no community be written off, and we minimise fraud and error. Our reforms will build a strong and inclusive society.  Security in retirement state pensions to rise with Labour A popular welfare state One million children lifted out of poverty  Our ten-year goals:  - Halve the burglary rate and double the chance of a persistent offender being caught and punished, as we modernise the criminal justice system.  - Reformed local government with higher-quality services, as we decentralise power.  Our next steps  - An extra 6,000 police recruits raising police numbers to their highest ever level. - Double the amount of assets seized from drug traffickers and other major criminals. - Increased sentences plus education and drug treatment for persistent offenders. - A bill of rights for victims. - New freedoms with new targets for local government.  Peace of mind Labour is pledged to raise police numbers to their highest ever level  4. STRONG AND SAFE COMMUNITIES.  We all know the sort of Britain we want to live in  a Britain where we can walk the streets safely and know our children are safe. We have a ten-year vision: a new social contract where everyone has a stake based on equal rights, where they pay their dues by exercising responsibility in return, and where local communities shape their own futures.  Overall crime is down ten per cent in Labour Britain, recorded crime down seven per cent, and police numbers are now rising.  Our strategy is clear and consistent  tough on crime and tough on the causes of crime.  Our ten-year goal of reducing crime depends on reform of the criminal justice system at every level, from police to courts to prison  to put crime reduction centre stage. And, because crime is changing, crime fighting has to change too  to tackle repeat offending, drug-related crime and organised crime. We are investing to raise police numbers to their highest level ever.  Offenders must know they will be supervised in or out of prison until they can prove they have gone straight.  Safe communities reclaim their streets; then they can shape their own affairs. In the 19th century, local politics was the motor for economic and social change. Our purpose is simple: to create a Britain that is democratic, decentralised and diverse, with decisions always taken as close to the people as is consistent with efficiency and equity. Our ten-year goal is a new settlement with local government  over finance, structures and services. Recorded crime doubled under the Conservatives: burglary went up 105 per cent, car crime 110 per cent, violent crime 182 per cent. The number of offenders caught, convicted and punished fell. The criminal justice system, especially for young offenders, was in disarray. Anti-social behaviour was unchecked.  And investment was falling.  The British Crime Survey shows crime down ten per cent in Labours first two and a half years, including a four per cent drop in violent crime.  Recorded crime is down seven per cent from 1997, domestic burglary down 28 per cent, car crime down 20 per cent. Investment in crime fighting is up. We have reversed the declining trend in police numbers, reformed youth justice, and supported every community to prevent crime and anti-social behaviour. We have reduced by seven weeks the time from arrest to sentence for persistent young offenders, and are on track to meet our pledge to halve the time by May 2002.  But we are not satisfied. Drug-related crime is a menace. Recorded violent crime has risen, partly because more domestic and racial violence is being reported. And new crimes are being committed  fraud through the internet, human trafficking.  The only way to reduce crime is by being tough on crime and tough on its causes. Government can help families and communities prevent crime. But when people do commit crimes, we need an effective criminal justice system able to catch, punish and rehabilitate people.2  Supporting the police.  The foundation is our police force. Police numbers started falling in 1993. Our investment in 2000-01 increased the number of recruits by an extra 3,000, boosting the number of officers in training by 77 per cent over the previous year.  Now Labour pledges a further 6,000 extra recruits. Labours pledge is that over the next three years annual funding for the police will rise by £1.6 billion, to £9.3 billion.  We also need to create a more effective police service. Basic command units are the heart of modern policing, and local commanders and senior detectives should be properly trained and rewarded. Strong leadership, modern equipment and specialist training and expertise are all essential. We will bring in new arrangements for the development and appointment of chief officers. We will introduce a new national core curriculum for officers at every level. We will ensure that specialist detective expertise is built up using outside experts where necessary.  Labour will ensure more people see more police in the community. We will discuss with the police how those on the frontline might be rewarded for their skills, experience and commitment. We will promote co-operation across force boundaries for common services like training. We are also committed to a new independent police complaints commission.  Persistent offending.  About 100,000 persistent offenders, mostly young men, commit about half of all serious crimes. We need a new approach to catch, convict, punish and rehabilitate more of them:   Youth offending teams will track up to 2,500 of the most persistent young offenders 24 hours a day, seven days a week.   Every active offender will be on the DNA database by 2004.   Persistent offending should lead to increased punishment. We will end the failed policy of repeat financial penalties; where offending continues, firmer measures will be taken. We will invest over £200 million over three years to reduce reoffending by those in custody.  Sentences will combine time in prison and in the community, with proper supervision after release for ex-prisoners. In time, all offenders will have their own plan for return to lawful life, starting in custody with drug treatment or literacy training.   New Review Courts will ensure that offenders who breach the conditions of their sentence will get extra community service, more intensive supervision or custody. Those who break their bail can expect to go straight into custody for the remainder of their remand period.   To deal with the most dangerous offenders of all  those with a dangerous severe personality disorder  we will pass new legislation and create over 300 more high-security prison and hospital places.  Our proposals are based on a simple principle: stay straight or you will stay supervised or go back inside. The continued modernisation of the probation, parole and prison services, so every offender gets punishment designed to minimise reoffending, will carry this forward. We will build on our youth justice reforms to improve the standard of custodial accommodation and offending programmes for 18- to 20-year-old offenders.  Crime in the community.  Broken windows, graffiti and litter all send a signal about lawlessness. Labour supports fines for anti-social behaviour and new powers to tackle unruly behaviour and kerb crawlers.  Every local authority should have an anti-social behaviour unit. We will tackle alcohol-related disorder, with an overhaul of licensing laws, greater flexibility over opening times, and tougher controls on rogue landlords. We will also streamline the system for removal of untaxed and abandoned cars.  Crime fighting now starts in every community thanks to new statutory Crime and Disorder Partnerships. Our Safe Communities Fund will target hundreds of neighbourhoods with the highest crime rates with extra crime-fighting investment. Domestic violence accounts for at least a quarter of all violent crime, so Labour is committed to expanding the safe hostel network.  Crime prevention requires that those most at risk of falling into a life of crime  children excluded from school, teenagers leaving care  are given real help and opportunity. That includes drugs education for every child at primary and secondary school, and youth inclusion schemes in high-crime areas. We will also take measures to tackle the problem of child pornography on the internet.  Drugs.  One of the biggest contemporary drivers of crime is drugs. Access to effective treatment is essential. Prisoners are already subject to compulsory testing and offered treatment where necessary, which has led to a 50 per cent cut in the number testing positive. Drug Testing and Treatment Orders ensure people punished in the community stay drug-free.  We are pledged to raise spending on drug treatment by 70 per cent by 2004. We will roll out drug testing to cover offenders at every stage of the system. People in prison for drugrelated offences will have to kick the habit before they are free from supervision on the outside. Drug dealers will be required to register with the police after leaving prison.  We will simplify the law on extradition to target organised crime including drug traffickers. The Criminal Assets Recovery Agency will target their ill-gotten gains. We will follow the money trail, through bureaux de change to offshore accounts, to convict them, and remove their money and passports.  Our ambition is to mobilise every neighbourhood against drugs. We will therefore ensure that crime-fighting partnerships, covering every locality, get over £200 million over the next three years to fight crime and drugs.  A modern criminal justice system.  The UKs legal traditions are precious. But too much of our criminal law and the organisation of the courts are stuck in the past. Our ambition is to re-equip the criminal justice system to deliver justice for all  the victims, the public and the defendant, with a short-term target of 100,000 more crimes ending in a criminal brought to justice. Our White Paper Criminal Justice: The Way Ahead set out our initial views on reform. The Auld enquiry will also make major recommendations.  Prosecution.  Despite an increase of 25 per cent since 1997, we have too few prosecutors. By 2004, Labour pledges 300 new prosecutors, including specialists in areas like serious and organised crime, paid on a level playing field with the defence. We will modernise and consolidate the whole criminal law system to promote public confidence and to speed up criminal proceedings.  Law reform is necessary to make provisions against corporate manslaughter.  Courts.  The current system, split between magistrates and crown courts, needs reform. A unified system, including lower or intermediate tiers of court, offers simplicity and flexibility. Lay magistrates as well as professional judges have their place in the system. We will remove the widely abused right of defendants alone to dictate whether or not they should be tried in crown court. For specialist cases such as those involving domestic violence or fraud, there is a strong case for specialist courts and specialist judges. We will also develop late sitting, sevenday- a-week courts in high-crime areas to ensure there is no delay in getting people through the criminal justice system. We have established a Judicial Commissioner to scrutinise the appointments process, and will take forward reform on the basis of experience.  Rules of evidence.  Our rules of evidence fail to trust the good sense of judges and jurors. Recent case law has extended the admissibility of evidence of previous conduct. If there is any remaining doubt, we will consider legislation to reinforce the judgment. Pending the findings of the Auld report, we see a strong case for a new presumption that would allow evidence of previous convictions where relevant. Currently only the prosecution must disclose all expert evidence and names of all witnesses. In the light of the Auld report, we will consider whether the defence should do so too. In addition, witnesses should be able to refer to their original statements in the witness box, as well as offer evidence by video-link.  Representation.  We have created the Community Legal Service and will extend it to 90 per cent of the population by April 2002. We will continue to pursue the principle of best value for the benefit of the taxpayer and criminal defendants in the Criminal Defence Service. We will examine reforms of the tribunal system in the light of the Leggatt Review. We will subject restrictive practices in the legal professions to the closest scrutiny to ensure both the professions and the courts serve the wider public interest.  Victims have rights.  In 1997, victims were the forgotten people in legal battles. That has begun to change. We have more than doubled the funding for Victim Support, taken powers to protect vulnerable witnesses in court, and prevented personal cross-examination by the defendant of rape victims. We now propose further action. First, victims will be given the legal right to present their views on the impact of the crime to the court and other criminal justice agencies before sentencing decisions. Second, prosecutors will be able to challenge defence pleas in mitigation of the crime. Third, we will legislate for a Victims Bill of Rights to give support, protection, and rights to information and compensation to victims.  Labour believes that Britain can be a model of a multicultural, multi-racial society. We have made major legal change; now is the time to build the inclusive society in tune with British values.  Our commitment to protection for every citizen is expressed in the 1998 Human Rights Act. It ensures that British citizens are able to enforce rights in our own courts. Other legal change was necessary too. The Race Relations (Amendment) Act learns the legal lessons from the shocking death of Stephen Lawrence and places a positive duty on all public bodies to promote equal opportunity. We abhor racism and shall continue to implement the recommendations of the Macpherson report, including the reform of the double jeopardy law for murder. The repeal of Section 28 of the 1988 Local Government Act was grossly misrepresented as an attempt to use teaching to promote particular lifestyles. We will ensure that such teaching continues to be prohibited, based on the provisions of the Learning and Skills Act, while removing discrimination on grounds of sexual orientation.  The UK now has the most comprehensive anti-discrimination legislation in Europe. But an inclusive, tolerant, open society, where people rise on their merits, depends on culture and action as well as law.  We now need to reduce the barriers  to services, opportunities, institutions  that still hold people back. This applies in the public and private sectors. There are too few black and Asian staff in key public services and, in almost all organisations, far too few in middle and senior grades. This is why we now have targets for the diversity of central government and other public services.  Voluntary and community organisations are key to Labours vision for Britain. From large national charities to local community groups and faith-based institutions, these sectors are a vital and diverse part of national life. We have changed the tax rules to encourage individuals and businesses to give to charity, supported initiatives to increase volunteering, involved voluntary and community groups in the design and delivery of key government programmes like Sure Start, and helped charities build up their capacity to do their job even better.  However, in other parts of the country there may be a stronger sense of regional identity and a desire for a regional political voice.  In 1997 we said that provision should be made for directly elected regional government to go ahead in regions where people decided in a referendum to support it and where predominantly unitary local government is established. This remains our commitment.  The nations of the UK.  Devolution has strengthened the UK, preserving the union on the basis of a fairer partnership.  The nationalist lie has also been exposed: the UK is strong enough and flexible enough to devolve power while retaining the benefits of staying together.  The Scottish Parliament and the Welsh Assembly have put power in the hands of local people. In Scotland the Parliament has power over primary legislation. In Wales we will build on the already successful legislative partnership with the Assembly, and continue to enact specific legislation for Wales, where appropriate.  The UK Parliament makes the essential financial allocations to all devolved bodies.  English MPs make up 85 per cent of the UK Parliament so there is no case for threatening the unity of the UK with an English Parliament or the denial of voting rights to Scottish, Welsh and Northern Irelands MPs at Westminster.  Northern Ireland.  We have made working for peace in Northern Ireland a priority. The Good Friday Agreement was overwhelmingly supported by the people of Northern Ireland and in the Republic of Ireland.  While it has not brought a perfect peace, and while the peace process has not been smooth, it has made life immeasurably better.  Northern Ireland now has its own Assembly and Executive. They have produced their first programme for government and first budget on a cross-community basis. The security situation has been transformed. People can walk again on the streets of Belfast free from fear. Troops no longer patrol in most of the province. And the number of murders has been drastically reduced.  We will build on these foundations to ensure that the Good Friday Agreement is implemented in full and the new institutions take root. We will establish a modern, responsive and fully accountable police service properly representative of the two main traditions in Northern Ireland and enjoying their trust and support. And we will bring about the key reforms in the civil and criminal justice system which secure the respect and trust of both traditions.  Parliamentary reform.  The House of Commons is now more representative than ever before, yet only one in five MPs is a woman. Labour increased womens representation five-fold in the 1997 Parliament through all-women shortlists. We are committed, through legislation, to allow each party to make positive moves to increase the representation of women. Labour will continue to modernise the procedures of the House of Commons so it can effectively fulfil its functions of representation and scrutiny.  The government has introduced major innovations in the electoral systems used in the UK  for the devolved administrations, the European Parliament, and the London Assembly. The Independent Commission on the Voting System made proposals for electoral reform at Westminster. We will review the experience of the new systems and the Jenkins report to assess whether changes might be made to the electoral system for the House of Commons. A referendum remains the right way to agree any change for Westminster.  We are committed to completing House of Lords reform, including removal of the remaining hereditary peers, to make it more representative and democratic, while maintaining the House of Commons traditional primacy. We have given our support to the report and conclusions of the Wakeham Commission, and will seek to implement them in the most effective way possible. Labour supports modernisation of the House of Lords procedures to improve its effectiveness.  We will put the independent Appointments Commission on a statutory footing.  Whitehall.  Our civil service is world-renowned for its independence. Labour is committed to maintaining the political impartiality of the civil service. But it needs reform to make it more effective and more entrepreneurial. There have been important reforms already. We want to take further radical steps to ensure the civil service has the skills base necessary to meet the challenges set out in this manifesto.  Equal rights for all, proper enforcement of the law, and reformed structures of self-government: these are the foundations of a strong civic society.  Labour offers opportunity with responsibility  the right combination for Britain in the 21st century.  Labour will build on its Compact with the voluntary sector, as we develop more farreaching partnerships for the delivery of services and the renewal of our communities.  We will also build on our financial incentives for volunteering, by developing an effective infrastructure to support voluntary work in every community in Britain. We welcome the contribution of churches and other faith-based organisations as partners of local and central government in community renewal. We will use a successor to the Lambeth Group to look at governments interface with faith communities.  Immigration.  People from abroad make a positive contribution to British society. As our economy changes and expands, so our rules on immigration need to reflect the need to meet skills shortages. The primary purpose rule, which split families and did nothing to stop abuse, has been ended. A right of appeal for family visitors has been introduced.  immigration rules will remain clear, firm and fair, and help ensure that those who come and work here continue to make a major contribution to our economic and social life.  Asylum.  It is right that people fleeing persecution are able to make a new life as hard-working citizens in a new country. Britain has a long record of providing a home for such people, and it is important that we maintain this position. But asylum should not be an alternative route to immigration.  The UK is ninth per head of population among European nations for asylum applications. The key is to hear cases swiftly as well as fairly. By cutting the decision time and increasing the processing of claims to over 10,000 a month, Labour has reduced the backlog we inherited.  We have tightened controls against traffickers, and introduced a civil penalty for lorry drivers who bring in illegal immigrants. A national support system has been introduced to relieve pressure on local authorities. Asylum seekers and their dependants whose claims are rejected will be removed from Britain with the aim of more than 30,000 in 2003-04. We will also help those granted refugee status to integrate into the local community, supporting them so they can come off benefits and into work.  We support tough penalties for those who engage in the barbaric trade of human trafficking. We will bring forward proposals to ensure a common interpretation of the 1951 Convention across the EU and to improve the international response to regional crises.  Change comes from the bottom up as much as the top down. For the last 50 years, governments have failed to respect this basic truth.  Local authorities are responsible for the effective delivery of over £90 billion of public services a year. The staff and councillors who work for the community often have the hardest jobs and their expertise is a real resource when it comes to achieving reform. The best of local government is an inspiring example of what government can achieve.  Labours ambition is a partnership of mutual respect and mutual responsibility. We want to combine additional rights and resources with responsibility and reform, working with councillors and officers to develop the structures, services and finance to help local communities.  The job of local government is to provide the leadership to improve quality of life, and offer the citizen a seamless, one-stop service. We have worked with local government to establish clear targets for standards of service; and to offer incentives for service improvement and innovation. Partnership with the voluntary and private sectors is key.  The foundation of effective service delivery is best value in every service. Year on year, local authorities and their staff will now work to achieve improvement in services, matching themselves against the best. Citizens need a voice  we will work with local government to ensure that citizens needs are the driving force in the procurement and delivery of local services.  Electronic service delivery offers the prospect of greater convenience, access and quality, and we have set demanding targets for its use.  When public services are delivered in partnership with the private and voluntary sectors, this should be on the basis of best value not worst labour standards. The TUPE regulations protect the rights of any transferred employees. Newly hired workers are protected by minimum standards at work. We will use a wide-ranging review of TUPE regulations to consider whether unfair disparities are being created between these two groups of workers.  We want to give successful local councils more leeway to meet local needs using a £400 million reward fund. We have piloted local public service agreements to offer new investment and greater financial flexibility in return for higher performance.  We will extend this reform to all upper-tier councils.  We will offer further flexibility for high-performance authorities, with reformed inspections and more local discretion to encourage civic renewal. We consulted last year on a range of reforms aimed at enabling councils to deliver key local services on the basis of transparent, stable and adequate funding. These remain our aims. We will give new freedoms to local authorities to enable them to invest in local capital projects.  Labour believes that local quality of life issues  from litter to parks  are vital issues, not peripheral. We will pilot home zones, redesigning local areas to enhance safety and the quality of the local neighbourhood. Local authorities should have the incentive and means to improve the local environment by recycling local fines into a local environment fund.  Our ambition is the development of active, intouch local government, serving the people. We support the introduction of elected mayors for our cities, which is why every local council now has the power to ballot citizens for a mayor.  Regional government.  Some functions are best tackled at the regional level. Economic development is the core of regional policy today. In our first term, we have created RDAs to drive regional economic development. Regional chambers have been set up to provide some accountability for regional economic decision-making.  We are committed, as RDAs take on more power, to enhance the scrutiny functions of regional chambers. For some regions this degree  Multicultural Britain an inclusive society begins at school Towards peace in Northern Ireland Tony Blair with David Trimble and Seamus Mallon Political renewal Global responsibility Labour is increasing funding for our armed forces Our ten-year goals  Europe to have the most competitive knowledge-based economies in the world, as British ideas lead a reformed and enlarged Europe.  Delivering Kyoto and international development targets, as we help tackle climate change and global poverty.  Our next steps:  - Lead economic reform in Europe Work for the re-start of world trade Talks.  - Strong, effective and responsive armed forces.  - Raise international aid towards the UN target.  - Be the first country to introduce greenhouse gas trading to cut pollution.  5. BRITAIN STRONG IN THE WORLD.  Britain needs a government ready to stand up for our interests and values. We have a ten-year vision for British foreign policy: a leading player in Europe, our alliance with the USA strengthened, using our global connections to help Britain and tackle global problems.  Unlike the Conservatives, we see Europe as an opportunity not a threat. Because we participate fully, we are able to work with our partners to shape an EU agenda that advances our national interests. We will put democratically elected national governments in the driving seat of EU policy. Our ten-year goal is to work with our partners for Europe to have the most competitive knowledge-based economies in the world. We hold to our promise: no membership of the single currency without the consent of the British people in a referendum.  Britain has some of the best armed forces in the world. With Labour, they are being developed to meet the challenges of the post-Cold War world.  Labour is committed to lead the development of a comprehensive agenda for poverty reduction and sustainable development.  We want to mobilise the international community to deliver the International Development Targets, generate growth and equity in developing countries, and help them benefit from global economic integration.  We are convinced of the science of global warming. We pledge to meet tough national targets for environmental protection, and we will work at international level to halt and reverse climate change.  We face a choice between an inward-looking chauvinism that leads to isolation and a modern patriotism where the British national interest is pursued through international engagement.  Europe is changing. Economic reform is under way in the European Union, with over two million new jobs created last year. Many new members are going to join the EU. Co-operation is being extended in defence and security policy. A new way of conducting EU business has been born  comparing best practice to share the benefits of diversity in order to reduce over-reliance on centralised regulation.  We face a very simple question. Do we want to be part of the change, influencing its direction? Or do we want to opt out? We have spent 50 years on the margins; it is time to make the most of our membership.  We have seen the alternative. By 1997 Britain had retreated into itself: business was global, people travelled and worked around the world, our culture was open to new ideas, yet our government was closing itself off. And Britain got a worse deal. Because they were backward looking and divided on Europe, the Conservatives were weak and ineffective in Europe. And because of their weakness in Europe, Britain lost influence around the world. We lost our say over decisions that affected our lives.  In the last four years we have seen the benefits of engagement. Our rebate has been protected and our contributions are falling to similar levels as France and Italy. The Labour model of defence co-operation  giving Europe the option to act where NATO chooses not to  has won through. Economic reform is now helping the European economy. The veto on crucial issues of national sovereignty, such as tax, is safe. All this happened only because Labour had the strength to get involved, argue for its ideas, and persuade others to follow us.  Labour believes that Europe brings benefits for Britain, and a Europe reformed by British ideas, working with our MEPs, will be even better for Britain. Together with virtually all other European countries we do not support a United States of Europe. But we do believe a Europe made up of nation states and offering a unique blend of inter-governmental co-operation where possible and integration where necessary, can be a major force for good  for its own members and in the wider world.  We want to take Europe forward, to meet British needs.  A Europe of prosperity.  Europe is a crucial market, accounting for more than half of our trade. Britain has secured a shift in economic policy in Europe  away from harmonisation of rules and towards a system based on dynamic markets allied to comparison and promotion of best practice.  The key priorities are: to deliver more choice and lower prices through liberalisation of financial services and utilities; to promote business development with a common EU patent and cuts in red tape; to develop our common research effort in frontier technologies like bioscience; to cut delays and fares by establishing an integrated Air Traffic Control system for Europe; and to develop effective labour market policy to tackle unemployment in dialogue with the social partners.  We support efforts being made across the EU to reform welfare states, modernise social partnership and advance social inclusion. EU state aid policy should bear down on aids that distort the single market while supporting economic modernisation. We will keep the veto on vital matters of national sovereignty, such as tax and border controls.  Trade has been a vital source of prosperity for Europes citizens. Our vision is of an open European economy. That requires a genuine single market, in an open world trading system.  A wider Europe.  New countries joining the EU will give Britain a bigger market and Europe a bigger voice.  Membership will help guarantee the freedoms of the new democracies in central and eastern Europe. Labour is pledged to do all it can to enable the first group of applicant countries to join in time to take part in the next European Parliamentary elections in 2004.  It is vital we ratify the Treaty of Nice which is essential to enlargement; Labour in government will do so. The Conservatives have said they will insist on tr ying to renegotiate Europes treaties at the first summit after the election.  No other country agrees with this. That means that a Conservative government would either have to back down in the face of opposition, or take Britain out of Europe altogether with disastrous consequences for Britain.  Our argument is that if Britain is stronger in Europe, it will be stronger in the rest of the world. We reject the view of those who say we must choose between Europe and the USA.  We shall remain the USAs firm ally and friend; but we are not going to turn our backs on Europe. The USA and Europe account for ten per cent of world population but 60 per cent of global GDP; working together we can tackle many problems and spread the benefits of freedom, peace and prosperity.  A Europe of the future  The main sources of popular legitimacy in Europe remain national governments and parliaments. So national governments should be seen to be setting the agenda of the EU, with the European Council setting the EUs priorities, a strong independent Commission ensuring that the European interest is heard and enforced, and an effective European Parliament improving draft legislation and holding the Commission to account.  Labour wants the next Inter-governmental Conference in 2004 to address public concerns about the way the EU works, spelling out in a clear statement of principles what should and should not be done at European level. Labour supports a stronger role for national parliaments in European affairs, for example in a second chamber of the European Parliament, with a particular remit to oversee the division of competences. We will also insist that the Commission completes its internal reform programme.  Britains national security is based on the mutual support that comes from membership of NATO. That will not change. And although Britain has rarely been more secure from foreign invasion, there are new threats to our people from crime and terrorism. Instability around the world can affect us directly and we have a global responsibility to play our part in reducing international conflict, controlling the spread of weapons of mass destruction, and contributing to international peace-keeping and peace-making operations.  To enable the European Union to act where NATO chooses not to, the EU should improve its military capabilities for humanitarian, peace-keeping and crisis management tasks.  Our armed forces are the best in the world at fighting if they have to, and keeping the peace where they can. Labour is committed to investing more in real terms in our armed services over the next three years, the first year-on-year real increase in funds for over a decade. An important part of that investment will be in better service accommodation. We are determined to recruit and retain the best people, from all walks of life and all backgrounds.  We will look after the interests of Britains veterans. We have doubled funding for research on Gulf War illnesses, and will continue this important work.  In 1997 Labour promised a strategic defence review. Today, that review is admired around the world for its clarity, efficiency and foresight. We need more mobile and more flexible armed forces, with the ability to project force at distance and speed, to work closely with other nations and international bodies, and to fight and keep the peace. We have shown what this means in practice in Kosovo and Sierra Leone, and our servicemen and women have responded magnificently. We are determined to maximise resources for frontline use by disposing of surplus spares and promoting smart procurement and efficiency savings.  The European Defence Initiative is an important part of our defence policy. Europe spends two-thirds as much as the US on defence, but gets only a fraction of its effectiveness. European nations need to modernise their armed forces for rapid and flexible deployment. Improved EU military capabilities will not be separate from NATO structures and would only be deployed where NATO as a whole chooses not to engage. The launch of an EU operation will follow a unanimous decision, with each member state free to decide whether to take part.  We support Trident, Britains minimum nuclear deterrent. The Nuclear Non- Proliferation Treaty commits us to work for the global elimination of nuclear weapons. We are enthusiastic signatories to the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, whose coming into force will impede nuclear proliferation, and we want to see the USA and Russia continue to reduce their nuclear stockpiles.  We recognise the new dangers posed by the proliferation of nuclear, chemical and biological weapons, and the need to combat them. Nuclear arms reductions and proliferation controls remain an important part of defence and security policy. We will seek effective inspections against the development of chemical and biological weapons. We will encourage the US to consult closely with NATO allies on its ideas for missile defence, and to pursue dialogue with Russia on a new framework for strategic arms control that will encourage further cuts in nuclear weapons.  The British defence industry is a vital part of our economy, sustaining some 350,000 hightechnology jobs. We will continue to work closely with our best companies to get the best equipment for our armed forces  a good deal for the taxpayer as well as a secure future for high-technology jobs.  The UK has introduced the most open report on arms exports of any European nation and has led the EU to adopt a code of conduct on arms sales. Labour will lead efforts to control the trade in small arms, and work for a comprehensive action plan at this years UN conference on small arms, including an international arms surrender fund to provide development aid in exchange for firearms. We will legislate to modernise the regulation of arms exports, with a licensing system to control the activities of arms brokers and traffickers wherever they are located. We will work with EU applicant countries to strengthen their capacity to control legal and illicit arms transfers.  Britain belongs to a unique range of influential global organisations, giving us responsibilities and opportunities. Labour will stand up for Britain.   At the UN, where we support a more modern and representative Security Council, with more effective peace-keeping.   At the Group of 7 leading industrialised countries, where we will stay at the forefront of efforts to promote development.   In the Commonwealth, where we will work to promote human rights and bridge the digital divide.  We will argue for an early, comprehensive world trade round, to the benefit of industrialised and developing countries alike.  The World Trade Organisation must be reformed, not rejected. We will support fairer terms of trade for developing countries, and a reduction in protectionism in the developed world in areas such as agriculture. We will continue to help developing countries exercise their rights within the WTO.  We support the promotion of higher labour standards around the world, as well as respect for the environment, as we expand world trade.  The International Labour Organisation (ILO) is the place to set labour standards, but we believe there should be closer co-operation between the ILO and WTO through the creation of a joint standing forum of the two organisations.  We are committed to encouraging universal observance of human rights. Governments that are democratically elected will be firmer allies for peace; open societies that respect individual freedom will be more reliable trade partners. Labour will be a friend of those denied human rights and a supporter of steps to strengthen them.  Labour has played a leading role in bringing war criminals, notably from former Yugoslavia, to justice, and in establishing a permanent court to try war crimes. We will work to make the International Criminal Court a reality, with Britain as one of its first members.  Reform in Europe. South Africa next year.  We are one of the few countries to have met our 1992 obligations to hold greenhouse gases in 2000 below their 1990 levels. In 1997 we set a target of reducing CO2 emissions by 20 per cent by 2010. We will meet our obligations arising from the Kyoto protocol and have set out a detailed strategy to achieve more  a 23 per cent cut in greenhouse gases by 2010. The Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution has said the UK will need to cut CO2 production by 60 per cent by 2050, so we need to press ahead with a radical agenda for the development of low carbon economic growth, embodied in our £700 million commitment to renewable energy.  In addition to our proposals for environmental technology and renewable energy described in Prosperity for all, we must also make progress in the following areas:   We must make the market work for the environment. Britain is developing the first national CO2 emissions trading system in the world. It will help companies find the most efficient way of reducing emissions  and reward them for doing so. Once the system is established here we will seek to extend it around the world.   We will support hybrid and fuel cell vehicles, which already offer a halving of fuel consumption and CO2 emissions, with cheaper motoring to match  and for cleaner fuels and biofuels. By increasing demand for new technologies we can boost innovation and the vitality of the UK car industry.   It is imperative that we use natural resources more efficiently and recycle more. We will continue to tax pollution and reward clean production. We will develop environmental productivity indicators. We have set a target for the recycling of 35 per cent of household waste by 2015, and will work with all local authorities to introduce kerbside recycling schemes wherever appropriate.   Water management is a vital challenge for the future  for the environment and for the growing world population. We will continue to make our contribution at home: leakage is down by almost 30 per cent since 1997, bills have been cut by 12 per cent and disconnections have been ended.   Environmental protection and sustainable development go hand in hand. We cannot protect the environment without addressing the development needs of the poor, and poverty reduction depends on safeguarding natural resources on which poor people depend.   We will continue to provide leadership abroad, working for international agreement on climate change, improved integration of the environment in European policies and a strong global environment agency built around the current UN environment programme. We will work to improve marine and forest conservation overseas and in the UK.  Britain can be pivotal to world affairs, using our alliances to advance our interests and values.  The key is to use our strengths of history and geography to engage with other countries, not retreat.  That is Labours promise.  In 1997 Labour pledged to give new priority to tackling global poverty. Four years on, there have been real achievements  a cabinet minister heads an internationally respected department, the aid budget has been substantially raised, and tied aid abolished.  Britain is playing a leading world role on debt relief, education, HIV/AIDS, and in responding to humanitarian disasters. With strong UK leadership, the international development effort is now increasingly focused on poverty reduction.  This is morally right, but also in our interest.  Many of the worlds biggest challenges  from violent conflict to rapid population growth to environmental threat  are caused or exacerbated by global poverty and inequality.  There can be no secure future for any of us unless we promote greater global social justice.  Labour will continue to focus Britains development effort on the achievement of the international development targets by 2015  including halving the proportion of the worlds population living in extreme poverty, reducing child and infant mortality by two-thirds, primary education for all children, and sustainable development plans in every country.  With Labour the aid budget will rise to 0.33 per cent of GNP by 2003-04, reaching £3.6 billion  a 45 per cent increase in real terms since 1997 level. We remain committed to the UN target of 0.7 per cent of national income devoted to development and will make further substantial increases over the next Parliament. We remain committed to our bill, blocked by the Tories, to consolidate our poverty-focused approach to development We are using this aid to support political and economic reform in developing countries. Our aid is an investment to help countries put in place policies to raise the growth rate with greater equity, crack down on corruption, promote human rights, including for women and girls, and develop effective governance and democracy. We will legislate to toughen controls over UK nationals who commit offences of corruption abroad.  Labour will champion increased effectiveness and a stronger focus on poverty reduction within international institutions  particularly the EU, but also the World Bank, IMF, UN and Commonwealth  with full support for poverty reduction strategies where they genuinely prioritise poverty reduction. We are committed to international action to put the needs of children at the centre of these strategies. By 2006 we want to raise to 70 per cent the proportion of EU aid going to low income countries, and work with the Commission, Parliament and other governments to strengthen the EUs development effort.  Labour has led internationally on debt relief, providing 100 per cent relief for countries committed to spending the proceeds on povertyreduction.  We will work to help more of the heavily indebted poor countries qualify for debt relief where this benefits the poor. And we will work to prevent new debt burdens through international agreement not to give export credits for excessive military spending or prestige projects.  Education has a special place for Labour. We will increase further our support for quality primary education for all, particularly for girls.  Our Imfundo project, part of an £800 million education programme, will bring together public and private sector commitment to use IT to ensure effective teacher training and education management. We will give top priority to combating the spread of HIV/AIDS, which is inflicting massive human and economic costs across the developing world. We will work for the creation of a global health fund to make essential drugs and commodities more accessible to the poor, focusing on TB, malaria and HIV/AIDS. This will complement our existing support for the development of basic healthcare systems, and our new tax credits to incentivise research by the drug companies into the diseases of poverty.  Development goes much wider than aid and debt relief. It is also about how we manage the global economy. Our aim is to shape globalisation so that it works better for the worlds poor.  Trade is key but so is private investment. We will promote socially responsible business practice through advisory services on codes of social responsibility, the ethical trading initiative, the Export Credit Guarantee Departments new code of business principles, the Commonwealth Development Corporations partnership with the private sector, and our initiatives to encourage private investment in infrastructure.  Nowhere will our resolve be more tested than in Africa. Labour is committed to strengthening our partnership for development with Africa. We will work with reforming governments, international institutions, the private sector and civil society in support of nationally owned development strategies. We will also redouble our efforts to prevent and resolve violent conflicts in Africa, using our new Africa conflict fund to provide help for security sector reform, demilitarisation programmes and tighter controls over small arms.  The poor make the smallest per capita contribution to climate change, but are often most affected when it happens. We are convinced by the scientific evidence of climate change  and convinced that now is the time to act. We need action at local, national and international level if we are to preserve the stability of our natural environment over the next 50 years. The principle of mutual responsibility that governs our approach to social problems also applies to environmental issues.  The healthy future of our environment is one of the worlds great challenges. We must make substantial changes in the way we work and live to safeguard all our futures. The UK played a leading role in the Kyoto conference. The targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions agreed at that conference are a vital first step in the battle against global warming. It is critical that the whole international community plays its part in making a reality of sustainable development. We are determined to play a constructive role at the Rio plus 10 meeting in environmental challenge Natural resources Labour is committed to a healthy environment and renewable energy, taxing pollution and rewarding clean production Promoting human rights Tony Blair with Nelson Mandela International aid education has a special place for Labour  The choices for Britain .  25 steps to a better Britain.  These are our ambitions for Britain  and how they can be achieved. Clear in our values, confident in our policies, we seek a new mandate from the British people.  We are proud of our record in government. But we are not yet satisfied. Labour is the party of reform and we fight this election as agents of change in Britain.  Change to our economy, so more people share the benefits of growth. Change in our public services, so that they better advance equality of opportunity. Change in our welfare system, so that we extend security, responsibility and independence. Change to tackle crime and its causes. Change to deepen our democracy. Change to Britains role in the world.  The Conservatives were rejected in 1997 because they had failed. The national debt had doubled; crime had doubled; we were 42nd in the world education league; one in five households was on benefit; and we were marginalised in Europe.  Yet instead of learning, the Conservatives have become more dogmatic, more extreme, more divided. They are worse than ever.  The British people now face a choice. New Labour stands in the political mainstream, rooted in the best values of the British people. The Conservatives have veered to extreme positions.  This election will decide whether we continue the policies that have brought us economic stability, steady growth, investment in public services and targeted tax cuts for children and families, or whether we lurch back to boom and bust. It will decide whether we put our schools, hospitals and police officers first, or put them second after unaffordable tax cuts. It will decide whether we modernise the criminal justice system. It will decide whether we stand for a positive engagement with Europe and the wider world, or retreat to the sidelines.  We want everyone to vote in this election. But before you do, think of your job; think of your mortgage; think of your school and hospital; think of your children and your parents; think of police and crime prevention, think of the choice of leadership.  Think of who you want to succeed in Britain  the many or the few.  There is still much to do with new Labour  and a lot for you to lose under the Conservatives.  The choice is clear: for an ambitious and confident Britain, the choice is Labour.  The contract delivered  In the 1997 Labour manifesto Tony Blair said: We set out in the manifesto that follows ten commitments, commitments that form our bond of trust with the people. Judge us on them.  Have trust in us and we will repay that trust. This is our contract with the people. This is a summary of Labours record since 1997. For more information on Labours policies, please visit our website at www.labour.org.uk, or contact your local Labour campaign team.  1. Education will be our number one priority, and we will increase the share of national income spent on education as we decrease it on the bills of economic and social failure.  The record: Key Stage 2 results for literacy and numeracy reached 75 per cent (up 12 per cent since 1997) and 72 per cent (up 10 per cent since 1997) in 2001. GCSE and A-level results have also improved. This September there will be no five-, six- and seven-year-olds in class sizes over 30. We have cut the costs of debt and unemployment by nearly £9 billion per year. Education spending has risen from 4.7 per cent of national income to 5 per cent this year.  2. There will be no increase in the basic or top rates of income tax.  The record: We cut the basic rate of income tax to 22p in April 2000 and introduced the 10p band in April 1999. There has been no increase in the top rate of income tax. The direct tax burden on a single earner family on average earnings with two children is the lowest since 1972.  3. We will provide stable economic growth with low inflation and promote dynamic and competitive business and industry at home and abroad.  The record: Net borrowing in every year from 1997 to 2003-04 is forecast to be lower than in any Tory year from 1992-93 to 1996-97.  Inflation has been consistently under control and on target. Economic growth has been steady, averaging 2.75 per cent a year since 1997. Living standards are on average about 10 per cent higher in real terms than in 1997.  4. We will get 250,000 young unemployed off benefit and into work.  The record: Over 280,000 unemployed young people have been helped into work by Labours New Deal. There are over one million more jobs in the economy than in 1997. Youth unemployment now stands at its lowest level since 1975, longterm unemployment among under-25s is down 75 per cent. Unemployment is at its lowest level for 25 years.  5. We will rebuild the NHS, reducing spending on administration and increasing spending on patient care.  The record: The next four years will see the biggest-ever sustained increase in NHS spending. Over £1 billion will have been released from administration by next year. The NHS is treating 620,000 more in-patients and is seeing over 650,000 more outpatients than in 1996-97. There are 17,100 more nurses and 6,700 more doctors than in 1997. There are 124,000 fewer people on waiting lists.  6. We will be tough on crime and tough on the causes of crime, and halve the time it takes persistent juvenile offenders to come to court.  The record: The British Crime Survey shows that overall crime fell by 10 per cent from 1997 to 1999. Investment is now rising. The time from arrest to sentence for persistent young offenders is down from 142 days to 89 days  on track to halve the time within the five years promised in 1997.  7. We will help build strong families and strong communities, and lay the foundations of a modern welfare state in pensions and community care.  The record: Child benefit has been raised by over 25 per cent for the first child. The Childrens Tax Credit is worth up to £520 a year. We have introduced parental leave and rights to holidays.  We have extended maternity leave. £4.5 billion extra in real terms is being spent this year on pensioners. The basic state pension will rise to £75.50 for single pensioners and £120.70 for pensioner couples next year, while the minimum income guarantee is helping over 1.6 million of the poorest pensioners. TV licence fees have been abolished for the over-75s, with free access to national museums and galleries for children and pensioners.  8. We will safeguard our environment, and develop an integrated transport policy to fight congestion and pollution.  The record: With the private sector, we will invest a record £180 billion in transport infrastructure over the next ten years. We will achieve a 23 per cent cut in greenhouse gas emissions. We have legislated to promote protection for and access to the countryside.  A £1.6 billion strategy for farming and rural enterprise will redirect subsidies to promote growth and the environment.  9. We will clean up politics, decentralise political power throughout the United Kingdom and put the funding of political parties on a proper and accountable basis.  The record: The funding of political parties, campaign expenditure and conduct of referendums is now regulated. For the first time the UK has a Freedom of Information Act. The Scottish Parliament, Welsh Assembly and Northern Ireland Assembly are now up and running, while local democracy has been returned to the people of London. The first stage of reform of the House of Lords has reduced the number of hereditary peers to fewer than 100.  10. We will give Britain the leadership in Europe which Britain and Europe need.  The record: Labour has negotiated successfully for Britain in Europe. Our rebate is protected, enlargement is being taken forward. We have led the debate on European economic reform and on the development of a European defence capacity rooted in NATO structures. In Kosovo, our armed forces played a leading role in standing up against ethnic cleansing. Britain strong in the world Strong and safe communities Fast, high-quality healthcare A modern welfare state Jobs. Interest rates. Education. Health. Crime. The choice at this election is clear to make more progress or to dismantle the foundations laid since 1997. This manifesto sets out Labours ambitions for Britainand how they will be achieved."
"Liberal Democrats",200106,"LIBERAL DEMOCRAT 2001 GENERAL ELECTION MANIFESTO  FREEDOM  JUSTICE  HONESTY     Three simple words. Freedom, justice, honesty. These sum up what the Liberal Democrats stand for. Freedom  because everybody should have the opportunity to make the most of their life. Justice  because freedom depends on fairness. Honesty  because where fairness has a cost, like investing in schools, hospitals and pensions, we explain how it will be paid for.  This manifesto sets out our priorities: investing in schools and hospitals to cut class sizes and waiting times; extra police to prevent crime and catch criminals; increasing the basic state pension; and providing free personal care.  In Scotland, where Liberal Democrats are part of the government, we have already guaranteed free personal care. We have also abolished tuition fees, and we want to do this for the rest of the United Kingdom.  We will also recognise the professionalism of teachers, doctors, nurses and the police, valuing their contribution to the community. We believe that they must be given the freedom to exercise their professional judgement.  All our policies have a green dimension. So there is an environmental section in every chapter, a green thread binding together all our thinking. Without steps to preserve our planet for future generations, none of our other policies would have much purpose.     A Real Chance for Real Change  The United Kingdom has huge potential. Unlock the energies, skills and talents of its people, and its rich ethnic and cultural diversity, and there is nothing that cannot be achieved.  But we do not want government always telling people how to develop those assets. So in this manifesto every section explains how we want government to stop interfering.  Government works best as an enabler. Its task is not to curb but to stimulate. To enjoy true freedom, people must have good education, decent healthcare, reliable public transport, safety on the streets and a secure income in old age. The state must provide these basic public services to allow all its citizens to achieve their full potential.  Under eighteen years of Conservative government, these freedoms steadily diminished. The sick waited longer for operations. Children were taught in larger and larger classes. Rail passengers suffered the consequences of a disastrous privatisation. Crime rose. Pensioners' incomes fell behind. But Labour has been disappointing, sticking quite unnecessarily for two years to Tory spending limits.  Our programme for government will deliver more. For schools, hospitals, pensioners, the police and the environment, we offer Britain a real chance for real change.  APPLICABILITY AND COSTINGS  This document contains Federal Liberal Democrat policy, except in areas where policy of the Scottish and Welsh Liberal Democrats applies. Separate manifestos set out our agenda for Scotland and Wales. Guarantees represent our minimum commitment over a five-year Parliament. This manifesto also sets out policies to be implemented as economic growth allows. Our ambitions are not limited to these, and are set out in other policy documents. A full costing of our programme has been published with this manifesto. Figures included in both are changes to existing Government revenue and spending plans due to our manifesto commitments. Except for specified items, all Departments will work within current spending plans, unless economic growth allows more. Figures presented are calculated on a UK-wide basis to make comparisons with UK-wide figures from central government and other parties. Different priorities in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland may result in different priorities in practice in the budgetary areas they control.        HEALTH  MORE STAFF, FASTER NHS TREATMENT  Health is a fundamental freedom. No one can fulfil their potential without the best possible health. We will prioritise investment to cut waiting times. But we also believe that it is best to improve health by preventing illness, tackling pollution and reducing poverty.     LIBERAL DEMOCRATS WILL:  - CUT WAITING TIMES BY RECRUITING 27,500 MORE NURSES, 4,600 MORE DOCTORS, AND 10,250 MORE PROFESSIONALS ALLIED TO MEDICINE.  - CUT WAITING TIMES BY RETAINING MORE STAFF THROUGH INCREASING PAY FOR THE WORST PAID NHS STAFF BY AN AVERAGE OF £1000 EACH PER YEAR.  - CUT WAITING TIMES BY PROVIDING AN ADDITIONAL 10,000 BEDS.  - KEEP PEOPLE HEALTHY BY INVESTING IN SCANNING EQUIPMENT AND ABOLISHING CHARGES FOR DENTAL AND EYE CHECKS.  - END THE SCANDAL OF ELDERLY AND LONG-TERM PATIENTS HAVING TO PAY FOR LONG-TERM PERSONAL CARE COSTS  The NHS has suffered for decades from under-investment, most notably during the eighteen years of the Thatcher and Major Governments. Labour promised to save the NHS. Instead, they spent three years unnecessarily locked into the Conservative spending plans which caused the problem in the first place. The new NHS plan falls far short of Tony Blair's declared aim of bringing health spending in Britain up to the levels of our European neighbours.  The NHS still lacks the capacity to give patients the first-class treatment which they deserve. It is short of staff, beds, hospitals and residential homes. Liberal Democrats offer something different based on clear and distinct priorities. Our starting point is that prevention is better than cure.  It is also important to give professionals greater freedom to do their jobs. Labour has tried to control far too much of the NHS from the centre. The Conservatives attempt to apply market principles produced inefficiency and inequity. Liberal Democrats will cut the role of Whitehall back and give doctors and managers the freedom to get on and run the NHS without political interference.     CUTTING WAITING TIMES  Lengthy waiting times are one of the worst aspects of the NHS. The best way to cut waiting times is to increase the number of doctors, nurses and professionals allied to medicine. They are the greatest asset of the NHS and increasing their numbers is the best way of increasing the capacity of the NHS. Under the Conservatives, too many left and too few were trained and recruited. Four years on, the service is just as overstretched. There is also now a severe year-round lack of acute and intermediate care beds and the staff to support them. To cut waiting times, we will:  - PROVIDE TRAINING PLACES FOR AN EXTRA 4,600 DOCTORS AND 27,500 NURSES AND MIDWIVES over five years. This means an extra 2,500 training places for doctors and 7,500 for nurses on top of the measures that the government has proposed in the NHS National Plan. We would also provide 10,250 extra professionals allied to medicine such as occupational therapists, podiatrists, physiotherapists and speech therapists. This means an extra 3,750 training places on top of the measures that the government has proposed.  - REWARD LOW-PAID NURSES, MIDWIVES AND OTHER LOW-PAID PROFESSIONALS BY PAYING THEM AN ADDITIONAL £1000 ON AVERAGE EVERY YEAR. We will also boost staff retention by making additional funds available for pay increases for other NHS staff. After taking these immediate steps to help retain dedicated staff, we would set up a Commission to examine terms and working conditions throughout the health service, and to establish a single pay review system to ensure fairness for all staff. After taking these immediate steps to help retain dedicated staff, we would set up a Commission to examine terms and working conditions throughout the health service, and to establish a single pay review system to ensure fairness for all staff.  - PROVIDE AN EXTRA 10,000 HOSPITAL BEDS OVER FIVE YEARS. This means providing 3,000 extra beds on top of the governments current plans. We also will review the criteria by which PFI contracts are judged, creating a level playing field between different financial options and so ensure there are enough new beds to meet local health needs.  - GUARANTEE BOOKED DATES FOR APPOINTMENTS WITH CONSULTANTS AND FOR SURGERY after the GP first refers a patient.  - GIVE PRIORITY TO THE MOST NEEDY. We will introduce a scorecard system that takes account not just of clinical need but also of the needs of the patient. This would give doctors objective guidelines to help them (but not bind them) in determining priorities.     KEEPING PEOPLE HEALTHY  To support good health it is vital to tackle poverty and to have a clean environment. But it is also important that the National Health Service delivers high quality preventive care. The NHS should not just be a National Sickness Service. We will invest more in early detection and prevention, and in improving the environment. This will not only achieve better levels of health, but also save money in the long run. Liberal Democrats will:  - INJECT AN EXTRA £500 MILLION OVER FIVE YEARS INTO DENTAL SERVICES. The money will be used to guarantee access for everyone to an NHS dentist. We will do so by rewarding dentists' for working in the NHS and offering them incentives to invest in new equipment and buildings, to encourage practitioners to return to NHS work. The British Dental Association estimates that this would bring back the equivalent of 1000 full-time dentists to NHS work.  - DOUBLE THE GOVERNMENTS COMMITMENT TO INVEST MORE IN THE LATEST SCANNING AND DIAGNOSTIC EQUIPMENT. We will provide extra advanced equipment in hospitals across the country.  - RESTORE FREE NHS DENTAL CHECK-UPS FOR ALL to promote oral health and prevent disease.  - PROVIDE FREE EYE CHECKS FOR ALL to ensure that problems are spotted earlier.  - APPOINT A MINISTER OF PUBLIC HEALTH based in the Cabinet Office rather than the Department of Health to co-ordinate all aspects of public health policy across government departments.  - MAKE MORE TESTS AVAILABLE IN GP SURGERIES AND PHARMACIES for diabetes, cholesterol, anaemia, HIV/AIDS, TB, prostate and colorectal diseases.  - PROMOTE A WIDER AVAILABILITY OF COMPLEMENTARY MEDICINES AND HEALTHCARE THROUGH THE NHS to take maximum advantage of different approaches to health.     CARING FOR PATIENTS  All too often, the NHS fails to provide the care that patients need. Except in Scotland, people in long-term care have to pay for someone to bath or feed them. Drugs available on the NHS in one part of the country are not available in another - the postcode lottery. Liberal Democrats will:  - PAY FOR ALL LONG-TERM PERSONAL CARE COSTS. The Royal Commission on Long Term Care, set up by Labour, recommended that these costs should be met by the state. The Westminster Government ignored this key finding, though Liberal Democrats in Scotland are using their influence in the Scottish Executive to implement it.  - TACKLE THE POSTCODE LOTTERY which means that some medicines are only available in some parts of the country. We will scrap the present secretive system for buying medicines. In its place we will create a Pharmaceutical Agency to use the purchasing power of the NHS to drive down the price of established drugs and secure the more sophisticated medicines and technologies at affordable prices. The money saved would be used to end the postcode lottery and make advanced and expensive drugs more available within the NHS. Over time, we will use further savings to reduce and eventually scrap prescription charges for all.  In the long term we will aim to:  - INCREASE FUNDING FOR MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES. All people in need of care and support should be assessed individually to ensure that they receive the treatment they need. Our proposals for ending the postcode lottery will ensure that mental health care offers the best treatment with the fewest side effects. This will encourage them to comply with treatment and diminish the risk to themselves and to the community.  - INCREASE LOCAL AUTHORITY SOCIAL SERVICES BUDGETS. This would provide more community care places, improve preventive and rehabilitation services, give further support and respite to carers, and provide more social workers to support elderly people, those with learning difficulties and others.     IMPROVING QUALITY  Patients should have a right to a high-quality NHS. They should know how well the NHS is performing and who is responsible when things go wrong. They should also have access to proper information about their own cases. Vulnerable people need someone to champion them if they are not receiving adequate treatment. The private sector should complement, not compete with, the NHS, which we are committed to making world class, comprehensive and accessible to everyone. Labour have not addressed these questions adequately. When they abolished Community Health Councils, they failed to set up an adequate alternative. Liberal Democrats will:     - DEVELOP PATIENT CARE GUARANTEES, to provide patients with minimum standards of treatment, to which the NHS will be held accountable. We will start by building on existing National Service Frameworks (NSFs), for example on cancer, heart disease and mental health, and ensure that future NSFs incorporate Patient Care Guarantees. We will develop new NSFs on children in care, prosthetic limbs, hepatitis C, HIV and AIDS, palliative care, nutrition, adoption, neurological services, diabetes, maternity services and dentistry among others.  - MAKE THE NHS MORE ACCOUNTABLE by increasing local democracy on Trust and Primary Care Trust boards, giving the Commons Health Select Committee more resources and increasing the powers of the Health Ombudsman to examine policies and initiate inquiries. We will also transfer local responsibility for public health from health authorities to local councils.  - GIVE PATIENTS ACCESS TO INDEPENDENT ADVOCATES. Children, frail elderly people and those with learning difficulties would particularly benefit. There would be a Children's Rights Commissioner to represent children.  - INTRODUCE NO-FAULT COMPENSATION. At the moment, compensation for medical negligence is a lottery. While some are awarded excessive multi-million pound payouts, the length and cost of the process of going to court leaves others with nothing. Our system would be far simpler, with fair compensation for patients and their families, and an end to burdensome legal costs.  - PROMOTE BETTER ACCESS TO SERVICES. If local NHS services do not offer patients the treatment they need, we will enable the patient to use an alternative facility. Choice will extend into use of the private sector  but at NHS cost price.  - END THE USE OF MIXED WARDS so that patients have more dignity when they are in hospital.  - LEGISLATE AGAINST DISCRIMINATION ON THE GROUNDS OF AGE IN HEALTH AND SOCIAL CARE. Clinical need, not preconceived judgments about age, should be the criterion for deciding who receives treatment and when.     SETTING YOU FREE  - STOP GOVERNMENT WASTING DOCTORS AND NURSES TIME by scrapping meaningless bureaucratic targets. National targets for waiting lists serve no purpose. Doctors, not government, should decide priorities for treatment, using guidelines which allow them to assess patients' needs fairly and openly.     GREEN ACTION  HEALTHY HOMES  We will improve health by requiring an energy efficiency audit to be completed on all homes before sale to promote high energy efficiency standards throughout the housing market. Coupled with our comprehensive strategy to tackle fuel poverty this will mean that everyone can have a warm home. This will tackle the damp and cold which affect the health of millions of people, and reduce winter deaths caused by fuel poverty. With less energy needed to heat homes, CO~2~ emissions will also be reduced.  CLEAN AIR  We will tackle the air pollution responsible for respiratory problems like asthma by introducing incentives for people to switch to less polluting vehicles, reducing reliance on cars by increasing the use of public transport, and tackling industrial pollution. We will also provide better quality information, increasing the number of air monitoring sites for key pollutants in all areas.     EDUCATION AND EMPLOYMENT  INVESTMENT IN EDUCATION   FOR ALL OUR FUTURES  High quality education is the key to personal freedom. We believe that every child matters. Education provides the freedom to choose a fulfilling job, the freedom to exploit one's talents to the full, and the freedom to contribute fully to society. Education is also the key to Britains future prosperity.  LIBERAL DEMOCRATS WILL:  - CUT CLASS SIZES TO 25 ON AVERAGE FOR 5-11 YEAR-OLDS  - RECRUIT 5000 EXTRA SECONDARY SCHOOL TEACHERS TO REDUCE CLASS SIZES FOR 11-16 YEAR-OLDS  - INCREASE FUNDING FOR BOOKS AND EQUIPMENT IN SCHOOLS  - CUT BUREAUCRACY IN SCHOOLS AND INTERFERE LESS IN THE PROFESSIONAL JUDGEMENTS OF TEACHERS  - ABOLISH UNIVERSITY TUITION FEES     Britain has been held back by under-investment in education. Children from poorer families have been particularly ill-served. The Conservatives failed to fund schools and colleges adequately. Labour have done far too little to put things right. In schools, they have invested in paperwork rather than people, demoralising teachers and wasting resources by creating a mountain of extra bureaucracy. In the Higher Education sector, they have made matters worse by introducing university tuition fees.  We are clear about our goals and determined to reach them. Our plans will cost around £3 billion extra each year. We guarantee to introduce the extra funding needed at the beginning of the next Parliament, irrespective of short-term economic growth. We will put an extra penny on the basic rate of income tax to meet this commitment. Growth in the future may allow us to be more ambitious still.  We believe that most day-to-day decision-making in education is best done by teachers, schools and local authorities, not by central government.     EVERY CHILD MATTERS: CLASS SIZES AND TEACHERS  Under the Conservatives, class sizes were far too high. Even the most dedicated teachers cannot give the attention which pupils need when there are more than thirty to a class. Labour pledged to do better, but their reduction of class sizes for 5-7 year olds came at the price of larger classes for 8-11 year olds. The parents whose children were five in 1997 now see their nine year-olds suffering the consequences of this sleight of hand. In secondary schools, classes are larger than they have been for twenty years.  To make a real difference to class sizes and improve standards achieved by all children, more teachers are needed in schools. The Conservatives under-valued and demoralised the profession. Many of Labour's efforts to make amends have misfired. Performance-related pay is a crude and unfair approach to rewarding teachers. Teachers are also burdened with more and more unnecessary bureaucracy. Small wonder that there is now a grave shortage of teachers. Liberal Democrats will spend over £1 billion extra each year to:  - CUT CLASS SIZES TO 25 FOR ALL 5-11 YEAR OLDS. We will do this by establishing a maximum average class size of 25 in each local authoritys primary schools.  - FUND 5000 ADDITIONAL SECONDARY TEACHER PLACES. This will bring pupil:teacher ratios back to around 1997 levels and start to improve on them. We will put particular emphasis on recruiting teachers in shortage subjects.  - GUARANTEE A CLASSROOM ASSISTANT for every 25 pupils in the 5-7 age bracket (Key Stage 1) to improve the ratio of adults to children in infant school classrooms. We will provide 40,000 extra classroom assistants, including 25,000 for 5-7 year olds, compared to the governments plan to spread 20,000 across all age groups.  - INTRODUCE PAID PREPARATION HOURS FOR PRIMARY TEACHERS. By funding extra posts, we will be able to allow all primary teachers two paid hours a week to prepare and plan lessons.  - PAY TRAINEE TEACHERS A FULL TRAINING SALARY REPLACING THE CURRENT TRAINING GRANTS to improve teacher recruitment.  - REDUCE BUREAUCRACY by scrapping the Teacher Training Agency and giving its functions to the General Teaching Council.  - IMPROVE INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY (ICT) SUPPORT FOR TEACHERS. At the moment, teachers have to spend too much time out of the classroom maintaining computer equipment and so have less time to devote to their pupils. Drawing on the experience of the recently established e-learning foundations, we will establish educational charitable trusts to arrange the lease of computer equipment and services. We will also invest in training related to the use of new science equipment.  - SCRAP PERFORMANCE RELATED PAY. Instead we will link teachers' pay with professional development to boost morale in the teaching profession and improve retention of experienced teachers. Teachers will have the opportunity to take a series of in-service training courses. Each time they pass, they will gain a significant salary increase.  In the long term, our goal is:  - A MAXIMUM AVERAGE CLASS SIZE OF 18 for all secondary classes with a practical element such as science and modern languages     EVERY CHILD MATTERS: BOOKS AND EQUIPMENT  There are still too many schools having to make do with dog-eared and outdated textbooks shared between several pupils. Schools also lack the computer equipment needed to prepare children for the digital age in which they live and will have to work. Liberal Democrats will:  - INCREASE FUNDING FOR BOOKS AND EQUIPMENT IN SCHOOLS over and above existing spending levels. We would provide an average of £1250 per primary school and £4250 per secondary school per year. Schools could choose to spend this money on books Information Communications Technology (ICT) software such as CD-ROMs.  - INCREASE FUNDING FOR ICT AND SCIENCE equipment and purchase and maintenance, and ICT training for teachers within schools, over and above existing spending levels.     WIDENING CHOICE, CUTTING BUREAUCRACY  Under the Conservatives and Labour, schools have been deluged with bureaucracy absorbing far too much of teachers' time to the detriment of their pupils. Whitehall has enclosed the school system in a straitjacket which stifles professional creativity and confines teachers to a curriculum which is too narrow and cannot adapt to local circumstances. We will:  - REPLACE THE NATIONAL CURRICULUM WITH A LESS RIGID MINIMUM CURRICULUM ENTITLEMENT. We will provide for a broad and balanced curriculum including languages, science, maths, the humanities, physical development (including sports instruction and advice on healthy eating), religious education, parenting, citizenship and creative arts. We will increase funding for free musical tuition to encourage more children to learn an instrument.  - REPLACE ALL NATIONAL SCHOOL TARGETS with a statutory requirement for schools to develop individual education plans for pupils, with clear individual targets and criteria for improvement. The quality of the plans would be guaranteed through national value-added criteria.  - MAINTAIN THE KEY ROLE OF LOCAL EDUCATION AUTHORITIES in providing education and guaranteeing standards and in co-ordinating vital services such as the provision of Special Educational Needs.  - ANNUALLY REVIEW ALL WHITEHALL DIRECTIVES. This would result in an annual cull of all irrelevant instructions to LEAs, schools and governing bodies.  - ISSUE ANNUAL REPORTS TO ALL PARENTS ON THEIR CHILDRENS SCHOOL'S PERFORMANCE. Unlike the current crude league tables, these reports would measure the value added each year by a school, using the test results from a childs start at the school as the baseline. This will result in league tables that genuinely show how schools are performing. We will also promote school councils to give pupils a greater say in how their school is run.  - REDUCE TESTING OF THE YOUNGEST SCHOOL CHILDREN. We will scrap testing (SATs) at age 7, while keeping it for older pupils.  - REFORM THE SCHOOL INSPECTION SYSTEM. Tough, independent inspection is essential, but the current approach of Ofsted often intimidates schools instead of helping them. We will require inspectors to offer advice on improvement, not merely criticism, and require Ofsted to take account of a school's self-evaluation. We will also establish Departments within Ofsted for each of the various areas which it inspects (such as Early Years and Schools), and ensure each is headed up by someone with technical expertise in the subject.  In the long term, our goal is to:  - REDUCE THE DISPARITY IN PER-PUPIL FUNDING through a minimum education funding entitlement based on the current median level.  - PROMOTE CO-OPERATION BETWEEN STATE AND PRIVATE SCHOOLS. We will encourage independent schools to share their facilities with state schools to spread opportunity for all. We will require independent schools to offer the Minimum Curriculum Entitlement. We will extend charitable status to all schools and maintain the VAT exemption on school fees.     EARLY YEARS EDUCATION  Under both Labour and Conservative governments the inequalities in British society have been increased by the lack of proper early years education. Better-off children, with greater stimulus from the home, pre-school playgroups or from nursery schools, have had a flying start at primary school over those who have not had these advantages. Often children deprived in these early years never catch up. Too much early years provision is still not of a sufficient standard. We will guarantee quality nursery education, which makes a real contribution to intellectual, emotional and social development at this all-important stage in life. We will:  - FUND 1000 EARLY YEARS SPECIALISTS to work with early years development partnerships to ensure that children receive proper stimulus in the early years either at nursery school, pre-school playgroups or at home.  - ESTABLISH A BUDGET TO GIVE ADDITIONAL TRAINING TO NURSERY TEACHERS. This would fund courses and extra supply teachers to cover for those undertaking training.  - INCREASE FUNDING FOR OUTDOOR FACILITIES FOR NURSERIES. Ultimately, all nurseries should have a place for children to play out of doors.  - STRENGTHEN LINKS BETWEEN HOME AND SCHOOL recognising that children's early development depends critically on the relationship between school and family.  - ENSURE THAT THE EARLY YEARS CURRICULUM HAS SUFFICIENT QUALITY AND BREADTH to facilitate intellectual, emotional and social development and ensure that play is recognised as a key component of this process.        HIGHER EDUCATION  Britain's universities have traditionally had a high international reputation. During the eighteen years of Conservative rule, that reputation was threatened by an ever tighter squeeze on resources. Labour has attempted to address the problem of underfunding by the counterproductive method of introducing tuition fees, which deter many students from going to university. Tuition fees also impose great hardship on many who take up university places, and their parents. We are also opposed to the levying of top-up fees. Liberal Democrats will:  - ABOLISH UNIVERSITY TUITION FEES throughout the United Kingdom. Liberal Democrats have already achieved this in Scotland by making it a priority issue and have set abolition in train in Wales.  - REFORM STUDENT MAINTENANCE. We would restore grants for poor students and access to benefits for all during the summer holidays, and raise the salary threshold at which student loans are repaid, in the first instance from £10,000 to £13,000 per year.  - IMPROVE ACCESS FOR UNDER-REPRESENTED GROUPS by tripling the incentive payments for recruitment and retention of under-represented, mature and part-time students. We would pay colleges one third on admission and two thirds on completion of a course.  - IMPROVE SALARIES TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN HIGH-QUALITY STAFF. Our first steps will be to end the unacceptable gap between pay for men and women at universities and to tackle similar inequalities faced by casual and part-time staff.  - ENSURE THAT UNIVERSITIES ARE PROPERLY RESOURCED by opposing any reduction in the unit of resource  the money that a university receives per student. In the long term, our goal is to increase the unit of resource.     FURTHER EDUCATION AND LIFELONG LEARNING  Few jobs these days are for life. To succeed as a nation, we need a flexible workforce which is used to acquiring new skills. Access to good quality further education is equally important to individuals as a means of fulfilling their aspirations. For too long, this sector has been at the bottom of the educational pile. Liberal Democrats see further education as an important priority. We will:  - GIVE EVERY ADULT AN ENTITLEMENT TO PUBLICLY FUNDED TUITION. We will provide the funding to allow any adult the chance to acquire a Level 2 qualification (the equivalent of 5 GCSEs at grades A to C, an intermediate GNVQ or a Foundation Modern Apprenticeship). We will fund those aged 16 to 24 up to Level 3 (equivalent to 2 A-Levels at grades A to E, an Advanced GNVQ or an Advanced Modern Apprenticeship). In the long term, our goal is to extend this further entitlement to every adult. All those on these courses would be entitled to a student loan to cover maintenance, depending on their income.  - SIMPLIFY THE FUNDING AND QUALIFICATION SYSTEMS. We will merge the Learning and Skills Council and the Higher Education Funding Council for England into a single Learning Council for England. We will also reform the National Vocational Qualification system to cut bureaucracy and allow students to accumulate credits from different courses and transfer them.  In the long term, our goal is to:  - GIVE EVERY CITIZEN AN INDIVIDUAL LEARNING ACCOUNT. Ultimately this approach to life-long learning would provide the flexibility to access each persons entitlement to post-sixteen education throughout a persons life, rather than at times imposed by the state. Tuition would be paid for and student loans would be available for maintenance. This would help, for example, women with children who have to study part-time.     EMPLOYMENT AND TRAINING  Britain is still held back by a lack of skills in the workforce. Without placing unnecessary burdens on individual firms, Liberal Democrats are committed to training programmes which would bring enormous benefits to the economy as a whole.  The recent relative health of the economy has concealed hotspots of unemployment and deprivation in many parts of the country. Labour's efforts to combat unemployment have not always been directed where they are most needed. We will:  - INTRODUCE TAX INCENTIVES FOR SMALL AND MEDIUM-SIZED ENTERPRISES TO IMPROVE TRAINING. Companies eligible would include those working with Investors in People, those introducing a company training plan under the Skills for Small Businesses programme, and those training an employee to master training level. We will also require all registered companies to report on staff training and development in their Annual Reports and Accounts.  - EMPOWER NATIONAL TRAINING ORGANISATIONS TO CONDUCT BALLOTS OF MEMBER EMPLOYERS. This will enable them to introduce a training levy if support is demonstrated.  - ENTITLE EVERY 16-24 YEAR-OLD TO STUDY LEAVE WITH PAY. Employers will be obliged to release their staff for courses which are relevant to their work. The scheme will be implemented in consultation with small businesses.  - REPLACE THE NEW DEAL WITH A FLEXIBLE GUARANTEE OF HELP FOR ALL JOBSEEKERS, administered through a combined Benefits and Jobs Agency. This will be a world-class job search and placement service. It will be equally open to those not on the unemployment register who would like work.  - TACKLE UNEMPLOYMENT HOTSPOTS BY TRANSFERRING BUDGETS TO THE NATIONS AND REGIONS OF THE UK. A proportion of the Government's Employment Opportunities Fund should be administered by the nations and regions which are best placed to spend the money effectively alongside their economic regeneration budgets.     SETTING YOU FREE  - ABOLISH THE EXCESSIVE BENEFIT SANCTIONS BROUGHT IN UNDER THE NEW DEAL. These have done little to encourage people back to work and have made the families of those penalised suffer. We will not impose further sanctions until the effects of existing penalties have been evaluated.  - STOP GOVERNMENT WASTING TEACHERS TIME by scrapping directives and targets in education which undermine the professional judgement and expertise of teachers. We will also return the main responsibilities for standards to universities themselves.     GREEN ACTION  LEARNING FOR A GREEN FUTURE  We will increase environmental awareness amongst young people, by encouraging local environmental projects and by teaching sustainability in schools. Childrens influence on their parents involvement in green activities will relate directly to the aims of our National Recycling Programme.  HEALTHY AND SAFE JOURNEYS TO SCHOOL  We will promote the development of Safe Routes to School, to encourage parents to allow their children to walk or cycle to school in safety rather than driving them. Children will gain benefits for their physical health from the increased exercise. At the same time, this will assist in reducing congestion and pollution during peak times of the day by reducing car use.  GREENER SCHOOL BUILDINGS  We will fund a 'Schools 2010' programme to tackle the backlog of school building repairs. The programme would include environmental assessment of buildings and would promote the use of better insulation, double-glazing and solar panels where possible. We will work in partnership with the Further and Higher Education sectors to develop a similar scheme that covers all educational establishments.     LAW AND ORDER  CUTTING CRIME  MORE RESOURCES, JUSTICE FOR ALL  We all want freedom from crime. Fear of crime blights the lives of many people, particularly the most vulnerable in society. The state should offer all its citizens equal and adequate protection. Our approach is rooted in the belief that the best way to beat crime in the medium and long term is to have effective policies to tackle its causes.      LIBERAL DEMOCRATS WILL:  - RECRUIT 6000 EXTRA POLICE OFFICERS  - FUND 2000 PART-TIME COMMUNITY OFFICERS  - REINFORCE FRONT-LINE POLICE WITH A NEW COMMUNITY SAFETY CONSTABULARY AND BY RETAINING RETIRED OFFICERS IN A BACK-UP ROLE  - CUT REOFFENDING BY PREPARING PRISONERS ADEQUATELY FOR A LAW-ABIDING LIFE ON THEIR RELEASE  - GIVE VICTIMS GREATER RIGHTS TO BE HEARD IN COURT  During their eighteen years in office, the Conservatives pursued a policy on crime which was superficially populist yet highly ineffective. They filled the prisons to overflowing, at a huge cost to the taxpayer. Crime doubled, violent rose crime year after year, and the number of convictions fell. Meanwhile, contrary to repeated promises, police numbers fell during the last Conservative government.  Labour has been trying to sound as tough or tougher than the Conservatives, but it is no more effective. Police numbers have fallen further over the past four years. Labour too often proposes simplistic solutions. Many are impractical or irrelevant. Some actually undermine civil liberties.     POLICE  Our priority is to increase police numbers to prevent crime, to catch criminals when offences do take place, and to increase the current deplorably low clear-up rate. To make policing across the country more effective, we will:  - FUND THE POLICE FOR 6000 MORE POLICE OFFICERS than March 2000 levels. We will fund 2000 recruits on top of the governments plans to ensure there is real increase in police strength, not just replacing cuts under Labour and the Conservatives. We will also ensure that the police spend more time on front-line policing and provide extra resources to boost retention of police officers.  - FUND 2000 PART-TIME COMMUNITY OFFICERS by creating a new category of part time retained police officers. This would give the police more flexibility. Suitable members of the public and police officers near retirement wishing to continue in work will be recruited, given proper training and equipped for the duties of a police constable. The scheme will build on the current role of unpaid special constables, and free existing police to use their time and resources more effectively. Retained officers will supplement the work of regular police and provide a more adequate presence in areas where resources have not permitted. This scheme will help to meet our aim of creating a network of named local police officers for every community.  - ESTABLISH A COMMUNITY SAFETY FORCE to work with the police by co-ordinating the public safety work of traffic wardens, estate and neighbourhood wardens, park superintendents and other public officials who deal with nuisance crimes like littering, vandalism and graffiti. They will receive special training. This will free the police to concentrate on more serious offences.  - MAKE LOCAL CRIME AND DISORDER PARTNERSHIPS FOCUS ON REAL IMPROVEMENTS FOR LOCAL RESIDENTS. We will give local crime partnerships the responsibility for managing and directing Community Safety Forces. We will also fund the involvement of local police forces in community activities designed to involve ethnic minorities and increase public confidence in all sections of society.  - MAKE THE POLICE MORE ACCOUNTABLE. Public confidence in the police has declined. As well as seeking to improve the visibility of the police and improving police relations with the community, we will create a genuinely independent police complaints system to deal with complaints speedily, efficiently and impartially. We will encourage police forces to be more representative of the communities they serve, and ensure that stop and search is based on intelligence and attaches no relevance to the race or colour of those stopped by the police.  - COMMISSION AN INDEPENDENT REPORT ON THE POLICE RESOURCES THE COUNTRY NEEDS IN THE LONG TERM. We will establish a Standing Conference on Policing comprising representatives of all police ranks, the public and experts in policing issues. This will regularly report to government and parliament, advising on the resources required to provide an effective police presence in every community, and the management of police stations and technology. It will also review the use of police time, in particular that devoted to paperwork and court procedures.  - SUPPORT THE WORK OF EUROPOL, the EU police agency, and the establishment of a European police college, subject to proper democratic oversight. We wish to see police forces working together in the fight against crime, particularly international crimes such as drug trafficking, terrorism, customs fraud, money laundering and the trade in human beings for slave labour or sexual exploitation.     PRISONS  The last Conservative Home Secretary Michael Howard famously said ""prison works"". But half of the people who have served time in Britain's jails go on to reoffend on release. Many prisons are colleges of crime. People incarcerated for minor offences learn how to commit much more serious ones.  Liberal Democrats reject the knee-jerk Conservative approach and Labour's attempts to echo it. We will not be any less tough on crime, but we will be more effective. We will:  - FOCUS RESOURCES ON CRIME PREVENTION RATHER THAN PRISON BUILDING. Prisons are very expensive. There are many more cost-effective ways of reducing crime than ever-longer sentences. We believe that people should be sent to prison if the public need to be protected from them or if this is the only way to punish them effectively. But to release resources for crime prevention and to cut reoffending, we believe there is more scope for the use of community sentences which are proven to work, such as electronic tagging, reparation to victims, fines, drug treatment, and probation orders.  - CUT REOFFENDING BY EX-PRISONERS. Previous governments have concentrated a great deal on sending people to prison, but not nearly enough on what goes on once they are there. We believe that prisoners should put in a full working day in jail. They should also have access to skill training and courses in literacy to equip them for work after release, and be given more support and rehabilitation once they have completed their sentences. We will also use weekend and evening custody to permit some offenders during sentence to enter paid work prior to release.  - MAKE PRISONS MORE EFFECTIVE. We will make minimum levels of education and work, and rehabilitation programmes, central to prison regimes, and set standards expected through Service Delivery Agreements. We will increase the amount of commercial activity undertaken by prison industries. We will also boost the powers of the prison inspectorate so that it can force change, not just report on failure.  In the long term, our goal is to:  - IMPROVE THE SUCCESSFUL RESETTLEMENT OF RELEASED PRISONERS. There should be more use of pre-release assessments of the resettlement needs of prisoners, in particular for the majority who have served sentences, and for whom current arrangements are totally inadequate. The focus of resettlement should be on housing needs, employment and training schemes, and preventing substance misuse.     THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM  Conservative and Labour Governments in turn have attempted to erode the criminal justice system. Labour have been intent on curtailing the right to the fundamental freedom of jury trial, as first proposed by the Conservatives. The Conservatives increased the use of mandatory sentences, taking away judicial discretion to make decisions based appropriately on the facts of an individual case. Liberal Democrats wish to enhance the powers of the courts. We also want to see a greater recognition of the rights of victims of crime. We will:  - GIVE VICTIMS OR THEIR FAMILIES GREATER RIGHTS TO BE HEARD IN COURT. We will give victims the right to be kept fully informed about the progress of the cases with which they are involved. We will also provide opportunities for them to make statements in court about the effect that the crime has had on them after the jury has delivered its verdict and before the judge passes sentence. We will offer victims greater support during the progress of a case. Criminal injury compensation is often inadequate or unavailable and so we will improve the scheme to ensure that the most serious cases receive adequate compensation. We will strengthen support for victims of domestic violence by offering more training in this area to the relevant professionals.  - TACKLE HATE CRIMES. We will establish police hate crime investigation units to coordinate information and action against racist, homophobic and other hate crimes. We will also legislate against hate crimes by widening current legislation to include all hate crimes on the same basis as that existing for racially motivated crime.  - END MANDATORY SENTENCING except for minor offences (such as fixed penalty motoring offences), so that judges and not politicians set sentences.  - RETAIN JURY TRIALS for middle-ranking cases threatened by the Mode of Trial Bill and restore the right to silence.  - ENSURE THAT FOSTERING AND ADOPTION LAW and practice are based on the suitability of individual fosterers and the needs of the child.     In the long term, we will also:  - PROPOSE A NEW WAY OF SENTENCING FOR THE MOST SERIOUS OFFENDERS. We will consult on introducing indefinite sentences for the most serious sex and violent offenders, so that they would only be released following an assessment by the court of the risk which they pose to society.  - CREATE A DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE. This will ensure a separation of powers between the legal system and law enforcement agencies, reform the powers of the Lord Chancellor, and help to provide a fairer system of justice for all. We will establish a review of the legal aid system, to ensure genuine access to justice.  - OVERHAUL THE YOUTH JUSTICE SYSTEM. We will expand reform of the youth justice system to ensure a greater focus on the root causes of misbehaviour, and on education and rehabilitation. We want a greater role for the principles of restorative justice, with offenders meeting their victims, discovering the consequences of their actions and planning to improve their behaviour in the future. Reform would respond not only to the problems caused by child offenders but also to the problems they face. We also favour smaller youth custody units rather than large Young Offender Institutions and would ensure that those young people who must be held are sent to specialised units.        TACKLING THE CAUSES OF CRIME  We recognise that many of the most effective measures against crime are not the responsibility of the police, the prison system or the courts. Our policies in many other areas will have a significant impact on the causes of crime. We will:  - INVEST IN EDUCATION to offer young people more opportunities.  - ENCOURAGE YOUNG PEOPLE INTO CONSTRUCTIVE ACTIVITY by increasing support for sport, recreation and the youth service.  - ENCOURAGE THE USE OF ACCEPTABLE BEHAVIOUR CONTRACTS (ABCS). These will help reduce anti-social behaviour in communities by young people, without resorting to blanket curfews or immediate use of heavy-handed court action through Anti-Social Behaviour Orders.  - EXPAND FACILITIES TO HELP DRUG AND ALCOHOL ABUSERS. We will prioritise funds to aim for a maximum four-week waiting time after an abuser is referred for treatment.  - REPLACE THE NEW DEAL WITH A FLEXIBLE GUARANTEE OF HELP FOR ALL JOBSEEKERS, administered through a combined Benefits and Jobs Agency.  - HELP ENSURE THAT CARE LEAVERS DO NOT DRIFT INTO CRIME by offering them support with housing, education and training.  - ESTABLISH A NATIONAL CRIME REDUCTION AGENCY to oversee and advise on the work of local Crime Reduction Partnerships and other crime reduction work undertaken by central government. This will ensure that those partnerships are effective at finding local solutions to local crime problems.  - ESTABLISH A STANDING ROYAL COMMISSION to tackle the range of problems currently associated with drugs. The approach of successive governments has demonstrably failed. An independent Royal Commission will take a fresh look at the issue of illegal drugs and ways to tackle problems in such areas as health and the huge profits of organised crime. The Commission will also be charged with recommending strategies to address misuse of legal drugs such as alcohol and tobacco, and other legal substances such as solvents.     SETTING YOU FREE  - LIBERALISE LICENSING LAWS. We will replace mandatory closing times for pubs with locally determined opening times.  - MAKE NON-PAYMENT OF TV LICENCES A CIVIL MATTER RATHER THAN A CRIMINAL OFFENCE.  - ABANDON PLANS TO INTRODUCE A PUBLIC DEFENDER SCHEME which would limit the independence of defence advocates.     GREEN ACTION  PREVENTING POLLUTION  We will improve enforcement of pollution controls through an expanded inspectorate for the Environment Agency, to support full implementation of the statutory pollution control regime. This will be reinforced by increasing the level of penalties which polluters have to pay and the introduction of legislation on corporate environmental liability. We will also use these same powers to ensure that biotech companies are liable for any harm caused by GM crops and food.     TRANSPORT  RELIABLE AND SAFE TRANSPORT  A decent transport system is fundamental to an equitable and environmentally sustainable society. We will work to build an integrated transport system throughout the country that is safe, reliable and affordable. Our policies place special emphasis on reducing problems from pollution and congestion.     LIBERAL DEMOCRATS WILL:  - PROVIDE FREE OFF-PEAK LOCAL TRAVEL ON BUSES FOR PENSIONERS AND DISABLED PEOPLE, AND AIM FOR HALF-PRICE TRAVEL AT ALL TIMES FOR UNDER-19S IN FULL TIME EDUCATION  - ABOLISH CAR TAX FOR THOSE WHO DRIVE LESS-POLLUTING VEHICLES  - ESTABLISH STRONGER PUBLIC CONTROL OVER THE RAILWAYS     While progress in other public services in Britain has been disappointingly slow over the past four years, in transport the country has clearly gone backwards. Roads are more congested. Buses are less reliable. Railways are in chaos.  Privatisation of the railways by the Conservatives has been a disaster. Regulation is too lax. Companies do not have the right incentives for long-term investment. The system is fragmented. It is all too easy, when things go wrong, for one firm to pass the buck to another. Safety can be compromised.  Labour has failed to win the case for increased investment in public transport. When the price of petrol went up and revenues from petrol tax consequently soared, the Labour Government should have earmarked the extra revenue specifically for improving public transport. It failed to do so.     REDUCING CONGESTION AND POLLUTION  Many people rely on their car. But it is in everyones interests to reduce pollution to protect the environment and to provide a viable alternative to the car wherever possible. We will:  - REWARD MOTORISTS WHO DRIVE LESS-POLLUTING VEHICLES by reducing car tax (Vehicle Excise Duty) on more environmentally friendly cars and motorcycles  abolishing it altogether for the greenest vehicles. We will fund this by increasing the amount of VED charged on the most polluting vehicles.  - GUARANTEE NOT TO INCREASE THE TAX PER LITRE OF FUEL TAKEN BY THE GOVERNMENT, IN REAL TERMS, IN THE NEXT PARLIAMENT. Should the government receive extra revenue from VAT due to increases in fuel prices, we will use it to ease burdens on the travelling public. Our policies for improving public transport and encouraging less polluting vehicles means that we do not need to increase petrol taxes further in order to meet our environmental objectives.  - INTRODUCE ENVIRONMENTAL INCENTIVES FOR BUS OPERATORS. We will reform fuel duty rebates for bus operators so that these are tied more closely to those running more efficient vehicles, particularly those using alternative fuels.  - REDUCE ROAD TRAFFIC. As part of our policies for reducing pollution and congestion we will introduce legislation to ensure that there are stronger targets for local authorities to reduce road traffic. We will also enable local authorities to raise bonds and establish congestion charging and private non-residential parking taxes to promote use of public transport.  - REDUCE FREIGHT ON THE ROADS THROUGH INCREASED USE OF RAILWAYS AND WATERWAYS. We will explore partnership options for developing Britains waterways (which are vastly under-utilised at present). We also plan to double the amount of freight carried on Britains railways by 2010.     IMPROVING PUBLIC TRANSPORT  Britains public transport system could be the envy of the world. At the moment, however, it is expensive, out of date and decaying. We will:  - EXTEND FREE OFF-PEAK LOCAL TRAVEL ON BUSES to pensioners and people with disabilities. This would extend across the UK the scheme currently operating in London and those being developed in Wales. In addition we aim to introduce a scheme of half-fares at all times for under 19s in full-time education.  - INCREASE INVESTMENT IN PUBLIC TRANSPORT. We will enable local authorities to raise bonds and establish congestion charging and private non-residential parking taxes (including out-of-town retail and workplace parking) to fund improved public transport. Priorities for investment include: reopening disused railway lines and stations; developing bus routes, cycle paths, trams, light rail systems, and walkways; better information for passengers through a National Public Transport Information System; Local Authority sponsored car-pooling schemes; and improving the ease with which passengers are able to transfer between different modes of transport.  - CREATE A RURAL TRANSPORT REGENERATION FUND to improve community transport schemes and public transport in rural areas.  - SUPPORT COMMUNITY TRANSPORT, particularly in rural areas, including dial-a-ride, taxi buses, post buses and school buses, by widening eligibility for the existing fuel duty rebate tied into the emission standards of the vehicle. This will be funded in part by reducing eligibility for fuel duty rebate for commercial tour buses.     IMPROVING TRANSPORT REGULATION AND PERFORMANCE   Much of the public transport system is run by private companies. This provides valuable competition, investment and innovation in the sector. But if it is to deliver everything that passengers deserve, it must be properly regulated. We will:  - REFORM THE REGULATORY SYSTEM FOR PUBLIC TRANSPORT. We will establish a Sustainable Transport Authority (STA) which will take over the functions of the Strategic Rail Authority and the existing Rail Regulator and also have responsibility for oversight of bus and coach operators, trams, ferries, coastal shipping and inland waterways. The STA will work to: upgrade safety, access and quality; enhance the rail network; tackle monopolies, particularly taking immediate and effective action against predatory behaviour in the bus industry; develop through-ticketing and timetable integration; improve the safety and quality of rail and bus stations by introducing a Safer Stations Charter Mark scheme; and ensure refunds for failure to fulfil adequate standards of service, including punctuality.     RAILWAYS AND THE LONDON UNDERGROUND  Britains railways are in chaos. They are a major casualty of many years of neglect and underinvestment by successive governments. We will work to see Railtrack become a not-for-profit, public interest company, and develop the railway system as the backbone of a modern transport system. In addition, we will:  - SECURE INCREASED PUBLIC CONTROL OVER PUBLIC INVESTMENT IN THE RAILWAYS by ensuring the Sustainable Transport Authority (STA) takes responsibility for the allocation of public funds intended for new developments (as distinct from repair and renewal). As part of this we will prioritise modernisation and development of the East and West Coast mainlines, and a new high-speed East Coast mainline between Aberdeen, London and the new Channel Tunnel Rail Link.  - SEEK TO RESTRUCTURE RAILTRACK. We will ask the Competition Commission to review Railtracks activities under a public interest reference so that a suitable restructuring can be imposed on the company. We believe that any changes must simplify the structure of our railway system by using the STA to reduce the number of franchises, and by encouraging Railtrack to pass responsibility for track renewal and repair to the major train operating companies.  - SIMPLIFY REGULATION. We will bring together the role of the Rail Regulator and SRA within the STA. We will also seek to alter the current bureaucratic penalty system into a simpler scheme of incentives. In addition, the range of fares that can only be altered with agreement from the fares regulator (at present the SRA) will be widened. We will create a new independent body within the STA with responsibility for timetabling.  - IMPROVE RAILWAY SAFETY. We will implement the recommendations made by Lord Cullens inquiry into Railway Safety. We will create a new Railway Safety body within the STA to take regulation of railway safety. We will also create an accident investigation body modelled on the Air Accident Investigation Branch.  - MODERNISE THE LONDON UNDERGROUND. We believe that the best way to modernise the Underground, without compromising safety, is through a not-for-profit, public interest company funded through bonds.        ROADS  For many people, roads are the backbone of the countrys transport. But there has been too much focus on building new ones and not enough attention paid to the roads that already exist. We will:  - BOOST THE REPAIR AND MAINTENANCE OF ROADS. We are committed to improving the quality of the existing network, with the safety benefits that this would bring. We will undertake road widening and by-pass schemes only where there are clear safety benefits and where, on balance, there is an environmental benefit.  - ESTABLISH FAIR COMPETITION FOR BRITISH FREIGHT COMPANIES. We will cut significantly freight vehicle excise duty, funding this by introducing a daily charge which includes overseas hauliers who currently escape VED.  - IMPROVE ROAD SAFETY. We will work towards a target of at least a 40% reduction in those killed and seriously injured on the roads by 2010. We will implement a National Programme of Home Zones for residential areas, and Quiet Lanes in rural areas. This will reduce vehicle speeds and make communities safer by giving greater priority to pedestrians and cyclists. We will also strengthen the enforcement of weights and safety standards on the road haulage industry.     AVIATION  Travel by air is growing, raising environmental and safety issues. We will:  - REJECT PRIVATISATION OF NATIONAL AIR TRAFFIC SERVICES creating instead a not-for-profit, public body to protect safety in the air.  - WORK TO REFORM AVIATION FUEL TAXATION. We will work at the European level to ensure that the whole system of aviation fuel taxation is reformed internationally, as part of a longer-term strategy for reducing energy use and pollution through cleaner fuels and more efficient aircraft. We will also press the EU Commission to allow removal of remaining air passenger duty on flights to peripheral and less accessible parts of the UK which rely on air transport.  - RESTRICT NOISY NIGHT FLIGHTS AND AIRPORT EXPANSION. We will ensure that restrictions are imposed on the expansion of night flights where these will have a negative impact upon residential areas. In addition, we will ensure that there are clear rules governing future expansion of airports, strengthening consideration of environmental impacts and safety implications.     SETTING YOU FREE  - CUT RESTRICTIONS ON LOCAL GOVERNMENT WHICH PREVENT COUNCILS FROM RAISING FUNDS TO IMPROVE PUBLIC TRANSPORT AND THE ENVIRONMENT.  GREEN ACTION  PLANNING FOR PUBLIC TRANSPORT  OUR POLICIES ARE DESIGNED TO REDUCE THE NEED TO TRAVEL THROUGH BETTER USE OF THE PLANNING SYSTEM, AND INVESTMENT IN IMPROVING PUBLIC TRANSPORT SO THAT PEOPLE ARE NO LONGER FORCED TO USE THEIR CAR UNNECESSARILY. WE WILL INTRODUCE REGIONAL TRANSPORT PLANS AND STRENGTHEN LOCAL TRANSPORT PLANS TO SET EFFECTIVE STRATEGIES FOR REDUCING CONGESTION, POLLUTION AND TRAFFIC GROWTH.  LESS ROAD BUILDING  WE WILL REVERSE PLANS FOR NEW ROAD BUILDING IN ENVIRONMENTALLY SENSITIVE AREAS.  CLEANER AND MORE EFFICIENT VEHICLES  WE WILL PROMOTE TECHNOLOGIES WHICH IMPROVE VEHICLE EFFICIENCY AND THE USE OF ALTERNATIVE FUEL SYSTEMS SUCH AS LIQUEFIED PETROLEUM GAS, AND, IN THE LONGER TERM, BIOFUELS AND ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES. IN ADDITION, WE WILL IMPROVE TESTING OF VEHICLE EMISSIONS AND STRICTLY ENFORCE FREIGHT VEHICLE WEIGHT LIMITS AND OTHER SAFETY STANDARDS BY INCREASING RESOURCES DEVOTED TO ROADSIDE TESTING AS WELL AS STRENGTHENING THE MOT TEST. WE WILL OPPOSE FURTHER INCREASES IN WEIGHT LIMITS FOR FREIGHT VEHICLES.  PENSIONS, WAGES AND BENEFITS  FREEDOM FROM POVERTY  POVERTY RESTRICTS FREEDOM BECAUSE PEOPLE WITHOUT A DECENT INCOME DO NOT HAVE THE OPPORTUNITIES ENJOYED BY OTHERS. MORE NEEDS TO BE DONE FOR PENSIONERS AND THOSE WITH LOW INCOMES TO ENSURE THAT ALL IN BRITAIN HAVE A BETTER QUALITY OF LIFE.     LIBERAL DEMOCRATS WILL:  - BOOST THE BASIC STATE PENSION, PARTICULARLY FOR THE OVER-75S  - SUPPORT DISABLED PEOPLE BY EXTENDING WINTER FUEL ALLOWANCE PAYMENTS TO THE SEVERELY DISABLED  - HELP THE LOWER PAID BY AIMING TO REDUCE TAXATION FOR POORER TAXPAYERS  - PROTECT WORKERS ON LOW INCOMES BY REVIEWING THE MINIMUM WAGE ANNUALLY  - TACKLE CHILD POVERTY WITH EXTRA MONEY FOR FAMILIES ON LONG-TERM INCOME SUPPORT  IT IS A GREAT INDICTMENT OF THE GOVERNMENTS OF MARGARET THATCHER, JOHN MAJOR AND TONY BLAIR THAT ALL OF THEM ALLOWED THE GAP BETWEEN RICH AND POOR PEOPLE IN BRITAIN TO BECOME WIDER THAN BEFORE. THE BLAIR GOVERNMENT HAS TAKEN A DISAPPOINTINGLY MEAN-SPIRITED APPROACH TOWARDS PENSIONERS AND LONE PARENTS IN PARTICULAR.  WE RECOGNISE THAT THERE ARE MANY THEATRES IN THE WAR AGAINST POVERTY. OUR SUCCESS IN TACKLING POVERTY IN BRITAIN WOULD BE MEASURED BY A QUALITY OF LIFE INDEX. THIS WOULD INCLUDE A STATEMENT OF THE STANDARDS WHICH A CITIZEN OF THE UK MIGHT REASONABLY EXPECT TO ENJOY IN ORDER TO PARTICIPATE FULLY IN SOCIETY AND HAVE A DECENT QUALITY OF LIFE.           PENSIONS  BRITAIN'S PENSIONERS HAVE NOT FORGOTTEN THE MISERLINESS OF THE 75P INCREASE THEY WERE ALLOWED LAST YEAR. UNDER FIRST THE CONSERVATIVES AND NOW LABOUR, THE REAL VALUE OF STATE PENSIONS HAS FALLEN FURTHER AND FURTHER. ELDERLY PEOPLE REQUIRE BOTH AN IMMEDIATE SUBSTANTIAL BOOST TO THEIR INCOMES AND A GUARANTEE THAT THEIR INTERESTS WILL ALWAYS BE CONSIDERED NOT JUST IN THE RUN-UP TO GENERAL ELECTIONS.  UNDER LABOUR, THERE HAS BEEN A BIG INCREASE IN MEANS-TESTING FOR PENSIONERS. MANY ELDERLY PEOPLE ARE TOO PROUD TO CLAIM MONEY WHICH IS DUE TO THEM. IT IS QUITE POSSIBLE TO TARGET THE POOREST PEOPLE IN SOCIETY WITHOUT RESORTING TO MEANS TESTS.  LIBERAL DEMOCRATS WILL:  - INCREASE THE BASIC STATE PENSION BY £5 A WEEK FOR EACH SINGLE PENSIONER, £10 FOR THE OVER-75S AND £15 FOR THE OVER-80S. COUPLES WILL RECEIVE £8, £18 AND £28 RESPECTIVELY. WE WILL GIVE THE MOST TO OLDER PENSIONERS BECAUSE THEY ARE AMONGST THE POOREST AND NEEDIEST PEOPLE IN THE COUNTRY. FOR THE PAST THIRTY YEARS, THEY HAVE RECEIVED A DERISORY 25P A WEEK AT 80 OVER AND ABOVE THE BASIC PENSION. WE WILL ALSO REWARD PENSIONERS WHO HAVE SAVED THROUGHOUT THEIR LIVES BY SCRAPPING THE RULES WHICH DENY HELP TO PEOPLE WITH SAVINGS ABOVE £12,000.  - FUND OUR BIG INCREASES IN PENSIONS BY SETTING A NEW TOP TAX RATE OF 50P ON INCOME OVER £100,000 A YEAR. TO PUT THIS MEASURE INTO PERSPECTIVE, FOR MOST OF THE THATCHER YEARS, THE TOP RATE WAS 60P STARTING ON SUBSTANTIALLY LOWER INCOMES.  - ESTABLISH AN INDEPENDENT PENSIONS AUTHORITY. TO GUARANTEE THAT PENSIONERS DO NOT FALL BEHIND THE REST OF THE POPULATION, THE AUTHORITY WILL REPORT ANNUALLY TO THE GOVERNMENT ON AN APPROPRIATE UPRATING FOR THE STATE PENSION. IT WILL TAKE INTO ACCOUNT LEVELS OF PENSIONER POVERTY, THE GROWTH IN EARNINGS AND NATIONAL INCOME AND AFFORDABILITY. WE WILL ALSO ESTABLISH A MORE STABLE ENVIRONMENT FOR PENSION PLANNING BY SEEKING TO SECURE ALL-PARTY CONSENSUS BEFORE MAKING FUTURE PENSION REFORMS.  - STRENGTHEN THE POSITION OF PEOPLE WITH PRIVATE PENSIONS BY ENSURING THAT MEMBERS OF COMPANY PENSION SCHEMES, INCLUDING RETIRED MEMBERS, HAVE A GREATER SAY OVER THE USE OF THEIR PENSION FUND. WE WILL ALSO RELAX CURRENT RULES WHICH REQUIRE PEOPLE WITH PERSONAL PENSIONS TO BUY AN ANNUITY ON OR BEFORE THEIR 75TH BIRTHDAY.  IN THE LONG TERM, OUR GOAL IS TO:  - INTRODUCE A NEW OWNED SECOND PENSION ACCOUNT. WE BELIEVE THAT THE BEST WAY TO PREVENT POVERTY AMONG FUTURE GENERATIONS IS TO ENSURE THAT ALL PEOPLE HAVE A SECOND PENSION OF THEIR OWN TO TOP UP THE STATE PENSION. OVER TIME WE WOULD ENSURE THAT A GROWING PROPORTION OF THE WORKFORCE WERE MEMBERS EITHER OF A COMPANY PENSION SCHEME OR HAD AN OWNED SECOND PENSION ACCOUNT, WITH THE GOVERNMENT MAKING CONTRIBUTIONS FOR THOSE WHO BECAUSE OF ILL HEALTH, UNEMPLOYMENT OR CARING RESPONSIBILITIES ARE TOO POOR TO DO SO.  - EXTEND THE ENTITLEMENT TO THE BASIC STATE PENSION TO ALL CITIZENS. PEOPLE WOULD NO LONGER HAVE TO SHOW A HISTORY OF CONTRIBUTIONS IN ORDER TO CLAIM THEIR BASIC PENSION. THIS WOULD EVENTUALLY HELP AROUND 3.4 MILLION PEOPLE, MAINLY WOMEN, CARERS AND LONG-TERM DISABLED PEOPLE.     LOW PAY AND BENEFITS  THERE IS A GREAT DEAL OF TALK ABOUT SCROUNGERS ON THE WELFARE STATE. LIBERAL DEMOCRATS WILL BE VIGILANT AGAINST THOSE WHO SEEK TO CHEAT THE SYSTEM. EQUALLY, THERE ARE MANY PEOPLE IN BRITAIN WHO ARE IN NEED WHO HAVE TO DEPEND ON THE STATE. AMONG THEM ARE LOW-PAID WORKERS WITH FAMILIES, LONE PARENTS AND CHILDREN. WE WILL:  - PROTECT WORKERS ON LOW INCOMES BY REVIEWING THE NATIONAL MINIMUM WAGE ANNUALLY ON THE BASIS OF RECOMMENDATIONS FROM THE LOW PAY COMMISSION. THE MINIMUM WAGE HAS PROVED AN EFFECTIVE WAY OF PROTECTING WORKERS ON LOW INCOMES, WITHOUT CAUSING DAMAGE TO BUSINESS. WE BELIEVE IT IS WRONG TO SET A LOWER RATE MINIMUM WAGE FOR WORKERS UNDER 21. WE WILL SET THE SAME RATE FOR ALL PEOPLE AGED 16 AND OVER.  - ALLEVIATE CHILD POVERTY BY PAYING AN ADDITIONAL £200 PER YEAR TO ALL FAMILIES WITH CHILDREN WHO HAVE BEEN ON INCOME SUPPORT FOR MORE THAN A YEAR. SUCH CHILDREN SUFFER FROM THE POVERTY THEIR PARENTS FIND THEMSELVES IN. WE WILL ALSO ABOLISH THE CHILD SUPPORT AGENCY, WHICH HAS CAUSED UNJUSTIFIABLE HARDSHIP TO SO MANY PEOPLE, AND REPLACE IT WITH A SYSTEM OF FAMILY COURTS. THEIR MAINTENANCE ASSESSMENTS WILL BE STRONGLY ENFORCED AND WILL SUPPLANT THE ROUGH JUSTICE OF THE CURRENT CRUDE AND SIMPLISTIC FORMULA.  - SUPPORT YOUNG PEOPLE AND REDUCE HOMELESSNESS BY RESTORING 16 AND 17 YEAR-OLDS ENTITLEMENTS TO BENEFITS AND BY INCREASING HOUSING BENEFIT FOR THE UNDER-25S BY ENDING THE SINGLE ROOM RENT RESTRICTION WHICH EFFECTIVELY REQUIRES THEM TO SHARE ACCOMMODATION.  - PROVIDE MORE SUPPORT FOR DISABLED PEOPLE. WE WILL SUPPORT SEVERELY DISABLED PEOPLE BY BRINGING THEM WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THE WINTER FUEL PAYMENT SYSTEM. WE ALSO BELIEVE THAT THE BENEFITS SYSTEM SHOULD RECOGNISE WHAT DISABLED PEOPLE CAN DO RATHER THAN REQUIRING THEM TO PROVE WHAT THEY CANNOT. IN PARTICULAR, WE WILL INVESTIGATE THE FEASIBILITY OF INTRODUCING A PARTIAL CAPACITY BENEFIT FOR THOSE ABLE TO DO SOME WORK.  - SIMPLIFY HOUSING BENEFIT ADMINISTRATION AND REDUCE THE SCOPE FOR BENEFIT FRAUD BY REQUIRING ALL LOCAL AUTHORITIES TO ADOPT EFFECTIVE ANTI-FRAUD STRATEGIES.  - END DISCRIMINATION IN GAS, WATER AND ELECTRICITY CHARGES ENCOURAGING THE REGULATOR TO OFFER A WIDER TARIFF CHOICE WHICH HELPS THE POOREST PEOPLE IN SOCIETY. AT THE MOMENT, FOR INSTANCE, HOUSEHOLDS WHICH USE PRE-PAYMENT METERS END UP PAYING HIGHER RATES THAN OTHER USERS. WE WILL ALSO SEEK TO HAVE STANDING CHARGES REPLACED WITH A BANDED SYSTEM OF CHARGING TO PROTECT POOR HOUSEHOLDS AND ENCOURAGE HIGH USERS TO CONSERVE ENERGY.  - MAKE COLD WEATHER PAYMENTS TO PEOPLE RECEIVING INCOME SUPPORT MORE EFFECTIVE BY ENSURING THAT THEY TAKE ACCOUNT OF WIND CHILL WHICH IS CURRENTLY OVERLOOKED. WE WILL ALSO SEEK TO TAKE PROPER ACCOUNT OF LOCAL WEATHER CONDITIONS.  IN THE LONG TERM, OUR GOAL IS TO:  - REMOVE TAXATION FOR THE LOWEST PAID. WE BELIEVE THAT PEOPLE START PAYING TAX AT TOO LOW A LEVEL AND WILL WORK TO REDUCE THE BURDEN OF TAXATION ON THE LOW PAID. OVER TIME, WE WILL CUT THE 10P TAX RATE TO ZERO SO NOBODY PAYS ANY TAX ON THEIR EARNINGS UP TO £6,500. AT PRESENT, THIS WOULD TAKE 1.4 MILLION PEOPLE ON LOW INCOMES (1.1 MILLION OF WHOM ARE WOMEN) OUT OF TAX ALTOGETHER. ANYONE EARNING LESS THAN £25,000 WOULD PAY LESS TAX  EVEN ALLOWING FOR OUR 1P FOR EDUCATION.  - ESTABLISH A MINIMUM INCOME STANDARD AFTER CARRYING OUT RESEARCH TO ESTABLISH THE APPROPRIATE AMOUNT.  - MAKE THE SOCIAL FUND MORE EFFECTIVE BY SHIFTING THE BALANCE FROM DISCRETIONARY LOANS TO GRANTS.     SETTING YOU FREE  - ABOLISH THE BENEFIT SANCTIONS WHICH WERE BROUGHT IN UNDER THE NEW DEAL. THESE HAVE PLACED HARSH BURDENS ON POOR PEOPLE AND IN MANY CASES, THE CHILDREN OF THOSE PENALISED ARE THE ONES WHO SUFFER THE MOST. WE WILL NOT IMPOSE FURTHER PENALTIES UNTIL THE EFFECTS OF PENALTIES HAVE BEEN EVALUATED.     GREEN ACTION  ERADICATING FUEL POVERTY  OUR HOMES INSULATION PROGRAMME, TO PROVIDE DECENT LEVELS OF HOME INSULATION WITHIN 15 YEARS BY SPEEDING UP THE CURRENT 30-YEAR PROGRAMME FUNDED BY THE ENERGY UTILITIES, WILL ALSO CUT FUEL BILLS. THIS WILL BE ACHIEVED THROUGH A TARGETED PROGRAMME OF INVESTMENT FUNDED BY THE ENERGY SAVINGS TRUST AND THE ENERGY SUPPLY COMPANIES. WE WILL WORK WITH COLLEAGUES IN EUROPE TO AGREE ZERO-RATING OF VAT ON ALL ENERGY CONSERVATION MATERIALS WITHIN THE EU. WE WILL CUT FUEL BILLS AND REDUCE POLLUTION BY REQUIRING ALL NEW HOUSING TO MEET IMPROVED ENERGY AND WATER EFFICIENCY STANDARDS THROUGH THE USE OF ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY BUILDING MATERIALS AND TECHNIQUES.     INNOVATION IN CULTURE, ARTS AND SPORT  OPPORTUNITIES FOR EVERYONE  EVERYONE SHOULD HAVE A FREEDOM TO EXPLORE THEIR TALENTS AND EXPERIENCE THE TALENTS OF OTHERS. THE ARTS AND SPORT MAKE A HUGE CONTRIBUTION TO OUR SOCIETY. THEY PLAY AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN BOTH EDUCATION AND THE ECONOMY AND ARE A MEANS OF PROMOTING SOCIAL INCLUSION.  LIBERAL DEMOCRATS WILL:  - PLACE THE ARTS AT THE HEART OF SCHOOL EDUCATION  - SUPPORT COMMUNITY SPORTS PLANS  - PROMOTE DIVERSITY IN CULTURE, THE ARTS AND SPORT     ARTS AND CULTURE  RECENT GOVERNMENTS HAVE NOT GIVEN THE ARTS AND SPORT THE PRIORITY WHICH THEY DESERVE. OUR GOAL IS TO MAKE A SUBSTANTIAL INCREASE IN INVESTMENT IN THE ARTS TO ENHANCE PUBLIC ACCESS, PERFORMANCE OPPORTUNITIES AND ARTISTIC INNOVATION. WE WILL:  - GIVE ALL PUPILS AN ENTITLEMENT TO ARTS EDUCATION THROUGHOUT THEIR SCHOOL CAREERS. WE WILL RECRUIT AND TRAIN MORE SPECIALIST ART TEACHERS AND ENSURE THAT ALL PRIMARY TEACHERS ARE WELL TRAINED IN THE ARTS. WE WILL RESTORE FUNDING FOR FREE INSTRUMENTAL TUITION TO AT LEAST 1990 LEVELS, GIVING MANY MORE PUPILS THE CHANCE TO LEARN AN INSTRUMENT ONCE AGAIN.  - PROTECT OUR CULTURAL HERITAGE BY LOWERING THE COST OF MAINTAINING LISTED BUILDINGS. WE WILL DO THIS BY CUTTING VAT ON RENOVATION AND REPAIRS, PAID FOR BY INTRODUCING VAT, AT THE SAME LOW LEVEL, ON NEW BUILDING.  - ENCOURAGE ARTISTS AND ARTISTIC DIVERSITY. WE WILL SUPPORT ARTISTS BY MAINTAINING THE SUPPORT PROVIDED BY SCHEDULE D TAXATION. WE WILL ESTABLISH A FUND TO BRING ARTISTS TO SCHOOLS, HOSPITALS AND PRISONS.  - INCREASE THE POWERS OF REGIONAL ARTS BOARDS. WE WILL DEVOLVE ALL FUNDING DECISIONS, EXCEPT THOSE INVOLVING NATIONAL COMPANIES, FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF CULTURE MEDIA AND SPORT TO THE REGIONAL ARTS BOARDS.  - DEVELOP THE USE OF LIBRARIES BY MAKING THEM CENTRES FOR FREE INTERNET ACCESS.  - INVEST IN LOCAL LIBRARIES, ARTS AND MUSEUMS BY REPLACING THE MILLENNIUM COMMISSION WITH A LOCAL INITIATIVES FUND WHICH WOULD GIVE GRANTS TO SUPPORT LIBRARIES, MUSEUMS AND GALLERIES IN COMMUNITIES ACROSS BRITAIN. WE WILL RESTORE THE PRINCIPLE THAT LOTTERY CASH SHOULD NOT FUND SERVICES MORE PROPERLY PROVIDED THROUGH TAXATION, AND ENSURE THAT ALL LOTTERY MONEY GOES TO THE ARTS, CHARITY, SPORT, HERITAGE AND LOCAL CULTURAL INSTITUTIONS.        BROADCASTING  HIGH-QUALITY TELEVISION AND RADIO ARE ESSENTIAL COMPONENTS OF A MODERN DEMOCRACY AND OF A MODERN CIVILISED SOCIETY. BUT AS MEDIA OUTLETS MULTIPLY, THE CURRENT SYSTEM OF REGULATION IS INCREASINGLY INEFFECTIVE. THIS IS EXACERBATED BY THE COMPLICATED AND OFTEN OVERLAPPING ROLES OF MANY DIFFERENT REGULATORS. WE WILL:  - CREATE A SINGLE OFFICE OF COMMUNICATIONS (OFCOM) WITH THE FLEXIBILITY TO REGULATE EMERGING COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGIES AND ENSURE SERVICE PROVISION ACROSS THE COUNTRY.  - REDEFINE PUBLIC SERVICE BROADCASTING INCLUDING BREADTH AND QUALITY OF OUTPUT, DISTINCT REGIONAL OUTPUT AND FREE-TO-AIR STATUS. OFCOM WOULD ENSURE THAT THESE STANDARDS ARE MAINTAINED INTO THE FUTURE. CHANNELS COULD APPLY TO BE DESIGNATED PUBLIC SERVICE BROADCASTERS, REGULATED BY OFCOM, WHICH WOULD THEN GUARANTEE THEM THE RIGHT TO BE CARRIED ON ALL PLATFORMS ON A PROFIT-FREE BASIS.  - GUARANTEE THE EDITORIAL INDEPENDENCE OF THE BBC, ABOLISHING THE GOVERNMENT APPOINTED BOARD OF GOVERNORS, AND REQUIRING OFCOM TO RECOMMEND A NEW STRUCTURE FOR RUNNING THE BBC, BUT REQUIRING FINANCIAL ACCOUNTABILITY THROUGH THE NATIONAL AUDIT OFFICE.  - CREATE AN ADDITIONAL TV WATERSHED AT 11PM SO THAT PROGRAMMES HIGHLY UNSUITABLE FOR CHILDREN COULD NOT BE BROADCAST UNTIL AT LEAST TWO HOURS AFTER THE EXISTING 9PM WATERSHED.  - SIMPLIFY BUT TIGHTEN RULES GOVERNING CROSS-MEDIA OWNERSHIP TO ENSURE IT IS NOT CONCENTRATED IN THE HANDS OF TOO FEW.     SPORT  SPORT PLAYS AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN OUR AIM OF RAISING THE OVERALL QUALITY OF LIFE OF ALL THE COUNTRYS CITIZENS. PARTICIPATION IN SPORT RAISES LEVELS OF FITNESS AND HEALTH, AND HELPS TO FOSTER LOCAL AND NATIONAL PRIDE. WE WILL:  - PROMOTE COMMUNITY SPORTS PLANS. THESE WILL STIMULATE LOCAL AUTHORITIES, SCHOOLS AND SPORTS CLUBS TO SHARE FACILITIES, WHICH THEY LACK DUE TO SCHOOL FIELDS BEING SOLD OFF, AND INCLUDE PROVISIONS TO SUPPORT SO-CALLED MINORITY SPORTS.  - DEVELOP SPORT IN SCHOOLS. OUR SIMPLER MINIMUM CURRICULUM ENTITLEMENT REPLACING THE NATIONAL CURRICULUM WILL ALLOW GREATER PROVISION OF SPORT AND PHYSICAL EDUCATION IN SCHOOLS.  SETTING YOU FREE  - STREAMLINE GOVERNMENT INVOLVEMENT IN THE ARTS BY ABOLISHING QUEST (QUALITY, EFFICIENCY AND STANDARDS TEAM).  - REDUCE INTERFERENCE BY CENTRAL GOVERNMENT IN CULTURE AND ARTS BY DECENTRALISING DECISION-MAKING POWERS AND FUNDING IN ENGLAND IN ORDER TO PROMOTE COMMUNITY INVOLVEMENT IN THE ARTS. WE WILL ALSO PROTECT THE INDEPENDENCE OF TRUSTEES OF MUSEUMS AND GALLERIES.  - REMOVE THE ANOMALY OF HOME OFFICE REGULATION OF FILM AND VIDEO. WE WILL PASS THIS RESPONSIBILITY TO THE DEPARTMENT OF CULTURE, MEDIA AND SPORT, WHICH OVERSEES ALL CREATIVE INDUSTRIES.     GREEN ACTION  BRING ART AND SPORT TO THE CENTRE OF COMMUNITIES  OUR COMMUNITY ARTS AND SPORTS FUND, ALONGSIDE OUR PLANS TO CUT VAT ON RENOVATION AND REDEVELOPMENT WILL HELP WITH THE COST OF RESTORING AND DEVELOPING SUSTAINABLE ARTS AND SPORTS FACILITIES WITHIN LOCAL COMMUNITIES WHERE THEY ARE EASILY ACCESSIBLE.     BUSINESS, CONSUMERS AND INNOVATION  PROTECTING CONSUMERS  AND BACKING BUSINESS  LIBERAL DEMOCRATS ARE COMMITTED TO A FREE MARKET ECONOMY IN WHICH ENTERPRISE THRIVES. COMPETITION AND OPEN MARKETS ARE BY FAR THE BEST GUARANTEE OF WEALTH CREATION. IT IS THE GOVERNMENT'S ROLE TO ENSURE THE CONDITIONS UNDER WHICH INNOVATION AND COMPETITION CAN FLOURISH AND BENEFIT THE GREATEST NUMBER OF PEOPLE.  LIBERAL DEMOCRATS WILL:  - EASE THE BURDENS ON BUSINESS  - DEFEND CONSUMERS AGAINST THE POWER OF MONOPOLIES  - PROMOTE INNOVATION AND TRAINING IN NEW TECHNOLOGY     THE UK NOW OPERATES IN A GLOBAL MARKET IN WHICH INTERNATIONAL COMPETITION IS INTENSE. LIBERAL DEMOCRATS SOCIAL OBJECTIVES CANNOT BE ACHIEVED WITHOUT THE CREATION OF WEALTH AND THE PROMOTION OF ENTERPRISE. THE CONSERVATIVES HAVE ALWAYS POSED AS THE CHAMPIONS OF ENTERPRISE. BUT TOO OFTEN THEY HAVE IN FACT DEFENDED VESTED INTERESTS AND MONOPOLY POWER. LABOUR HAS OVER-REGULATED IN SOME AREAS AND UNDER-REGULATED IN OTHERS. NEITHER PARTY HAS REALLY BACKED NEW ENTERPRISE AND NEW IDEAS. SMALL BUSINESSES HAVE TO DEAL WITH AN AVALANCHE OF RED TAPE, WHILE THE UTILITY AND RAILWAY COMPANIES HAVE BEEN ALLOWED TO GET AWAY WITH FAR TOO MUCH.  LIBERAL DEMOCRATS SEEK TO ENCOURAGE INNOVATION AND RISK-TAKING, PROTECT THE RIGHTS OF CONSUMERS AND WORKERS, AND SAFEGUARD THE ENVIRONMENT. WE ALSO WANT TO MAINTAIN THE CITY OF LONDONS PRE-EMINENCE AS AN INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL CENTRE.     BUSINESS  BUSINESS PEOPLE WANT TO GET ON WITH RUNNING THEIR COMPANIES, CREATING WEALTH AND PROVIDING MORE OPPORTUNITIES FOR THEIR STAFF. THEY SHOULD NOT HAVE TO SPEND LARGE AMOUNTS OF THEIR TIME ACTING AS AGENTS FOR THE GOVERNMENT, COPING WITH INTERMINABLE REGULATIONS AND FILLING IN ENDLESS FORMS. WE WILL:  - SCRAP UNNECESSARY BUSINESS REGULATIONS. WE HAVE PUBLISHED A LIST OF 25 SPECIFIC MAJOR REGULATIONS WHICH WE WILL SCRAP. WE BELIEVE ANY NEW REGULATIONS SHOULD BE SUBJECT TO A ""SUNSET CLAUSE"", SETTING A DEADLINE AFTER WHICH THEY WOULD AUTOMATICALLY LAPSE. WE WILL ALSO CONSULT BUSINESS BEFORE INTRODUCING ANY NEW MEASURES.  - CUT BUSINESS RATES ON SMALL BUSINESSES BY INTRODUCING A BUSINESS RATES ALLOWANCE, SIMILAR TO PERSONAL TAX ALLOWANCES. THIS TAX-FREE ALLOWANCE WOULD BE SET AT £1500 AND APPLY TO ALL SMALL BUSINESSES. WITH LARGER BUSINESSES PAYING A LITTLE MORE TO COVER THE COST OF THE SCHEME, SMALLER BUSINESSES WILL PAY LESS.  - PROMOTE DIVERSITY OF OWNERSHIP. WE WILL INITIATE A REVIEW OF POLICY GOVERNING MUTUAL OWNERSHIP OF BUILDING SOCIETIES, INSURANCE COMPANIES AND CREDIT UNIONS TO ENCOURAGE AND DEVELOP THEM. WE WILL ALSO REVIEW LEGISLATION IN ORDER TO STIMULATE EMPLOYEE SHARE OWNERSHIP AND COOPERATIVES.  - INVEST IN A KNOWLEDGE-BASED ECONOMY THROUGH RESEARCH. SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH IS THE CORNERSTONE TO A SUCCESSFUL KNOWLEDGE-BASED ECONOMY. WE WELCOME THE EXTRA RESOURCES THE SECTOR HAS ALREADY SEEN AS A RESULT OF PARTNERSHIP WITH CHARITIES AND WILL FURTHER THIS BY INCREASING GOVERNMENT INVESTMENT IN SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH, PAID FOR BY STOPPING TAXPAYERS MONEY BEING USED TO HELP FINANCE ARMS EXPORTS. WE WOULD GIVE PRIORITY TO RESEARCH ON CLIMATE CHANGE MITIGATION AND CLEANER PRODUCTION AND CONSUMPTION TECHNIQUES, AND SET UP AN ACADEMY OF BRITISH INVENTION. THIS WILL BE FUNDED BY STOPPING THE EXPORT CREDIT GUARANTEE DEPARTMENT USING TAXPAYERS' MONEY TO SUPPORT ARMS EXPORTS.  - ENCOURAGE ETHICAL BUSINESS PRACTICE. WE WANT THE UK TO PLAY A LEADING ROLE IN SEEING THE OECD ANTI-BRIBERY CONVENTION IMPLEMENTED WORLD-WIDE. WE WILL ENCOURAGE ETHICAL SHAREHOLDING BY REFORMING CORPORATE GOVERNANCE TO ENHANCE STAKEHOLDERS' RIGHTS. WE WILL REQUIRE THE LARGEST COMPANIES TO REPORT ON THEIR SOCIAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE.  - ENCOURAGE INNOVATION BY MEASURES INCLUDING PROMOTING LINKS BETWEEN ACADEMIC AND INDUSTRIAL RESEARCH AND STRENGTHENING THE ROLES OF LOCAL AND REGIONAL AUTHORITIES TO STIMULATE DEVELOPMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION.  CONSUMERS  CONSUMERS SHOULD HAVE AS MUCH CHOICE AS POSSIBLE, BUT MORE AND MORE OWNERSHIP IS CONCENTRATED IN THE HANDS OF FEWER AND FEWER COMPANIES. THIS HAS BEEN PARTICULARLY TRUE IN FIELDS LIKE BANKING, TELECOMMUNICATIONS, BROADCASTING AND CIVIL AVIATION. ELSEWHERE, LARGE CONCERNS HAVE BEEN DRIVING SMALL BUSINESSES TO THE WALL. WE INTEND TO LEVEL THE PLAYING FIELD TO SUPPORT COMPETITION AND SMALLER BUSINESSES, AND GIVE CONSUMERS MORE PROTECTION AGAINST POOR SERVICE AND FAULTY GOODS. WE WILL:  - INTRODUCE TOUGH LEGISLATION TO CONTROL MONOPOLIES AND CARTELS WITH A PRESUMPTION AGAINST A HIGH CONCENTRATION OF OWNERSHIP. EVEN IN APPARENTLY COMPETITIVE MARKETS, ANTI-COMPETITIVE BEHAVIOUR IS CREATING LOCALISED MONOPOLIES WHERE, FOR EXAMPLE, SUPERMARKETS, LARGE NEWSAGENTS AND OIL COMPANIES HAVE AN UNFAIR ADVANTAGE OVER SMALL SHOPS AND INDEPENDENTS. WE WILL STRENGTHEN THE POWERS OF THE COMPETITION AUTHORITIES TO TACKLE LOCALISED MONOPOLIES.  - STRENGTHEN CONSUMER PROTECTION. WE WILL INTRODUCE NEW SAFEGUARDS FOR PEOPLE TAKING OUT MORTGAGES AND REQUIRE WORKMANSHIP GUARANTEES IN RESPECT OF COWBOY BUILDERS AND GARAGES. WE WILL ALSO INTRODUCE TOUGHER PENALTIES AGAINST COUNTERFEITERS TO PROTECT THE PUBLIC FROM DANGEROUS AND SHODDY GOODS.  - TIGHTEN CONTROLS ON BANKS. WE WILL MAKE IT A LEGAL REQUIREMENT FOR BANKS TO LOOK AFTER THE INTERESTS OF VULNERABLE CUSTOMERS, PARTICULARLY ELDERLY AND DISABLED PEOPLE, THOSE ON LOW INCOMES AND THOSE WHO LIVE IN REMOTE COMMUNITIES. WE WILL APPLY FULL COMPETITION LAW TO BANKS, REFER BANK MERGERS TO THE COMPETITION COMMISSION, PROHIBIT ANTI-COMPETITIVE CASH MACHINE CHARGES AND REGULATE THE CLEARANCE SYSTEM.  - REVIEW REGULATION OF THE LIFE INSURANCE SECTOR IN THE LIGHT OF RECENT EVENTS AT EQUITABLE LIFE AND ELSEWHERE, TO PROTECT THE SAVINGS AND PENSIONS OF MILLIONS OF PEOPLE.  - ESTABLISH A UNIVERSAL SERVICE OBLIGATION FOR THE POST OFFICE BRANCH NETWORK. POST OFFICES ARE A VITAL PART OF ALL COMMUNITIES, PARTICULARLY THE MORE ISOLATED ONES. WE WILL ENSURE THAT SUB-POST OFFICES CONTINUE TO OFFER THE SERVICES WHICH THEIR CUSTOMERS NEED.  EMPLOYEES' RIGHTS  MOST EMPLOYERS HAVE NO OBJECTION TO GOOD HEALTH, SAFETY AND ANTI-DISCRIMINATION RULES. BUT THE LAW NEEDS TO BE TIGHTENED TO CLAMP DOWN ON THE SMALL MINORITY OF COMPANIES WHO EXPLOIT THEIR WORKFORCE. WE WILL PROMOTE A BUSINESS CULTURE WHICH EMBRACES EQUAL OPPORTUNITY AS ESSENTIAL TO A COMMITTED AND MOTIVATED WORKFORCE. WE WILL:  - GIVE THE HEALTH AND SAFETY EXECUTIVE NEW POWERS TO INVESTIGATE BREACHES OF ITS RULES. WE WILL MAKE BUSINESSES WHICH FLAGRANTLY FLOUT THE RULES CRIMINALLY LIABLE FOR THE CONSEQUENCES. HOWEVER, WE WILL TRAIN INSPECTORS TO CARRY OUT A RANGE OF INSPECTIONS ON ONE VISIT WHERE POSSIBLE, RATHER THAN HAVING SEVERAL SEPARATE INSPECTIONS FROM DIFFERENT BODIES.  - FIGHT AGE DISCRIMINATION BY BANNING COMPULSORY RETIREMENT AGES. INSTEAD, WE WILL PROVIDE FOR INDIVIDUALS AGED 60 AND OVER WHO WISH TO WORK TO HAVE AN ASSESSMENT OF THEIR ABILITY TO CONTINUE THEIR JOB AS PART OF AN ANNUAL APPRAISAL PROCESS.  - REVIEW THE MINIMUM WAGE ANNUALLY. THE REVIEW WILL FOLLOW THE RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE LOW PAY COMMISSION. EQUAL WORK DESERVES EQUAL PAY, SO WE WILL ALSO EXTEND THE FULL MINIMUM WAGE TO ALL THOSE AGED 16 AND OVER, ABOLISHING THE LOWER RATE PAID TO PEOPLE UNDER 21.  - PROMOTE CONSULTATION OF EMPLOYEES. WE BELIEVE THAT WORKERS SHOULD HAVE A STATUTORY RIGHT TO CONSULTATION OVER KEY BUSINESS DECISIONS AFFECTING THEIR FUTURE, SUCH AS FACTORY CLOSURES.     SETTING YOU FREE  - END UNNECESSARY REGULATION. WE WILL RELIEVE BUSINESSES OF TASKS WHICH THEY UNNECESSARILY PERFORM ON BEHALF OF THE GOVERNMENT, LIKE ADMINISTERING WORKING FAMILIES TAX CREDIT, AND COLLECTING STUDENT LOANS.  - LIBERALISE SUNDAY TRADING LAWS. WE WILL MAKE SUNDAY OPENING HOURS A MATTER FOR LOCAL COUNCILS RATHER THAN FOR NATIONAL GOVERNMENT, WITHIN A NATIONAL FRAMEWORK TO GUARANTEE EXTRA PAY FOR SUNDAY WORK AND PROTECT CONSCIENTIOUS OBJECTION TO SUNDAY WORKING.     GREEN ACTION  CUTTING POLLUTION FROM ENERGY USE  THE BURNING OF FOSSIL FUELS  COAL, OIL AND GAS  IS A MAJOR CONTRIBUTOR TO CLIMATE CHANGE, AND ALSO CAUSES ACID RAIN AND LOCAL AIR POLLUTION. OUR TOP PRIORITIES ARE TO REDUCE ENERGY CONSUMPTION OVERALL, BY IMPROVING THE EFFICIENCY WITH WHICH IT IS USED, AND TO SWITCH FROM POLLUTING FORMS TO CLEAN ENERGY SOURCES.  REDUCING THE DEMAND FOR ENERGY  HALF THE ENERGY CURRENTLY USED IN THE UK IS WASTED, AND COULD BE SAVED BY USING IT MORE EFFICIENTLY, IN HOMES, BUSINESSES AND TRANSPORT. OUR HOMES INSULATION PROGRAMME WILL IMPROVE HOUSEHOLD ENERGY EFFICIENCY STANDARDS, HELP TO ERADICATE FUEL POVERTY AND PROVIDE SUBSTANTIAL NEW EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES. MANDATORY STANDARDS AND LABELS FOR BUILDINGS, MACHINERY, VEHICLES AND APPLIANCES, TOGETHER WITH LOWER VAT ON ENERGY CONSERVATION MATERIALS, WILL ENCOURAGE HOUSEHOLDERS AND BUSINESSES TO CUT ENERGY USE. WE WILL ENCOURAGE COMBINED HEAT AND POWER SCHEMES TO REDUCE THE ENERGY WASTED IN POWER GENERATION.  BOOSTING RENEWABLE ENERGY  WE WILL REQUIRE A MINIMUM OF 10% OF THE UK'S ENERGY TO BE GENERATED FROM UK-BASED RENEWABLE ENERGY SOURCES BY 2010, INCREASING BY 1% A YEAR THEREAFTER. AS WELL AS BENEFITING THE ENVIRONMENT, THIS WILL CREATE THOUSANDS OF NEW JOBS IN THE GREEN ENERGY SECTOR. WASTE INCINERATION WILL NO LONGER BE CLASSED AS RENEWABLE ENERGY.  PHASING OUT NUCLEAR POWER  WE WILL DECOMMISSION AND NOT REPLACE NUCLEAR POWER STATIONS AS THEY REACH THE END OF THEIR SAFE OPERATING LIVES. WE WILL MAINTAIN BNFL IN WHOLLY PUBLIC OWNERSHIP. WE WILL ESTABLISH AN INTERNATIONAL CENTRE OF EXCELLENCE AT DOUNREAY TO LEAD AND SPREAD GOOD PRACTICE ON DECOMMISSIONING.  TAXING ENERGY FAIRLY  THE CLIMATE CHANGE LEVY IS OVERCOMPLICATED AND BUREAUCRATIC. WE WILL GRADUALLY REPLACE IT WITH A CARBON TAX FALLING ON ALL ENERGY USE ACCORDING TO ITS CARBON CONTENT. WE WILL INVEST IN MORE ENERGY CONSERVATION AND EFFICIENCY GRANTS. WE WILL INTRODUCE A PROPERLY MONITORED EMISSIONS TRADING SCHEME TO ALLOW BUSINESSES TO CUT GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS IN THE MOST COST-EFFECTIVE WAY, AND ARGUE FOR AN EU-WIDE SCHEME AS SOON AS FEASIBLE.  REDUCE POLLUTION FROM CHEMICALS  WE WILL END UK PRODUCTION AND USE OF POPS (PERSISTENT BIO-ACCUMULATIVE CHEMICALS). WE WILL ALSO BAN THE USE OF THE MOST TOXIC CHEMICALS.  PRESERVE SCARCE WATER RESOURCES  WE WILL SET TOUGH REQUIREMENTS FOR WATER COMPANIES TO REDUCE LEAKS. WE WILL ENCOURAGE THE USE OF WATER METERS FOR DOMESTIC HOUSEHOLDS IN AREAS WITH SCARCE SUPPLIES, WITH EFFECTIVE MEASURES TO PROVIDE SECURITY FOR DISADVANTAGED PEOPLE.     REFORMING POLITICS  MAKING EVERY VOTE COUNT  DEMOCRACY IS THE GUARANTEE OF ALL OUR FREEDOMS, BUT THE STATE OF BRITISH DEMOCRACY STILL LEAVES MUCH TO BE DESIRED. LIBERAL DEMOCRATS WANT TO MAKE GOVERNMENT THE TRUE SERVANT OF THE PEOPLE, AND WE WILL DEVELOP A POLITICAL PROCESS IN WHICH ALL VOICES CAN BE HEARD.   LIBERAL DEMOCRATS WILL:  - REFORM THE VOTING SYSTEM FOR WESTMINSTER SO THAT EVERY VOTE COUNTS  - GIVE PARLIAMENT MORE POWER TO HOLD THE GOVERNMENT TO ACCOUNT  - DEVOLVE MORE POWER TO THE NATIONS AND REGIONS OF BRITAIN AND TO LOCAL AUTHORITIES     BRITAIN'S POLITICAL SYSTEM HAS CHANGED FOR THE BETTER SINCE 1997. WE HAVE CHAMPIONED DEVOLUTION FOR OVER A CENTURY, SO WE WELCOMED THE OPPORTUNITY TO PLAY OUR PART IN THE CREATION OF THE SCOTTISH PARLIAMENT, THE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY FOR WALES AND THE NORTHERN IRELAND ASSEMBLY. WE WELCOME TOO THE INTRODUCTION OF FAIRER VOTES FOR THESE BODIES.  BUT THE GAP BETWEEN GOVERNMENT AND THE GOVERNED IS STILL TOO GREAT. PUBLIC BODIES ARE NOT SUFFICIENTLY ACCOUNTABLE. VOTERS DO NOT HAVE A STRONG ENOUGH VOICE OR ENOUGH CHOICE. NO WONDER THAT MORE AND MORE PEOPLE FEEL ALIENATED FROM POLITICS.     VOTING  WE NEED A VOTING SYSTEM WHICH ACCURATELY REFLECTS THE WISHES OF VOTERS AND FOSTERS A MORE CONSTRUCTIVE APPROACH TO POLITICS. LIBERAL DEMOCRATS WILL:  - SECURE FAIR VOTES FOR ALL NATIONAL AND LOCAL ELECTIONS. FOR WESTMINSTER, WE SUPPORT THE SYSTEM OF AV+ AS PROPOSED BY THE JENKINS COMMISSION AS A FIRST STEP. WE WILL THEREFORE PUT THE JENKINS COMMISSION'S RECOMMENDATIONS BEFORE THE BRITISH PEOPLE IN A REFERENDUM AT THE EARLIEST POSSIBLE OPPORTUNITY. ULTIMATELY, WE WISH TO SEE THE SINGLE TRANSFERABLE VOTE (STV) USED FOR WESTMINSTER ELECTIONS. WE WILL INTRODUCE STV IMMEDIATELY FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENT AND EUROPEAN ELECTIONS.  - INTRODUCE VOTING AT SIXTEEN. WE WILL ALSO ALLOW PEOPLE TO STAND FOR ELECTED OFFICE AT THIS AGE, THE STAGE IN LIFE AT WHICH THEY ARE ABLE TO BEGIN FULL-TIME WORK AND PAY TAXES. WE WILL PROMOTE THE ACTION AND HABIT OF PARTICIPATION EARLIER IN LIFE THROUGH CITIZENSHIP EDUCATION AND SCHOOL COUNCILS.  - INTRODUCE NEW METHODS OF VOTING. WE WILL EXTEND THE RIGHT TO VOTE BY POST AND INVESTIGATE INTERNET VOTING, WHILE ENSURING THAT VOTES REMAIN SECURE. WE WILL ALSO PROMOTE PUBLIC INVOLVEMENT IN DECISION-MAKING, THROUGH CITIZENS' JURIES, CITIZENS' INITIATIVE REFERENDA AND ELECTRONIC CONSULTATION.     WESTMINSTER  THE WESTMINSTER PARLIAMENT IS NOT SUFFICIENTLY ACCOUNTABLE TO THE VOTERS, AND THE GOVERNMENT IS NOT SUFFICIENTLY ACCOUNTABLE TO PARLIAMENT. WE WILL STRENGTHEN THE HOUSE OF COMMONS AND DEMOCRATISE THE HOUSE OF LORDS. WE WILL:  - REPLACE THE HOUSE OF LORDS WITH A SMALLER DIRECTLY ELECTED SENATE WITH REPRESENTATIVES FROM THE NATIONS AND REGIONS OF THE UK. THE SENATE WILL BE GIVEN NEW POWERS TO IMPROVE LEGISLATION. WE WILL TRANSFER THE JUDICIAL FUNCTIONS CURRENTLY UNDERTAKEN BY THE HOUSE OF LORDS TO A NEW SUPREME COURT.  - STREAMLINE AND STRENGTHEN THE HOUSE OF COMMONS. WE WILL INCREASE THE POWERS OF SELECT COMMITTEES AND ALLOW MORE PRE-LEGISLATIVE SCRUTINY OF BILLS. WE WILL GIVE MPS MORE SAY OVER THE BUDGET BY ALLOWING THEM TO PROPOSE SPENDING AMENDMENTS. WE WILL INTRODUCE A NEW ANNUAL TAX BILL, SEPARATE FROM THE FINANCE BILL, TO ALLOW FOR GREATER CONSULTATION ON TAX MATTERS. A NEW PARLIAMENTARY COMMISSION WILL SUPPORT PARLIAMENT BY PROVIDING EXPERT ANALYSIS OF EXPENDITURE PROPOSALS.  - INTRODUCE MORE FAMILY FRIENDLY AND EFFICIENT WORKING PRACTICES FOR PARLIAMENT TO BRING A WIDER RANGE OF PEOPLE, PARTICULARLY WOMEN, INTO PARLIAMENT.  - CARRY OUT A SOCIAL JUSTICE AUDIT OF ALL BILLS TO ENSURE THAT GOVERNMENT LEGISLATION TACKLES INEQUALITY AS A PRIORITY.  - INTRODUCE A CIVIL SERVICE ACT TO MAINTAIN THE INDEPENDENCE OF THE CIVIL SERVICE. WE WILL ENSURE THAT GOVERNMENTS ARE NOT ABLE TO USE THE CIVIL SERVICE FOR PARTY POLITICAL PURPOSES BY SETTING CLEAR RULES ON THE USE OF PUBLIC MONEY AND GOVERNMENT FACILITIES.     IN THE LONG TERM, WE WILL:  - DEVELOP A WRITTEN CONSTITUTION FOR THE UNITED KINGDOM IN ORDER TO DEFINE AND PROTECT THE CONSTITUTIONAL FREEDOMS OUR POLICIES ARE DESIGNED TO ACHIEVE.  - SEPARATE CHURCH AND STATE. WE WILL SUPPORT THE DISESTABLISHMENT OF THE CHURCH OF ENGLAND TO END POLITICAL INTERFERENCE IN THE CHURCH. THE HEAD OF STATE WILL BE ABLE TO BE A MEMBER OF ANY FAITH OR NONE.     THE NATIONS AND REGIONS AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT  DESPITE THE PROGRESS MADE IN SCOTLAND, WALES AND NORTHERN IRELAND, THE UNITED KINGDOM IS STILL TOO CENTRALISED. WE WILL TAKE STEPS TOWARDS THE CREATION OF A FEDERAL UNITED KINGDOM WHERE SERVICES ARE DELIVERED AT THE LOWEST LEVEL POSSIBLE. THIS WILL BUILD A STRONGER DEMOCRACY WITHIN THE UK AS A WHOLE. WE WILL:  - GIVE GREATER POWERS TO THE NATIONS AND REGIONS. AS WE MOVE TO A MORE FEDERAL UNITED KINGDOM, WE WILL BUILD ON THE PRESENT DEVOLUTION SETTLEMENT AND STRENGTHEN THE POWERS OF THE SCOTTISH PARLIAMENT. WE WILL ALLOW THE WELSH ASSEMBLY THE RIGHT TO PASS PRIMARY LEGISLATION AND TO VARY TAXES. WE WILL EXTEND TAX-VARYING POWERS TO THE NORTHERN IRELAND ASSEMBLY FOR BOTH INCOME TAX AND CORPORATION TAX, SHOULD THE ASSEMBLY WISH TO HAVE THOSE POWERS.  - GIVE THE REGIONS OF ENGLAND MORE DEMOCRATIC POWER. WE WILL LEGISLATE FOR REFERENDA ON ELECTED REGIONAL ASSEMBLIES. IF LOCAL PEOPLE VOTE FOR A REGIONAL ASSEMBLY, THE ASSEMBLY WOULD TAKE ON A SET OF CORE POWERS FROM WESTMINSTER AND FROM CURRENT UNDEMOCRATIC REGIONAL QUANGOS. REGIONS WILL NORMALLY BE BASED ON EXISTING REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT AGENCY BOUNDARIES, BUT WITH SCOPE FOR SMALLER AREAS WHERE LOCAL IDENTITY, GEOGRAPHY AND PREFERENCES MAKE THAT APPROPRIATE. WE WOULD ALLOW FURTHER DEVOLUTION OF POWERS AND BOUNDARY CHANGES IN SUBSEQUENT REFERENDA.  - BUILD ON THE WORK OF THE NORTHERN IRELAND PEACE PROCESS. WE WILL DEVELOP CO-OPERATION WITHIN THE BRITISH ISLES THROUGH THE COUNCIL OF THE ISLES, AND WE WELCOME THE ESTABLISHMENT OF NORTH-SOUTH BODIES IN THE ISLAND OF IRELAND WITHIN THIS OVERALL FRAMEWORK. TO SUPPORT THE WORK OF THE COUNCIL WE WILL WORK TO ESTABLISH ITS OWN PERMANENT SECRETARIAT, BASED IN A CENTRAL LOCATION SUCH AS CARDIFF. WE WILL ALSO SEEK TO ESTABLISH MEETINGS OF A COUNCIL OF THE IRISH SEA WITHIN THIS FRAMEWORK TO PROMOTE UNDERSTANDING BETWEEN REPRESENTATIVES OF CARDIFF, DUBLIN, BELFAST, EDINBURGH, THE ISLE OF MAN AND APPROPRIATE REGIONS OF ENGLAND ON AREAS SUCH AS FISHING, TRANSPORT AND POLLUTION.  - ALLOCATE FUNDING ACCORDING TO NEED THROUGH A FINANCE COMMISSION FOR THE NATIONS AND REGIONS. ITS REVENUE DISTRIBUTION FORMULA WILL ALLOCATE FUNDS FROM CENTRAL GOVERNMENT TO THE NATIONS AND REGIONS ON THE BASIS OF NEED. TO SECURE STABILITY, THERE WILL BE NO CUTS IN CURRENT FUNDING. ANY CHANGES, WHICH WILL HAPPEN IN THE MEDIUM-TERM, WILL BE FUNDED FROM GROWTH IN THE ECONOMY. OVER TIME, WE WILL GIVE THE NATIONS AND REGIONS MORE POWER TO RAISE THEIR OWN MONEY.  - GIVE LOCAL PEOPLE MORE POWER. WE WILL REPLACE THE COUNCIL TAX WITH LOCAL INCOME TAX, SO THAT PEOPLE PAY ACCORDING TO THEIR ABILITY, AND WE WILL GIVE LOCAL AUTHORITIES MORE DISCRETION OVER THEIR SPENDING. WE WILL ENSURE THAT WHERE LOCAL GOVERNMENT ACQUIRES NEW DUTIES FROM CENTRAL GOVERNMENT, THEY HAVE THE MEANS TO FUND THEM, AND INTRODUCE A CONSTITUTIONAL POWER OF GENERAL COMPETENCE THAT WILL GIVE LOCAL GOVERNMENT WIDER SCOPE FOR ACTION. WE WILL ALSO DEFINE A MINIMUM STANDARD OF SERVICE FOR LOCAL COUNCILS ACROSS THE COUNTRY. FAIR VOTES FOR LOCAL ELECTIONS WILL PREVENT LOCAL DOMINATION BY ONE PARTY, WHICH DAMAGES LOCAL GOVERNMENT.     SETTING YOU FREE  - CUT THE SIZE AND COST OF CENTRAL GOVERNMENT. WE WILL REDUCE THE NUMBER OF MINISTERS AND (AS PART OF VOTING REFORM) CUT THE MEMBERSHIP OF BOTH THE HOUSE OF COMMONS AND THE UPPER HOUSE, WHILE NOT REDUCING THE CURRENT SIZE OF THE SCOTTISH PARLIAMENT, NATIONAL ASSEMBLY FOR WALES AND THE NORTHERN IRELAND ASSEMBLY. THIS WILL INCLUDE REPLACING SEPARATE UK MINISTERS FOR THE DEVOLVED NATIONS OF THE UK WITH ONE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE NATIONS AND REGIONS.     GREEN ACTION  STRENGTHENING NATIONAL ENVIRONMENT POLICY  STRENGTHEN GOVERNMENT ENVIRONMENT POLICY BY TRANSFERRING THE DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND INDUSTRYS WATER AND ENERGY ROLES TO THE DEPARTMENT OF THE ENVIRONMENT, TRANSPORT AND THE REGIONS, RENAMED THE DEPARTMENT OF THE ENVIRONMENT, ENERGY AND TRANSPORT. MEANWHILE, HOUSING, REGIONAL ISSUES AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT WILL MOVE FROM THE DETR TO A NEW DEPARTMENT OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT AND THE REGIONS.  IMPROVING ENVIRONMENTAL ACCOUNTABILITY  AN ENVIRONMENTAL RESPONSIBILITY ACT WILL SET OUT REPORTING REQUIREMENTS AND ENVIRONMENTAL STANDARDS FOR GOVERNMENT AND BUSINESSES, AND INTRODUCE ENVIRONMENTAL AUDITS ACROSS ALL GOVERNMENT DEPARTMENTS AND LOCAL AUTHORITIES WHERE THIS IS NOT ALREADY DONE.  CIVIL LIBERTIES  SETTING ALL PEOPLE FREE  CIVIL LIBERTIES ARE THE BASIS OF A GENUINELY FREE SOCIETY. THEY ARE ESSENTIAL TO A LIBERAL SOCIETY IN WHICH PEOPLE ARE ENABLED TO FULFIL THEIR POTENTIAL AND MAKE INFORMED CHOICES ABOUT THEIR LIVES.  LIBERAL DEMOCRATS WILL:  - PASS AN EQUALITY ACT TO OUTLAW ALL FORMS OF DISCRIMINATION  - REFORM THE ASYLUM SYSTEM SO THAT APPLICANTS ARE DEALT WITH FAIRLY AND QUICKLY  - EXTEND FREEDOM OF INFORMATION LEGISLATION TO PROVIDE GENUINELY OPEN ADMINISTRATION AT ALL LEVELS OF GOVERNMENT     CIVIL LIBERTIES ARE AT THE CORE OF OUR CRITIQUE OF THE OTHER PARTIES. ASYLUM SEEKERS, IN PARTICULAR, HAVE BEEN TREATED IN A DISGRACEFUL MANNER BY BOTH LABOUR AND THE CONSERVATIVES. THE BSE SCANDAL DEMONSTRATED THE DANGERS OF RESISTANCE TO FREEDOM OF INFORMATION LEGISLATION. LABOUR HAS MADE A START BUT HAS FALLEN SHORT OF BUILDING THE TRULY OPEN SOCIETY WE WANT TO SEE.  WE WILL ESTABLISH A STRONG FRAMEWORK OF INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS, EXTENDING THE PROTECTION ALREADY AFFORDED BY EUROPEAN LAW, SO THAT THE RIGHTS OF THE INDIVIDUAL OUTWEIGH THE INTERESTS OF THE GOVERNMENT.     DISCRIMINATION  WE WILL COMBAT DISCRIMINATION ON THE GROUNDS OF RACE AND IN ALL ITS OTHER FORMS. WE WILL:  - STRENGTHEN THE FIGHT AGAINST DISCRIMINATION WITH AN EQUALITY ACT. THIS WILL FIGHT UNFAIR DISCRIMINATION ON WHATEVER GROUNDS, INCLUDING RACE, SEX, RELIGION, SEXUAL ORIENTATION, DISABILITY, AGE OR GENDER IDENTITY. A NEW EQUALITY COMMISSION WILL BE ABLE TO INVESTIGATE POTENTIAL BREACHES OF THE ACT AND TAKE ACTION IN ITS OWN NAME. THE COMMISSION WILL ALSO HAVE RESPONSIBILITY FOR CHILDREN'S RIGHTS, THROUGH A CHILDREN'S RIGHTS COMMISSIONER. WE WILL ALSO CREATE A SEPARATE HUMAN RIGHTS COMMISSION TO SAFEGUARD HUMAN RIGHTS.  - SUPPORT RECENT EUROPEAN ANTI-DISCRIMINATION LEGISLATION. WE WILL BACK MEASURES UNDER ARTICLE 13 OF THE TREATY OF AMSTERDAM ON ANTI-DISCRIMINATION. THIS INCLUDES RACE AND EMPLOYMENT LEGISLATION AND ACTION.  - ESTABLISH A SCHEME FOR THE CIVIL REGISTRATION OF PARTNERSHIPS. THIS WILL GIVE TWO UNRELATED ADULTS WHO WISH TO REGISTER A SETTLED PERSONAL RELATIONSHIP LEGAL RIGHTS, SUCH AS NEXT-OF-KIN ARRANGEMENTS, WHICH ARE AT PRESENT ONLY AVAILABLE TO MARRIED COUPLES.     IMMIGRATION AND ASYLUM  IMMIGRANTS ARE TOO OFTEN LABELLED AS A PROBLEM FOR BRITISH SOCIETY. BRITAIN HAS BENEFITED HUGELY FROM IMMIGRATION, IN THE SAME WAY THAT MANY BRITONS WHO HAVE EMIGRATED HAVE BENEFITED FROM THEIR EXPERIENCE. THERE ARE PRACTICAL AS WELL AS HUMANITARIAN REASONS FOR TREATING IMMIGRANTS DECENTLY. THE SHORTAGE OF SKILLED WORKERS IN MANY FIELDS MEANS THEY HAVE AN IMPORTANT CONTRIBUTION TO MAKE TO BRITISH SOCIETY. WE WILL:     - PROTECT PEOPLE FLEEING FROM PERSECUTION BY DEALING WITH ASYLUM APPLICATIONS FAIRLY AND MORE QUICKLY, WHICH WILL ALSO MINIMISE ANY OPPORTUNITIES FOR ANYONE TO EXPLOIT EITHER THE SYSTEM OR ASYLUM SEEKERS. WE WILL INTRODUCE FAIR BENEFITS FOR ASYLUM SEEKERS TO REPLACE THE DEMEANING VOUCHER SYSTEM. WE WILL REVIEW THE FAILING DISPERSAL SYSTEM, END ANY UNNECESSARY RESTRICTIONS ON ASYLUM SEEKERS UNDERTAKING VOLUNTARY WORK AND REVIEW RESTRICTIONS ON PAID WORK BY ASYLUM SEEKERS IN THEIR FIRST SIX MONTHS. RECOGNISING PRESSURES ON HOST COMMUNITIES, WE WILL ENSURE THAT LOCAL SERVICES ARE ADEQUATELY COMPENSATED FOR THE COST OF SUPPORTING ASYLUM SEEKERS. WE WILL WORK WITH OTHER COUNTRIES TO ENSURE THAT RESPONSIBILITIES ARE SENSIBLY SHARED, AND TO SEEK A SYSTEM WHICH DISCOURAGES ILLEGAL TRAFFICKING IN PEOPLE.  - FREE IMMIGRATION LAWS FROM DISCRIMINATION. WE WILL ENSURE THAT IMMIGRATION POLICY IS NON-DISCRIMINATORY IN ITS APPLICATION. WE WILL REFORM CURRENT IMMIGRATION LAWS SO THAT FAMILIES ARE NOT DIVIDED. WE WILL ALSO REGULARLY REVIEW IMMIGRATION POLICY, SEPARATE FROM OUR ASYLUM OBLIGATIONS, INCLUDING AN ASSESSMENT OF SKILLS NEEDS OF THE COUNTRY IN AN INCREASINGLY GLOBAL ECONOMY.     THE RIGHT TO KNOW AND THE RIGHT TO PRIVACY  WHILE INDIVIDUALS SHOULD HAVE THE RIGHT TO KNOW AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE ABOUT DECISIONS TAKEN BY GOVERNMENT, THERE SHOULD BE LIMITS TO THE INFORMATION WHICH GOVERNMENT CAN OBTAIN ABOUT INDIVIDUALS. WE WILL:  - STRENGTHEN FREEDOM OF INFORMATION LEGISLATION. THIS WILL BREAK OPEN THE EXCESSIVE SECRECY OF GOVERNMENT AND DEVELOP OPEN AND ACCOUNTABLE ADMINISTRATION. IN PARTICULAR, IT WILL INCREASE ACCESS TO FACTS AND FIGURES UNDERLYING GOVERNMENT POLICY DECISIONS AND REDUCE MINISTERS POWERS TO BLOCK THE RELEASE OF INFORMATION.  - PROTECT PRIVACY. PRIVACY IS PROTECTED BY THE EUROPEAN CONVENTION ON HUMAN RIGHTS WHICH IS NOW INCORPORATED INTO UK LAW. WE ARE OPPOSED TO FURTHER PRIVACY LAWS WHICH COULD THREATEN FREE SPEECH, EXCEPT FOR A CIVIL OFFENCE OF PHYSICAL INTRUSION TO PREVENT HARASSMENT OF INDIVIDUALS BY THE MEDIA. WE WILL NOT INTRODUCE COMPULSORY NATIONAL IDENTITY CARDS.  - BRING THE SECURITY SERVICES UNDER PARLIAMENTARY CONTROL. AT THE MOMENT, THE SECURITY SERVICES ARE OVERSEEN BY A COMMITTEE REPORTING TO THE PRIME MINISTER. WE WILL MAKE THEM ACCOUNTABLE TO A PARLIAMENTARY SELECT COMMITTEE.  SETTING YOU FREE  - IMPROVE SAFEGUARDS AGAINST THE MISUSE OF SURVEILLANCE AND INTERCEPTION POWERS BY LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES INCLUDING INTERCEPTION AND TRACKING OF ELECTRONIC COMMUNICATIONS. WE WILL REPLACE THE SYSTEM OF WARRANTS APPROVED BY MINISTERS WITH A SYSTEM OF APPROVAL BY JUDGES TO REMOVE ANY CONFLICTS OF INTEREST AND TO INCREASE ACCOUNTABILITY. WE BELIEVE THAT THERE SHOULD BE A PRESUMPTION IN FAVOUR OF AN INDIVIDUAL'S FREEDOM FROM INTRUSION INTO THEIR PRIVATE LIFE AND THAT IT SHOULD BE UP TO THE GOVERNMENT TO PROVE THE NEED FOR IT. WE WOULD ENSURE ADEQUATE SAFEGUARDS AGAINST UNNECESSARY MONITORING AND ACCESS TO PRIVATE ELECTRONIC COMMUNICATIONS AND REVIEW THE IMPACT ON THE ELECTRONIC COMMERCE INDUSTRY OF LABOURS REGULATION OF INVESTIGATORY POWERS ACT.  - REPEAL SECTION 28 OF THE 1988 LOCAL GOVERNMENT ACT. THIS GIVES LEGAL SANCTION TO DISCRIMINATION, PREVENTING SCHOOLS TAKING EFFECTIVE MEASURES AGAINST BULLYING AND HAMPERING RESPONSIBLE SEX EDUCATION.     GREEN ACTION  IMPROVING ENVIRONMENTAL KNOWLEDGE  A RIGHT TO ENVIRONMENTAL INFORMATION, AS PART OF FREEDOM OF INFORMATION LEGISLATION, WILL COVER ISSUES SUCH AS LOCAL AIR QUALITY, EMISSIONS FROM LOCAL FACTORIES, AND THE POTENTIAL ENVIRONMENTAL RISKS FROM GENETICALLY MODIFIED ORGANISMS (GMOS). WE WILL ALSO INTRODUCE A DUTY TO ELECTRONIC PUBLICATION OF ENVIRONMENTAL INFORMATION.  PROTECTING PROTEST  WE WILL PROTECT THE RIGHT TO LEGAL AND PEACEFUL PROTEST ON ALL ISSUES, INCLUDING ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS.  PROTECTING ANIMALS  ALTHOUGH WE SUPPORT FIRM ACTION AGAINST VIOLENT PROTESTS BY ANIMAL RIGHTS ACTIVISTS, WE ARE COMMITTED TO STRENGTHENING ANIMAL WELFARE. WE WILL ESTABLISH AN ANIMAL PROTECTION COMMISSION TO STRENGTHEN ANIMAL WELFARE PROTECTION. WE WILL EXTEND THE SIZE AND POWERS OF THE HOME OFFICE INSPECTORATE AND ENCOURAGE MORE UNANNOUNCED INSPECTIONS. WE WILL END THE USE OF ANIMALS IN THE DEVELOPMENT AND TESTING OF WEAPONS AND HOUSEHOLD GOODS, AND END UNNECESSARY REPETITIVE TESTS. WE WILL FUND RESEARCH INTO ALTERNATIVES TO ANIMAL TESTING. WE BELIEVE THAT FARM ANIMALS SHOULD BE ENTITLED TO HIGH WELFARE STANDARDS. WE WILL PROVIDE MORE CUSTOMS OFFICERS WITH CONVENTION ON INTERNATIONAL TRADE IN ENDANGERED SPECIES TRAINING SO THAT THE LAW CAN BE ENFORCED MORE EFFECTIVELY. WE BELIEVE THAT THE ISSUE OF HUNTING WITH HOUNDS SHOULD BE SETTLED BY MPS ON A FREE VOTE.     RURAL, URBAN AND SUBURBAN LIFE  ACTION FOR YOUR LOCAL COMMUNITY  OUTSIDE THEIR FAMILY, MOST PEOPLE'S IMMEDIATE CONCERNS INVOLVE THE LOCAL COMMUNITY WHERE THEY LIVE, WORK, SHOP AND SPEND THEIR LEISURE TIME. WE WISH TO BUILD SUSTAINABLE COMMUNITIES WHICH PROVIDE FOR THE NEEDS OF THEIR CITIZENS, ENHANCE THEIR LIVES, AND PRESERVE THE ENVIRONMENT.     LIBERAL DEMOCRATS WILL:  - BOOST LOCAL ECONOMIES BY PROTECTING LOCAL SERVICES AND PROMOTING LOCAL INNOVATION  - SUPPORT RURAL EMPLOYERS, FARMING AND FISHING  - REVIVE DEPRESSED AREAS BY INTRODUCING A ONE-STOP REGENERATION GRANT SYSTEM TO DISTRIBUTE FUNDS MORE EFFECTIVELY  - CREATE INCENTIVES FOR DEVELOPERS TO BUILD ON BROWNFIELD RATHER THAN GREENFIELD SITES     MARGARET THATCHER NOTORIOUSLY REMARKED ""THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS SOCIETY"". IT WAS AN ATTITUDE WHICH WEAKENED COMMUNITIES ALL OVER BRITAIN DURING THE CONSERVATIVE YEARS. NOW, IN MANY COMMUNITIES IN BRITAIN, THERE IS GROWING DISSATISFACTION WITH LABOUR TOO. IN RURAL AREAS, PEOPLE FEEL THAT THE LABOUR PARTY DOES NOT UNDERSTAND THEIR NEEDS. IN MUCH OF URBAN BRITAIN, ARROGANT AND COMPLACENT LABOUR COUNCILS ARE OUT OF TOUCH WITH LOCAL PEOPLE.  OUR OPPONENTS WANT TO CONTROL FROM THE CENTRE. WE WILL ALLOW COMMUNITIES TO MAKE DECISIONS FOR THEMSELVES, WHILE PROVIDING HIGH-QUALITY SERVICES AND PROTECTING THE ENVIRONMENT.     BUILDING STRONG LOCAL COMMUNITIES  THE STRONGEST LOCAL COMMUNITIES ARE BUILT ON THE ACTIONS OF INDIVIDUALS WITHIN THEM. GOVERNMENT SHOULD NOT INTERFERE AND HAMPER THEIR EFFORTS. IT CAN NONETHELESS PLAY A ROLE IN STIMULATING AND SUPPORTING COMMUNITIES. WE WILL:  - REGENERATE DEPRIVED COMMUNITIES WHEREVER THEY ARE THROUGH A ONE-STOP REGENERATION GRANT SYSTEMS. THIS WOULD STREAMLINE EXISTING REGENERATION MEASURES, INCLUDING REGIONAL SELECTIVE ASSISTANCE, ENGLISH PARTNERSHIPS AND THE NEW DEAL FOR COMMUNITIES. THE NEW SINGLE SCHEME WILL HELP MATCH-FUNDING APPLICATIONS AND SIMPLIFY THE APPLICATION AND APPEAL PROCESS. WE WILL ENSURE THAT ALL REGENERATION SCHEMES ARE TRULY IN LINE WITH THE ASPIRATIONS OF THE COMMUNITIES THEY ARE DESIGNED TO HELP BY STRENGTHENING LOCAL DEMOCRATIC INPUT INTO DECISION-MAKING.  - BOOST RURAL LOCAL SERVICES BY DIRECTING MORE MONEY TO PROVIDE HIGH-QUALITY SERVICES, SUCH AS SCHOOLS AND POST OFFICES, TO THE RURAL POPULATION. WE WILL DO THIS BY REFORMING FUNDING FORMULAE TO ENSURE THAT RESOURCES ARE ALLOCATED FAIRLY THROUGHOUT THE UK, AND BY GIVING LOCAL AUTHORITIES GREATER FINANCIAL FREEDOMS. WE WILL TACKLE RURAL SOCIAL EXCLUSION BY PROVIDING EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES IN NEW INDUSTRIES AND IN FARMING FOR THE YOUNG.  - HELP EVERYONE FEEL SAFE IN THEIR HOMES. PEOPLE LIVING IN INNER CITY HOUSING BLOCKS ACROSS THE COUNTRY SUFFER UNACCEPTABLE LEVELS OF CRIME ON THEIR OWN DOORSTEPS BECAUSE THERE IS NO SECURE FRONT DOOR ON THE BUILDING IN WHICH THEY LIVE. WE WILL GIVE A HIGH PRIORITY TO TACKLING THE SECURITY OF THESE BUILDINGS THROUGH OUR ""SAFE FRONT DOORS FOR ALL"" INITIATIVE, ORGANISED AS PART OF OUR WIDER CRIME PREVENTION PROGRAMME.     SUPPORTING FARMING AND FISHERIES  MANY COMMUNITIES ARE HIGHLY DEPENDENT ON A SINGLE LOCAL INDUSTRY. IN MANY AREAS, THIS MEANS FISHING OR AGRICULTURE. GOVERNMENT COULD BE DOING MUCH MORE TO SUPPORT BOTH. WE HAVE ALREADY PUBLISHED AN EMERGENCY PROGRAMME TO HELP FARMERS AND BUSINESSES WHO HAVE SUFFERED DURING THE FOOT AND MOUTH CRISIS. ON OTHER ISSUES WE WILL:  - REFORM THE COMMON AGRICULTURAL POLICY. REFORM IS LONG OVERDUE. WE WILL PROMOTE THE SUSTAINABILITY OF AGRICULTURE AND REDIRECT SUPPORT SO THAT SMALL AND FAMILY FARMS ARE MORE EFFECTIVELY SUPPORTED. WE WILL SEEK TO REFOCUS PAYMENTS ON ACHIEVING PUBLIC ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIAL GOALS RATHER THAN ENCOURAGING UNNECESSARY PRODUCTION WHILE MAINTAINING THE CURRENT OVERALL LEVEL OF SUPPORT FOR FARMERS AND RURAL AREAS. WE WILL WORK WITHIN EUROPE TO LIMIT BUREAUCRACY BY ADMINISTERING CAP PAYMENTS THROUGH A SINGLE COUNTRYSIDE MANAGEMENT CONTRACT WHICH WOULD INCLUDE STEWARDSHIP AND AGRI-ENVIRONMENT SCHEMES AS WELL AS SUPPORT FOR DIVERSIFICATION, ORGANIC FARMING AND FARMERS CO-OPERATIVES.  - PROTECT TENANT FARMERS BY FUNDING A TARGETED EARLY RETIREMENT AND NEW ENTRANT SCHEME AND BY REASSESSING DIVERSIFICATION SCHEMES TO ALLOW TENANTS MORE SCOPE TO DIVERSIFY.  - ENCOURAGE ORGANIC FARMING BY BETTER SUPPORT FOR TRANSITION FROM CURRENT METHODS OF FARMING.  - REFORM THE PRESENT COMMON FISHERIES POLICY. THE MAIN OBJECTIVE OF FISHERIES POLICY MUST BE TO INTEGRATE THE LONG-TERM CONSERVATION OF THE MARINE ENVIRONMENT WITH THE SOCIO-ECONOMIC INTERESTS OF LOCAL COMMUNITIES. WE WANT TO ESTABLISH REGIONAL MANAGEMENT COMMITTEES THROUGH WHICH FISHERMEN WOULD WORK WITH SCIENTISTS AND GOVERNMENT TO AGREE SUSTAINABLE AND FAIRLY ENFORCED ZONAL MANAGEMENT FOR THEIR LOCAL FISHERIES. WE WILL MAKE THE CASE FOR ESTABLISHING THE 6-12 MILE FISHING LIMIT AS A PERMANENT FEATURE OF POLICY, AND WORK WITH OTHER FISHING NATIONS TO AGREE TO EXTEND THE NATIONAL PROTECTION ZONES OUT TO 24 MILES. WE WILL STRENGTHEN AND UPDATE THE REGULATORY FRAMEWORK FOR SEAS FISHERIES COMMITTEES AND TAKE LOW IMPACT FISHING METHODS OUT OF THE QUOTA SYSTEM ALTOGETHER.  - ABOLISH THE MINISTRY OF AGRICULTURE, FISHERIES AND FOOD WITH ITS NUMEROUS CONFLICTS OF INTEREST WHICH HAVE PREVENTED IT FROM EFFECTIVELY ADDRESSING ISSUES SUCH AS BSE, GM CROPS, AND FOOT AND MOUTH.  INSTEAD, WE WILL CREATE A MINISTRY FOR RURAL AFFAIRS TO PROMOTE THE INTERESTS OF THE COUNTRYSIDE AS A WHOLE.  AN AGRICULTURAL OMBUDSMAN WILL PROTECT FARMING, AND FOOD SAFETY ISSUES WILL BE THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND THE FOOD STANDARDS AGENCY.        SUPPORTING LOCAL ECONOMIES  LOCAL ECONOMIES OPERATE MOST EFFECTIVELY WHEN THERE IS LOCAL INNOVATION AND MONEY CIRCULATES LOCALLY IN A DIVERSE RANGE OF SMALL BUSINESSES PROVIDING FOR LOCAL NEEDS. STRONG VOLUNTARY AND NON-GOVERNMENTAL BODIES ALSO ENRICH AND STRENGTHEN THESE COMMUNITIES. WE WILL:  - SUPPORT LOCAL MARKETS INCLUDING FARMERS MARKETS BY PROVIDING FUNDS FROM SINGLE REGENERATION GRANTS TO REGENERATE LOCAL SHOPPING AREAS, PRESERVING A DIVERSE RANGE OF RETAIL OUTLETS AND ENCOURAGING FLEXIBILITY IN PLANNING REGULATIONS FOR SMALLER OUTLETS.  - TACKLE FINANCIAL EXCLUSION BY PROMOTING COMMUNITY BANKING, LOCAL EXCHANGE AND TRADING SCHEMES (LETS), AND CREDIT UNIONS. WE WILL ALSO SUPPORT INITIATIVES SUCH AS THE COMMUNITY LOAN FUND IN WALES.  - ENCOURAGE VOLUNTEERING BY SETTING UP A NETWORK OF MUTUAL VOLUNTEERING EXCHANGES OR TIME BANKS THROUGH WHICH PEOPLE COULD EXCHANGE TIME SPENT VOLUNTEERING, REGISTERED THROUGH THE LOCAL TIME BANK, WITH HELP FOR THEMSELVES OR DISCOUNTS ON PUBLIC TRANSPORT AND SPORTS FACILITIES.  - PROTECT VILLAGE PUBS AND LOCAL BREWERIES BY EXTENDING THE 50% MANDATORY RATE RELIEF CURRENTLY ENJOYED BY SOME VILLAGE SHOPS AND POST OFFICES TO SOLE VILLAGE PUBS AND ENCOURAGE WIDER USE OF LOCAL AUTHORITY POWERS TO GRANT ADDITIONAL DISCRETIONARY RELIEF FOR SERVICES AND BUSINESSES.  - PROMOTE TOURISM. WE WILL BRING TOGETHER THE MARKETING AND INFRASTRUCTURE WORK OF GOVERNMENT, LOCAL COUNCILS AND TOURIST BOARDS. WE WILL ENSURE THAT LOCAL COMMUNITIES ARE INVOLVED IN THE PLANNING OF TOURISM FROM THE EARLIEST STAGES.     A DECENT LIVING ENVIRONMENT  THE QUALITY OF LIFE FOR ALL PEOPLE DEPENDS VERY MUCH ON THEIR SURROUNDINGS  THE QUALITY AND COST OF THEIR HOUSING, THE FABRIC OF NEARBY BUILDINGS, AND THEIR NATURAL SURROUNDINGS. TO PROMOTE A CLEAN AND HEALTHY LIVING ENVIRONMENT WE WILL:  - PROMOTE DECENT AND MORE AFFORDABLE HOUSING. WE WILL OPEN UP CONVEYANCING TO GREATER COMPETITION, TAKE ACTION TO TACKLE GAZUMPING, STRENGTHEN LEASEHOLDERS LEGAL RIGHTS, INVOLVE TENANTS IN THE MANAGEMENT OF HOUSING ESTATES, AND PROTECT TENANTS AGAINST MISUSE OF RENT DEPOSITS. WE WILL ALLOW LOCAL AUTHORITIES TO SPECIFY THE PERCENTAGE OF SOCIAL HOUSING FOR ALL NEW DEVELOPMENTS. WE WILL AIM TO PROVIDE LIFETIME HOMES AND MAKE SURE THAT BUILDING REGULATIONS PROVIDE FOR FLEXIBILITY TO UNDERTAKE LOW-COST CONVERSION FOR WHEELCHAIR ACCESS, FITTINGS, SHOWERS AND STAIR LIFTS. WE WILL GIVE LOCAL COUNCILS THE POWER TO END THE 50% REBATE ON COUNCIL TAX FOR SECOND HOMES.  - COMBAT HOMELESSNESS BY GIVING LOCAL AUTHORITIES GREATER FREEDOM TO INVEST IN HOUSING, AND BY MAKING HEALTH AUTHORITIES RESPONSIBLE FOR ENSURING THAT PATIENTS DISCHARGED INTO THE COMMUNITY HAVE SOMEWHERE TO LIVE. WE WILL INCREASE THE AVAILABILITY OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING BY TAKING ACTION TO REQUIRE PUBLIC AND PRIVATE LANDLORDS TO BRING EMPTY HOMES BACK INTO USE. WE WILL MAKE RENOVATION A MORE AFFORDABLE OPTION BY EQUALISING VAT AT A LOWER LEVEL TO BE CHARGED EQUALLY ON NEW BUILD AND REFURBISHMENT COSTS.  - PROTECT GREENFIELD SITES AND ENCOURAGE URBAN REGENERATION THROUGH PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN LOCAL AUTHORITIES AND PRIVATE ENTERPRISE, AND OUR REFORM OF THE VAT SYSTEM. IN ADDITION TO AN IMMEDIATE CUT IN BUSINESS RATES THROUGH A BUSINESS RATE ALLOWANCE, WE WILL ALSO ALLOW LOCAL COUNCILS TO REPLACE THE UNIFORM BUSINESS RATE WITH A SYSTEM BASED ON THE VALUE OF EACH SITE (SITE VALUE RATING). THIS WOULD ENCOURAGE RATHER THAN PENALISE THOSE WHO DEVELOP INNER-CITY SITES. WE WILL ALSO CLEAN UP BROWNFIELD AND DAMAGED WILDLIFE SITES USING REVENUE FROM A GREENFIELD DEVELOPMENT LEVY SET BY LOCAL AUTHORITIES.  - REQUIRE MOBILE PHONE COMPANIES TO OBTAIN LOCAL PLANNING PERMISSION FOR ALL NEW MOBILE PHONE MAST INSTALLATIONS.  - ESTABLISH EFFECTIVE MEASUREMENT OF LIVING COSTS THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY. WE WANT TO ENSURE THAT PUBLIC SERVICE WORKERS LIKE TEACHERS AND NURSES ARE PROPERLY SUPPORTED WHEN THEY LIVE IN EXPENSIVE AREAS. WE WILL THEREFORE COLLECT DATA ON PRICE VARIATIONS BETWEEN REGIONS SO THAT MEASURES CAN BE EFFECTIVELY TARGETED.     SETTING YOU FREE  - LESSEN CENTRAL CONTROLS ON FISHING BY REFORMING THE COMMON FISHERIES POLICY TO PROMOTE LOCAL MANAGEMENT OF FISHERIES.  - REDUCE RED TAPE FOR FARMERS THROUGH SINGLE COUNTRYSIDE MANAGEMENT CONTRACTS TO MANAGE FARM PAYMENTS, AND AN AGRICULTURAL OMBUDSMAN TO TACKLE MALADMINISTRATION.  - PUT LOCAL PRIORITIES FIRST IN PLANNING REGENERATION SCHEMES SO THAT COMMUNITIES DEVELOP ACCORDING TO THE ASPIRATIONS OF THOSE THAT LIVE THERE.     GREEN ACTION  GUARD AGAINST POSSIBLE DANGERS OF GM CROPS  WE WILL SEEK TO INTRODUCE A MORATORIUM AT AN EU LEVEL, ON COMMERCIAL GROWING OF GENETICALLY MODIFIED CROPS UNTIL 2004, TO ALLOW RESEARCH INTO THEIR SAFETY AND ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT TO BE COMPLETED.  PROTECT OUR SEAS  WE WILL DEVELOP A NATIONAL OCEANS AND COASTS POLICY IN CONSULTATION WITH SCIENTISTS AND THE FISHING INDUSTRY TO PROVIDE SUSTAINABLE LIVELIHOODS AND PROSPERITY FOR COASTAL COMMUNITIES, IMPROVED HEALTH OF THE SEAS FOR WILDLIFE AND A SAFER ENVIRONMENT FOR MARINE ACTIVITIES. THIS WILL INCLUDE A NETWORK OF MARINE PROTECTED AREAS COVERING 10 PER CENT OF OUR SEAS AND PILOTING FISHING-FREE ZONES TO HELP THE RECOVERY OF FISH STOCKS. WE WILL UNDERPIN THIS BY INTRODUCING CONSOLIDATED MARINE LEGISLATION IN COLLABORATION WITH THE DEVOLVED INSTITUTIONS OF THE UK. WE WILL ALSO IMPLEMENT POLLUTION REDUCTION AND PREVENTION PROGRAMMES TO MEET TARGETS UNDER THE OSPAR CONVENTION BY 2020.  BOOST CONSERVATION SCHEMES  WE WILL PROTECT THE ENVIRONMENT AND CREATE GREEN JOBS IN URBAN, RURAL AND MARINE HABITATS, FOR EXAMPLE, THROUGH MORE ORGANIC FARMING, INCREASING GREEN SPACES IN URBAN AREAS, AND WOODLAND MANAGEMENT. SUCH SCHEMES WILL FORM PART OF OUR WILDLIFE GUARANTEE TO PROTECT ENDANGERED SPECIES. WE WILL ALSO AIM TO PRESERVE AND INCREASE THE AREA OF GREENFIELD SITES IN THE UK.  REFORM PLANNING  WE WILL ENSURE THAT LOCAL AUTHORITY STRUCTURE PLANS INCORPORATE TARGETS FOR CO~2~ EMISSION REDUCTIONS TO ENCOURAGE THE DEVELOPMENT OF RENEWABLE ENERGY FACILITIES AND ACCOUNT FOR THE CLIMATE CHANGE CONSEQUENCES OF THEIR POLICIES, INCLUDING TRANSPORT.  PROTECT GREEN SPACES  WE WILL CREATE A NEW DESIGNATION OF PROTECTED SITE, WITH EQUIVALENT PROTECTION TO SITES OF SPECIFIC SCIENTIFIC INTEREST, FOR GREEN AREAS OF PARTICULAR IMPORTANCE OR VALUE TO THE COMMUNITY. WE WILL MANAGE SSSIS TO ENHANCE THEIR ENVIRONMENTAL VALUE AND IMPOSE A BINDING DUTY OF CARE ON OWNERS AND TENANTS TO AVOID FURTHER SIGNIFICANT DAMAGE OR FRAGMENTATION.  REDUCING WASTE AND PROMOTING RECYCLING  OUR NATIONAL RECYCLING PROGRAMME WILL PROVIDE A DOORSTEP RECYCLING COLLECTION FOR EVERY HOUSEHOLD BY THE END OF THE NEXT PARLIAMENT. WE WILL SEEK TO RECYCLE 60% OF HOUSEHOLD WASTE WITHIN 10 YEARS. WE WILL ALSO GRADUALLY INCREASE THE LANDFILL TAX TO ENCOURAGE ALTERNATIVE METHODS OF DISPOSAL, BACKED UP BY AN EVENTUAL BAN ON ALL BUT CERTAIN TYPES OF WASTE. WE WILL NOT BUILD INCINERATORS UNLESS RESULTS OF RESEARCH ON THEIR IMPACT SHOW THAT THEY ARE SAFE AND THE BEST ENVIRONMENTAL OPTION.  FLOODS AND FLOODING  WE WILL IMMEDIATELY SET UP A NATIONAL TASK FORCE TO REVIEW ARRANGEMENTS FOR FLOOD DEFENCE MANAGEMENT AND RESPONSE. WE WILL ALSO USE PLANNING MEASURES TO REDUCE FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS TAKING PLACE ON FLOODPLAINS AND IMPROVE STANDARDS OF DRAINAGE FROM BOTH URBAN AND RURAL (PARTICULARLY AGRICULTURAL) LAND USE. IN THE LONG TERM, FLOODING WILL CONTINUE TO BECOME MORE SEVERE UNLESS CLIMATE CHANGE IS TACKLED EFFECTIVELY  WHICH OUR ENERGY AND TRANSPORT POLICIES ARE DESIGNED TO DO.     BRITAIN'S ROLE IN THE EUROPEAN UNION  YOUR SAY IN EUROPE  THE EUROPEAN UNION HAS A FUNDAMENTAL ROLE IN GUARANTEEING PEACE AND FREEDOM IN EUROPE. BY PROMOTING ENTERPRISE, PROTECTING THE ENVIRONMENT AND FIGHTING DISCRIMINATION, THE EU BRINGS ENORMOUS BENEFITS TO BRITAIN. YET NEITHER CONSERVATIVE NOR LABOUR GOVERNMENTS HAVE MADE THE MOST OF BRITAINS POTENTIAL AS A CORE MEMBER OF THE EU.  OUR PRIORITIES IN EUROPE ARE:  - ENLARGEMENT OF THE EU TO INCLUDE THE EMERGING DEMOCRACIES OF CENTRAL AND EASTERN EUROPE  - REFORM OF THE EU'S INSTITUTIONS TO MAKE THEM MORE OPEN, DEMOCRATIC AND EFFECTIVE  - REACHING AGREEMENT ON A CONSTITUTIONAL SETTLEMENT FOR EUROPE TO DEFINE AND LIMIT THE POWERS OF THE EU  - CO-OPERATION WITH OUR EUROPEAN LIBERAL DEMOCRAT PARTNERS TO ACHIEVE OUR AIMS IN THESE AREAS  LIBERAL DEMOCRATS ARE FIRM SUPPORTERS OF THE EUROPEAN UNION, BUT AS CRITICAL MEMBERS OF THE EUROPEAN FAMILY, WE ARE ALSO FIRM ON ITS FAILINGS. WE BELIEVE THAT THE EU OFFERS THE BEST MEANS OF PROMOTING BRITAINS INTERESTS IN EUROPE AND IN THE WIDER WORLD. NATIONS ACTING TOGETHER CAN ACHIEVE MORE.  THE EU MUST HAVE THE RESOURCES AND POWERS TO ACT IN AREAS WHERE PROBLEMS CANNOT BE SOLVED AT A NATIONAL LEVEL. BUT IT SHOULD STAY CLEAR WHEN EUROPEAN ACTION IS NOT NECESSARY.  EUROPE NEEDS A NEW AGENDA FOR REFORM. LIBERAL DEMOCRATS ARE DETERMINED THAT BRITAIN SHOULD LEAD THIS REFORM. WE WANT A EUROPE WHERE THE INTERESTS OF PEOPLE, NOT BUREAUCRATS, COME FIRST; A EUROPE THAT SEEKS TO EMPOWER PEOPLE, NOT IMPOSE UPON THEM; AND WHERE EUROPEAN INSTITUTIONS CONCENTRATE ON WHAT THEY DO BEST. WE WILL WORK TO:  - ESTABLISH A CONSTITUTION FOR THE EUROPEAN UNION TO DEFINE AND LIMIT THE POWERS OF THE EU ENSURING THAT DECISIONS ARE MADE AT THE MOST APPROPRIATE LEVEL. IT WOULD SET OUT THE ROLES, RESPONSIBILITIES AND POWERS OF EU INSTITUTIONS IN RELATION TO MEMBER STATES. IT WOULD PROVIDE A STABLE AND LEGITIMATE FRAMEWORK TO REINFORCE DEMOCRACY AND RESTORE PUBLIC CONFIDENCE IN THE EU. THE CHARTER OF FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS SHOULD BE AT THE HEART OF A CONSTITUTION FOR EUROPE.  - FOCUS THE SCOPE OF EUROPEAN UNION ACTION. WE NEED TO IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF EU GOVERNANCE. THE EU SHOULD FOCUS ITS POLICY-MAKING ONLY ON THOSE AREAS FOR WHICH EU-WIDE ACTION IS INDISPENSABLE. THIS MEANS ENSURING THAT THE PRINCIPLE OF SUBSIDIARITY IS FULLY RESPECTED. A STANDING SCRUTINY COMMITTEE IN THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT SHOULD BE ESTABLISHED TO ENSURE THAT EU PROPOSALS MEET THE CRITERIA OF SUBSIDIARITY AND PROPORTIONALITY.  - MAKE THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION MORE DEMOCRATICALLY ACCOUNTABLE. THE COMMISSION PRESIDENTS STATE OF THE UNION SPEECH SHOULD BE ACCOMPANIED BY A DETAILED LIST OF PROPOSALS, INDIVIDUALLY JUSTIFIED AND EXPLAINED. EACH NEW EU LEGISLATIVE PROPOSAL SHOULD INCLUDE A JUSTIFICATION OF WHY EU ACTION IS NECESSARY. THE WORK PROGRAMME SHOULD BE PUT TO A SUBSTANTIVE VOTE BY THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT IN PLENARY SESSION. THE COMMITTEES OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT SHOULD BE ABLE TO CROSS-EXAMINE INDIVIDUAL COMMISSIONERS ON THE PROPOSALS UNDER THEIR RESPONSIBILITY. THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT SHOULD HAVE THE POWER TO VET AND VETO THE APPOINTMENT OF EACH AND EVERY COMMISSIONER AND, IF NECESSARY, SACK INDIVIDUAL COMMISSIONERS.  - MAKE SURE THAT EUROPEAN UNION BODIES ARE MORE OPEN. ALL EU INSTITUTIONS SHOULD CONFORM TO THE PRINCIPLES OF FREEDOM OF INFORMATION. THE COUNCIL OF MINISTERS SHOULD MEET IN PUBLIC WHENEVER IT DISCUSSES LEGISLATION AND PUBLISH A RECORD OF ITS PROCEEDINGS. THE POLITICAL LEADER OF THE COUNTRY HOLDING THE PRESIDENCY OF THE EUROPEAN COUNCIL SHOULD BE OBLIGED TO APPEAR BEFORE THE PLENARY SESSION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT BOTH BEFORE AND AFTER ALL MEETINGS OF THE EUROPEAN COUNCIL.  - MAINTAIN THE VETO IN AREAS OF VITAL INTEREST TO THE UK. WE FAVOUR THE APPLICATION OF MAJORITY VOTING IN THE COUNCIL WHERE NECESSARY TO ENSURE THAT THE EU FUNCTIONS EFFECTIVELY. BUT WE WILL MAINTAIN A VETO ON THE CONSTITUTION, DEFENCE, OWN RESOURCES, BUDGETARY AND TAX MATTERS AND REGULATIONS ON PAY AND SOCIAL SECURITY.  - IMPROVE WESTMINSTERS SCRUTINY OF EUROPEAN LEGISLATION AND OF THE ACTIVITIES OF UK MINISTERS ATTENDING THE COUNCIL OF MINISTERS. THERE SHOULD BE NO SUBSTANTIAL INITIATIVES FOR EUROPEAN LEGISLATION IN THE COUNCIL OF MINISTERS WHICH HAVE NOT BEEN SCRUTINISED BY THE UK PARLIAMENT. MINISTERS, INCLUDING THE PRIME MINISTER, SHOULD GIVE EVIDENCE BEFORE A EUROPEAN UNION AFFAIRS COMMITTEE IN WESTMINSTER PRIOR TO EUROPEAN COUNCIL MEETINGS AND ANY SIGNIFICANT MEETING OF MINISTERS.  - INCREASE THE TRANSPARENCY OF THE EUROPEAN CENTRAL BANK. THE BOARD OF THE BANK SHOULD PUBLISH ITS MINUTES AND VOTES, FOLLOWING THE PRACTICE OF THE BANK OF ENGLAND'S MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE.  - SUPPORT A EUROPEAN COMMON FOREIGN AND SECURITY POLICY THAT INCLUDES A SIGNIFICANT DEFENCE CAPABILITY CONSISTENT WITH OUR MEMBERSHIP OF NATO AND OTHER INTERNATIONAL INSTITUTIONS.  - HOLD MEETINGS OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT ONLY IN BRUSSELS TO END THE WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY INCURRED BY HOLDING MEETINGS IN STRASBOURG.  - PUSH FOR EARLY ENLARGEMENT OF THE EU. THE NATIONS OF CENTRAL AND EASTERN EUROPE HAVE NOW BEEN WAITING OVER TEN YEARS FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO BENEFIT FROM EU MEMBERSHIP. WE WILL SEEK TO ENSURE THAT THERE IS NO FURTHER SLIPPAGE IN ACCESSION SCHEDULES DEPENDENT UPON MEETING THE COPENHAGEN CRITERIA SUCH AS GUARANTEEING DEMOCRACY, THE RULE OF LAW AND HUMAN RIGHTS.     SETTING YOU FREE  - REMOVE UNNECESSARY REGULATIONS AND REDUCE ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS. WE SUPPORT MOVES TO STREAMLINE THE ROLE OF THE EU COMMISSION AND TO STRENGTHEN MEASURES AGAINST FRAUD. WE WILL PUSH FOR OBLIGATORY REGULATORY IMPACT ASSESSMENTS ON ALL NEW EU PROPOSALS WITH A DIRECT BEARING ON BUSINESSES. WE WILL ALSO STOP THE PRACTICE OF 'GOLDPLATING' EU REGULATIONS, WHEREBY THE UK GOVERNMENT UNNECESSARILY ADDS REQUIREMENTS TO MINIMUM EU STANDARDS.  GREEN ACTION  PUTTING THE ENVIRONMENT AT THE HEART OF EUROPE  ALL EU POLICIES SHOULD BE ANALYSED FOR THEIR LIKELY ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT, WITH RESULTS REPORTED TO THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT. THIS IS PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT FOR EU OVERSEAS AID, WHERE WE WILL SUPPORT THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A SPECIALISED EUROPEAN AID AGENCY. ALL MEMBER STATES MUST COMPLY FULLY WITH EU ENVIRONMENTAL STANDARDS, AND THE EUROPEAN COURT OF JUSTICE SHOULD APPLY HIGHER FINES TO THOSE FAILING TO COMPLY. WE WILL SUPPORT THE INITIATIVE STARTED AT THE CARDIFF SUMMIT TO INTEGRATE ENVIRONMENTAL OBJECTIVES INTO ALL EU ACTIVITIES  PARTICULARLY IN THE AREA OF TRADE POLICY, WHERE THE COMMISSION HAS SOLE COMPETENCE TO NEGOTIATE ON THE EUS BEHALF.     STRENGTHENING EUROPES VOICE ON THE GLOBAL ENVIRONMENT  WE WILL ARGUE FOR THE EU TO PLAY A GREATER ROLE IN RAISING ENVIRONMENTAL STANDARDS WORLD-WIDE, THROUGH PROVIDING SUPPORT FOR THE UN ENVIRONMENT PROGRAMME AND FOR THE ENFORCEMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL CONVENTIONS, SUCH AS THOSE PROTECTING ENDANGERED SPECIES, COMBATING CLIMATE CHANGE, AND CONTROLLING THE TRADE IN GM PRODUCTS.     DEFENCE AND INTERNATIONAL INSTITUTIONS  INTERNATIONAL  BRITAIN CAN ACHIEVE FAR MORE BY WORKING WITH OTHERS THAN WORKING ALONE. AN INTERNATIONALIST APPROACH IS THE BEST WAY TO PROTECT OUR FREEDOM AND OUR INTERESTS AS. WE WILL WORK TO BUILD EFFECTIVE INTERNATIONAL AND REGIONAL ORGANISATIONS TO PROMOTE PEACE AND FREEDOM THROUGHOUT THE WORLD, COMBAT POVERTY AND DISEASE AND TACKLE GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL PROBLEMS.  LIBERAL DEMOCRATS WILL:  - PROMOTE A FOREIGN POLICY BASED ON DEMOCRACY, HUMAN RIGHTS AND GOOD GOVERNANCE  - SEEK TO MAKE INTERNATIONAL INSTITUTIONS MORE ABLE TO ADDRESS GLOBAL SECURITY, TRADE AND ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES  - RESIST FURTHER EROSION OF BRITAINS DEFENCE CAPABILITY WHILE CO-OPERATING MORE CLOSELY WITH THE COUNTRYS ALLIES     EVENTS IN ONE NATION CAN HAVE A PROFOUND IMPACT ON LIFE IN OTHER COUNTRIES. THE WORLD IS NO LONGER ONE OF SELF-CONTAINED NATION STATES. BRITAIN HAS TOO OFTEN GIVEN AID AND COMFORT TO AUTHORITARIAN REGIMES WHICH OPPRESS THEIR PEOPLE AND THREATEN WORLD STABILITY. AND AS BRITAINS OWN DEFENCE CAPABILITY HAS WEAKENED, THE COUNTRY HAS BEEN SLOW TO POOL RESOURCES WITH ITS ALLIES.     FOREIGN POLICY  BRITAIN STANDS AT THE CENTRE OF A WEB OF GLOBAL INSTITUTIONS. OUR MEMBERSHIP OF THE UN SECURITY COUNCIL, THE COMMONWEALTH, THE EU, NATO, AND OTHER GLOBAL BODIES GIVES BRITAIN A KEY ROLE IN WORLD AFFAIRS. BUT WITH POWER COMES RESPONSIBILITY.  WE MUST NOT TURN A BLIND EYE TO INJUSTICE, NOR SUPPORT AUTHORITARIAN REGIMES WHICH OPPRESS THEIR PEOPLE AND THREATEN WORLD STABILITY. BRITAINS INFLUENCE SHOULD BE USED TO FIGHT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS AND EQUITABLE AND PEACEFUL RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN NATIONS.  THE LIBERAL DEMOCRAT APPROACH PUTS DEMOCRATIC VALUES, HUMAN RIGHTS AND GOOD GOVERNANCE AT THE TOP OF THE FOREIGN POLICY AGENDA. WE WILL:  - END SUBSIDIES FOR ARMS SOLD TO FOREIGN REGIMES. WE WILL PUT AN END TO THE USE OF EXPORT CREDIT GUARANTEES TO SUPPORT ARMS EXPORTS. WE WILL ESTABLISH A PARLIAMENTARY ARMS EXPORT COMMITTEE TO MONITOR ARMS EXPORTS AND SCRUTINISE INDIVIDUAL LICENCE APPLICATIONS. WE WILL REQUIRE ARMS BROKERS TO REGISTER UNDER A CODE OF CONDUCT, AND REVOKE THE LICENCES OF THOSE WHO BREAK THE CODE.  - TAKE ACCOUNT OF HUMAN RIGHTS AND DEVELOPMENT NEEDS IN GOVERNMENT POLICY. WE WILL AUDIT RELEVANT GOVERNMENT DEPARTMENTS TO ENSURE THAT POLICIES ON ISSUES SUCH AS AID, ARMS SALES AND CREDIT GUARANTEES CONFORM TO THE STANDARDS WE HAVE SET.  - GIVE PRIORITY TO CONFLICT PREVENTION. IT SHOULD FOCUS ON TRADITIONAL THREATS TO SECURITY BUT ALSO THE CONSEQUENCES OF ENVIRONMENTAL DEGRADATION, RESOURCE DEPLETION, VOLATILE MARKETS AND UNFAIR TRADE. PREVENTIVE DIPLOMACY WILL BE GIVEN A HIGHER PRIORITY IN THE BUDGETS OF THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH OFFICE, DEPARTMENT FOR INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT AND MINISTRY OF DEFENCE.  - CONTINUE THE FIGHT AGAINST SLAVE LABOUR. WE WILL CO-OPERATE WITH INTERNATIONAL BODIES LIKE THE INTERNATIONAL LABOUR ORGANISATION TO STAMP OUT SLAVERY.  - MAINTAIN FUNDING FOR THE BBC WORLD SERVICE AND THE BRITISH COUNCIL. WE WILL ENSURE THAT THESE TWO ORGANISATIONS, WHICH HAVE A VITAL ROLE IN SPREADING THE VALUES OF FREEDOM AND DEMOCRACY, RECEIVE PROPER FUNDING.     INTERNATIONAL SECURITY  WE FAVOUR GREATER INTERNATIONAL CO-OPERATION TO MAKE THE WORLD A SAFER PLACE AND TO UPHOLD HUMAN RIGHTS IN OTHER COUNTRIES. WE WILL:  - SEEK TO STRENGTHEN THE POWERS OF THE UN. THE UN NEEDS A MORE ACTIVE ROLE IN HOLDING MEMBER STATES TO ACCOUNT FOR GROSS AND PERSISTENT BREACHES OF THE UNIVERSAL DECLARATION OF HUMAN RIGHTS. TOO MANY UN CONVENTIONS AND SECURITY COUNCIL RESOLUTIONS ARE FLOUTED AND IGNORED. WE PROPOSE THAT THE SECRETARY GENERAL CONDUCTS AN AUDIT TO DETERMINE OUTSTANDING OBLIGATIONS AND THE ACTION NEEDED TO COMPLY WITH THEM.  - ENSURE THAT THE UNITED NATIONS HAS THE RESOURCES TO ACT. WE WILL PROMOTE THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A STAFF COLLEGE BASED IN BRITAIN TO TRAIN UN PEACEKEEPERS. WE ALSO ADVOCATE THE FORMATION OF A UN RAPID REACTION DISASTER TASK FORCE TO TACKLE BOTH MAN-MADE AND NATURAL DISASTERS.  - WORK WITH BRITAINS PARTNERS IN THE COMMONWEALTH TO MAKE IT MORE EFFECTIVE IN PROMOTING CONFLICT RESOLUTION, GOOD GOVERNANCE AND DEMOCRATIC VALUES.  - SUPPORT THE INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL COURT. IF IT IS POWERFUL AND WELL RESOURCED, THE COURT WILL ENHANCE THE CAUSE OF HUMAN RIGHTS. WE WILL PRESS OPPONENTS OF THE COURT TO RECOGNISE ITS AUTHORITY.     DEFENCE  WE ARE PROUD OF BRITAIN'S RECORD OF DEFENDING DEMOCRACY AND TO REMEMBER THOSE WHO HAVE GIVEN THEIR LIVES, WE WILL MAKE THE DAY AFTER REMEMBRANCE SUNDAY A PUBLIC HOLIDAY. BRITISH ARMED FORCES RIGHTLY ENJOY THE RESPECT OF THE WORLD. IT IS ESSENTIAL TO PRESERVE THAT REPUTATION. BUT AS THE COUNTRYS OWN DEFENCE CAPABILITY HAS SHRUNK SINCE THE END OF THE COLD WAR, IT HAS BEEN SLOW TO POOL RESOURCES WITH ALLIES. BRITAINS CAPABILITIES MUST CONTINUE TO ADAPT TO MEET THE CHALLENGES OF THE 21ST CENTURY. WE WILL:  - RESIST FURTHER EROSION OF BRITAINS DEFENCE CAPABILITY. WE WILL MAINTAIN THE CURRENT LEVEL OF SPENDING AND RESIST ANY FURTHER REDUCTIONS.  - PROMOTE FLEXIBILITY, MOBILITY, RAPID DEPLOYMENT AND JOINT OPERATIONS AS THE BASIS OF BRITAINS DEFENCE POLICY, TO ENABLE THE UK TO HONOUR BRITAINS COMMITMENTS TO THE EU, NATO, THE COMMONWEALTH AND THE UN.  - PROMOTE EQUAL OPPORTUNITIES AND FAMILY WELFARE IN THE ARMED FORCES. WE WILL OPPOSE UNFAIR DISCRIMINATION IN THE FORCES. WE WILL REVIEW WELFARE POLICIES IN ORDER TO SET MINIMUM AND CONSISTENT STANDARDS THAT CAN BE APPLIED AT HOME AND ABROAD FOR SERVICE FAMILIES.  - WORK FOR THE ELIMINATION WORLDWIDE OF ALL NUCLEAR WEAPONS. WE WILL PRESS FOR A NEW ROUND OF MULTILATERAL ARMS REDUCTION TALKS, BUT WILL RETAIN THE UK'S MINIMUM NUCLEAR DETERRENT FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE.  - OPPOSE THE NATIONAL MISSILE DEFENCE SYSTEM (NMD). THE SYSTEM CURRENTLY BEING PROPOSED BY THE USA REPRESENTS A THREAT TO INTERNATIONAL STABILITY AND ARMS CONTROL AGREEMENTS.  - PUT IN PLACE A MORATORIUM ON THE USE OF DEPLETED URANIUM SHELLS UNTIL THERE IS CLEAR EVIDENCE REGARDING THE HEALTH RISKS INVOLVED.     TRADE, AID AND INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT  GENUINELY LIBERAL TRADE BENEFITS ALL THE COUNTRIES OF THE WORLD, RICH AND POOR. WE WILL PRESS FOR A FAIRER GLOBAL TRADING SYSTEM, AND DO MORE TO ASSIST POOR NATIONS. WE ADVOCATE EFFECTIVE AID POLICIES TO ADDRESS THE PROBLEMS OF DEVELOPING COUNTRIES AND PROMOTE DEMOCRACY AND GOOD GOVERNANCE. WE WILL:  - PROMOTE GENUINE LIBERAL TRADE. THE REMOVAL OF BARRIERS TO TRADE HAS STIMULATED ECONOMIC GROWTH AND PROSPERITY THROUGHOUT MUCH OF THE WORLD, AND THE WORLD TRADE ORGANISATION HAS HELPED ESTABLISH AND MAINTAIN INTERNATIONAL RULES WHICH GUARANTEE EQUAL TREATMENT FOR ALL MEMBERS, LARGE OR SMALL. HOWEVER, TRADE LIBERALISATION HAS SOMETIMES BEEN PURSUED AT THE EXPENSE OF OTHER OBJECTIVES, SUCH AS ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION OR PUBLIC HEALTH. WE WILL WORK TO REFORM THE WTO SO THAT ENVIRONMENTAL OBJECTIVES AND PRINCIPLES ARE FULLY INTEGRATED INTO ITS ACTIVITIES AND POORER COUNTRIES ARE HELPED TO PARTICIPATE FULLY WITHIN IT.  - ENCOURAGE FAIR COMPETITION. WE WOULD PRESS FOR A GLOBAL COMPETITION AUTHORITY WITHIN THE WTO TO ENCOURAGE CO-ORDINATION OF THE ANTI-MONOPOLY ACTIVITIES OF INDIVIDUAL NATIONS TO TACKLE THE GROWING CONCENTRATION OF CORPORATE MONOPOLY POWER MORE EFFECTIVELY. WE WANT WORLD-WIDE AGREEMENT TO REDUCE SUBSIDIES, COMMON IN AREAS SUCH AS FOSSIL FUEL PRODUCTION, AGRICULTURE, FORESTRY AND FISHERIES: THIS WOULD ENCOURAGE TRADE, OPEN MARKETS TO POORER COUNTRIES EXPORTS AND REDUCE ENVIRONMENTAL DAMAGE.  - HONOUR THE UK'S COMMITMENT TO MEET THE UN TARGET OF INCREASING OVERSEAS AID TO 0.7% OVER THE NEXT TEN YEARS. WE SUPPORT THE MOVES ALREADY MADE BY THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT TO REDUCE THE DEBTS OF THE POOREST COUNTRIES. BUT BRITAIN COULD LEAD MORE RAPID ACTION ON DEBT RELIEF BY BODIES SUCH AS THE INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND AND THE WORLD BANK. THEIR POVERTY REDUCTION STRATEGY PROGRAMMES SHOULD ATTACH AT LEAST AS MUCH IMPORTANCE TO GOVERNMENTS TAKING ACTION TO TACKLE POVERTY AS TO LIBERALISING THEIR ECONOMIES.  - END LINKS BETWEEN AID AND TRADE. TIED AID IS A FORM OF PROTECTIONISM WHICH INHIBITS DEVELOPMENT. WE WILL SUBJECT ALL AID PROGRAMMES TO THOROUGH ASSESSMENT FOR THEIR ENVIRONMENTAL, SOCIAL AND HUMAN RIGHTS CONSEQUENCES.  - DIRECT AID TOWARDS WOMEN. WOMEN IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES FACE DISCRIMINATION AND ECONOMIC EXCLUSION. ALL AID PACKAGES SHOULD ADDRESS GENDER INEQUALITY, WITH A HIGH PRIORITY FOR FAMILY PLANNING AND MATERNAL HEALTH SERVICES.  - STEP UP THE FIGHT AGAINST HIV/AIDS. THE AIDS PANDEMIC IS A GLOBAL EMERGENCY WHICH UNDERMINES ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AND THREATENS INTERNATIONAL SECURITY. WE WILL INCREASE BACKING FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF AN AIDS VACCINE. WORKING WITH BODIES SUCH AS THE CHURCHES, WE WILL SUPPORT LARGE-SCALE AIDS/HIV EDUCATION PROGRAMMES AND PRESS FOR MOTHER-TO-CHILD AIDS TREATMENT DRUGS TO BE MADE AVAILABLE CHEAPLY.  - PROMOTE UNIVERSAL PRIMARY EDUCATION. EDUCATION IS ESSENTIAL TO ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT. WE WILL SPEARHEAD INITIATIVES TO INCREASE THE RESOURCES FOR BASIC EDUCATION IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES. IN RETURN FOR FINANCIAL SUPPORT RECIPIENT COUNTRIES SHOULD BE OBLIGED TO REDUCE EXPENDITURE ON ARMS.  - IMPLEMENT THE OECD CONVENTION ON BRIBERY. WE WILL ALLOW UK REGISTERED COMPANIES TO BE PROSECUTED FOR BRIBERY OFFENCES COMMITTED OVERSEAS.     SETTING YOU FREE  - STOP USING TAXPAYERS MONEY TO SUPPORT THE ARMS TRADE  BY ENDING SUBSIDIES FOR ARMS SOLD TO FOREIGN REGIMES.     GREEN ACTION  GLOBAL CLIMATE CHANGE  WE WILL PLACE BRITAIN AT THE FOREFRONT OF CLIMATE CHANGE NEGOTIATIONS, PRESSING OTHER NATIONS TO RATIFY AND IMPLEMENT THE 1997 KYOTO PROTOCOL BY THE RIO+10 WORLD SUMMIT IN MID 2002. WE WILL SEEK TO EXTEND ITS TERMS AND TARGETS FURTHER. WE WILL ENSURE THAT BRITAIN ACHIEVES ITS TARGET WELL BEFORE THE DEADLINE, AND ESTABLISHES A NEW TARGET OF A 20% REDUCTION IN CO~2~ EMISSIONS BY 2010.  INTRODUCE STRONGER ENVIRONMENTAL OBJECTIVES  WE WILL CAMPAIGN TO INTRODUCE STRONGER ENVIRONMENTAL OBJECTIVES INTO THE COMMON AGRICULTURAL POLICY, LENDING AND INVESTMENT POLICIES OF THE IMF, WORLD BANK AND REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT BANKS. WTO RULES SHOULD RESPECT ENVIRONMENTAL PRINCIPLES AS LONG AS THESE ARE APPLIED IN A NON-PROTECTIONIST WAY.  PROMOTE SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT  WE WILL ENSURE THAT ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIAL SUSTAINABILITY IS A PRIME OBJECTIVE OF AID AND TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER POLICIES.  IMPROVE ENVIRONMENTAL GOVERNANCE  THE RIO+10 SUMMIT IN 2002 IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO IMPROVE THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITYS ABILITY TO TACKLE ENVIRONMENTAL THREATS. WE WANT A SUBSTANTIAL INCREASE IN RESOURCES FOR THE UN ENVIRONMENT PROGRAMME AND FOR THE IMPLEMENTATION OF ENVIRONMENTAL AGREEMENTS. WE ALSO ADVOCATE A UN ECONOMIC AND ENVIRONMENTAL SECURITY COUNCIL FOR SUSTAINABILITY.     BRITAIN'S ECONOMY  FREEDOM TO THRIVE     NO GOVERNMENT CAN DELIVER FREEDOM WITHOUT CREATING A SOUND AND SUSTAINABLE ECONOMY, IN WHICH BUSINESS CAN THRIVE, THE ENVIRONMENT IS SAFEGUARDED AND EMPLOYEES ARE PROPERLY PROTECTED, NATIONALLY AND INTERNATIONALLY.     LIBERAL DEMOCRATS WILL:  - CREATE A COMPETITIVE AND SOUND ECONOMY TO DELIVER PROSPERITY FOR ALL  - ENABLE BRITISH EURO ENTRY, SUBJECT TO THE DECISION OF THE BRITISH PEOPLE IN A REFERENDUM  - MAKE TAXATION AND SPENDING POLICIES CLEARER AND MORE ACCOUNTABLE  - STRENGTHEN THE INDEPENDENCE OF THE BANK OF ENGLAND  THE CONSERVATIVES WERE INCOMPETENT STEWARDS OF THE BRITISH ECONOMY. THE THATCHER AND MAJOR YEARS WENT FROM BOOM TO BUST TO BOOM AND BUST AGAIN. WHILE SOME MADE THEIR FORTUNES, SECTORS OF THE ECONOMY SUCH AS MANUFACTURING AND FARMING SUFFERED A STEADY DECLINE. THE CONSERVATIVES FAILED TO MAKE THE PUBLIC INVESTMENT NEEDED FOR THE LONG TERM, STARVING SCHOOLS, TRAINING AND THE TRANSPORT SYSTEM.  LABOUR HAS DONE TOO LITTLE TO REDRESS THE MISTAKES OF THE CONSERVATIVES. THEY WERE TOO TIMID IN THEIR FIRST THREE YEARS IN POWER, FAILING TO RECOGNISE THE VERY POOR STATE OF THE PUBLIC SECTOR.  A COMPETITIVE AND SOUND ECONOMY  LABOUR HAVE BEEN TIMID OVER THE EURO, LEAVING MANUFACTURING, FARMING AND TOURISM TO SUFFER THE EFFECTS OF AN UNCOMPETITIVELY HIGH VALUE OF THE POUND. WE WILL:  - CREATE A COMPETITIVE AND SOUND ECONOMY, ENABLING BRITISH EURO ENTRY SUBJECT TO THE DECISION OF THE BRITISH PEOPLE IN A REFERENDUM. MEMBERSHIP OF THE EURO AT A COMPETITIVE AND SUSTAINABLE RATE WOULD OFFER BRITAIN CONSIDERABLE BENEFITS. IT WOULD END THE EXCHANGE RATE INSTABILITY WHICH HAS DESTROYED MANY THOUSANDS OF JOBS, SAFEGUARD THE INVESTMENT IN HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF FURTHER JOBS BY OVERSEAS FIRMS, AND REDUCE THE COSTS OF TRADE WITH THE REST OF THE EU. UNLIKE THE CONSERVATIVES, WE BELIEVE THE BRITISH PEOPLE DESERVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE THEIR SAY IN A REFERENDUM.  - ENCOURAGE SUSTAINABLE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT. WE WILL GIVE LOCAL AUTHORITIES GREATER POWERS TO BORROW AND INVEST FOR LOCAL DEVELOPMENT, ENCOURAGE THE USE OF LOCAL EXCHANGE AND TRADING SYSTEMS, AND PROMOTE VOLUNTEERING.  - IMPROVE THE INFRASTRUCTURE OF THE NATIONS AND REGIONS OF THE UK. WE WOULD ALLOW THE SCOTTISH PARLIAMENT, THE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY FOR WALES, THE NORTHERN IRELAND ASSEMBLY, THE ENGLISH REGIONS AND LOCAL AUTHORITIES TO BORROW FOR INVESTMENT DIRECTLY FROM THE MARKET, SUBJECT TO RULES SIMILAR TO THOSE ALREADY ESTABLISHED FOR CENTRAL GOVERNMENT.     OPEN AND HONEST TAXES  SCHOOLS, HOSPITALS, PENSIONS AND THE POLICE DESPERATELY NEED FURTHER INVESTMENT, AND THIS IS OUR PRIORITY. WE WILL BE HONEST ABOUT THE COST OF THE INVESTMENT WE WISH TO MAKE AND CLEAR ABOUT THE BENEFITS THIS WILL BRING. WE WILL:  - PROVIDE IMPROVEMENTS IN EDUCATION COSTING MORE THAN £3 BILLION A YEAR, FUNDED BY PUTTING ONE PENNY ON THE BASIC RATE OF INCOME TAX.  - PROVIDE SUBSTANTIAL IMMEDIATE INCREASES IN PENSIONS AND RAISE INVESTMENT IN THE NHS, FUNDED BY SETTING A NEW TOP TAX RATE OF 50% ON INCOME OVER £100,000 A YEAR AND BY CLOSING LOOPHOLES IN CAPITAL GAINS TAX. TO PUT THIS MEASURE INTO PERSPECTIVE, FOR MOST OF THE THATCHER YEARS THE TOP RATE WAS 60%, STARTING ON SUBSTANTIALLY LOWER INCOMES.  - INVEST IN THE POLICE AND PUBLIC TRANSPORT BY CLOSING LOOPHOLES IN CAPITAL GAINS TAX (CGT). WE WILL ABOLISH THE CGT EXEMPTION ON CAPITAL GAINS HELD AT DEATH (BUT MAINTAIN THE PRESENT EXEMPTIONS FOR TRANSFERS BETWEEN SPOUSES, AND REINTRODUCE INDEXATION AND RETIREMENT RELIEF) AND ABOLISH THE COMPLEX CGT TAPER INTRODUCED BY GORDON BROWN.  - SEND EACH HOUSEHOLD AN ANNUAL CITIZEN'S TAX CONTRACT. THIS WOULD SHOW IN SIMPLE TERMS HOW MUCH TAX IS BEING RAISED, WHAT SERVICES ARE BEING DELIVERED AND WHY CHANGES HAVE BEEN MADE. IT WOULD OBLIGE CENTRAL GOVERNMENT TO PROVIDE THE KIND OF INFORMATION ABOUT EXPENDITURE AND TAXATION WHICH LOCAL GOVERNMENT ALREADY SENDS OUT WITH COUNCIL TAX BILLS. PEOPLE WILL HAVE A RIGHT TO KNOW HOW THEIR TAXES ARE BEING USED AND WHY.  - MAKE TAXATION AND SPENDING POLICIES CLEARER AND MORE ACCOUNTABLE. WE WILL REQUIRE AN ANNUAL FISCAL ASSESSMENT TO BE PUBLISHED SIXTY DAYS BEFORE EVERY BUDGET BY THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE OF THE BANK OF ENGLAND. IT WOULD SET OUT THE CURRENT EFFECT OF TAX POLICY ON INTEREST RATES, AND THE ANTICIPATED IMPACT IN THE YEAR AHEAD OF EXISTING PLANS AND LIKELY ALTERNATIVES. THIS WOULD MAKE FISCAL POLICY MORE TRANSPARENT AND OPEN.  - PROMOTE BETTER VALUE FOR MONEY. TOO MANY GOVERNMENT PROGRAMMES HAVE BEEN INTRODUCED IN THE PAST WITHOUT PROPER ANALYSIS OF PILOT PROJECTS. WE WILL USE EVIDENCE-BASED POLICY MAKING TO GIVE THE TAXPAYER BETTER VALUE FOR MONEY.     AS RESOURCES ALLOW, WE PLAN TO:  - GIVE TAXPAYERS GREATER CHOICE OVER HOW TAXES ARE SPENT. TAXPAYERS IN EACH OF THE NATIONS OF THE UK WILL BE GIVEN A SERIES OF SPECIFIC INVESTMENT OPTIONS AND WILL BE ABLE TO EXPRESS THEIR CHOICE BY RETURNING A TEAR-OFF SLIP FROM THEIR ANNUAL P60 FORMS. THEY WOULD BE GIVEN THE OPPORTUNITY, SAY, TO CHOOSE TO GIVE 1% OF INCOME TAX (CURRENTLY AROUND £1 BILLION) MONEY TO HOSPITALS OR SCHOOLS. THIS MEASURE WILL BE INTRODUCED WHEN REVENUES ALLOW FOLLOWING CONSULTATION BETWEEN THE UK GOVERNMENT AND THE NATIONS AND REGIONS OF THE UK.  - REMOVE TAXATION FOR THE LOWEST PAID. WE BELIEVE THAT PEOPLE START PAYING TAX AT TOO LOW A LEVEL AND WILL WORK TO REDUCE THE BURDEN OF TAXATION ON THE LOW PAID. OVER TIME, WE WILL CUT THE 10P TAX RATE TO ZERO SO NOBODY PAYS ANY TAX ON THEIR EARNINGS UP TO £6,500. AT PRESENT, THIS WOULD TAKE 1.4 MILLION PEOPLE ON LOW INCOMES (1.1 MILLION OF WHOM ARE WOMEN) OUT OF TAX ALTOGETHER. ANYONE EARNING LESS THAN £25,000 WOULD PAY LESS TAX  EVEN ALLOWING FOR OUR 1P ON EDUCATION.     SETTING YOU FREE  - STRENGTHEN THE INDEPENDENCE OF THE BANK OF ENGLAND. THE LIBERAL DEMOCRATS WERE THE ONLY PARTY TO PROPOSE INDEPENDENCE FOR THE BANK AT THE LAST ELECTION. LABOUR ADOPTED OUR PROPOSAL, BUT WE WOULD GO FURTHER. WE WILL MAKE MEMBERS OF THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE MORE INDEPENDENT BY GIVING THEM NON-RENEWABLE TERMS AND MAKING THEM MORE REPRESENTATIVE OF THE UK AS A WHOLE. WE WILL ALSO MAKE THE APPOINTMENTS SYSTEM MORE OPEN AND TRANSPARENT.  GREEN ACTION  GREENING THE BUDGET  WE WILL PUBLISH A FULL GREEN BUDGET ASSESSMENT OF EVERY BUDGET. THIS WILL ENSURE THAT ENVIRONMENTAL PRIORITIES ARE AT THE HEART OF GOVERNMENT SPENDING PLANS, AND THAT THE CHANCELLOR IS HELD TO ACCOUNT FOR MAKING ECONOMIC POLICY MORE SUSTAINABLE.  MAKING THE POLLUTER PAY  WE REGARD IT AS ESSENTIAL TO MAKE A MAJOR SHIFT IN TAXATION FROM GOODS LIKE WEALTH CREATION WHICH BENEFIT BRITAIN TO BADS WHICH ARE HARMFUL LIKE POLLUTION. WE ALSO WANT TO SUPPORT GREEN TECHNOLOGY AND NEW ENVIRONMENTAL INDUSTRIES. WE WILL ESTABLISH A GREEN TAX COMMISSION TO MAKE CLEAR RECOMMENDATIONS ON REFORMING THE TAX SYSTEM, GUARANTEEING THAT INCREASES IN ENVIRONMENTAL TAXES WILL BE MATCHED BY TAX CUTS ELSEWHERE. GREEN TAXATION WILL INVOLVE TAXING DIFFERENTLY, NOT TAXING MORE."
"Conservatives",200106,"time for common sense - the Conservative manifesto  introduction  through our lives:  * raising a family  * living safely  * earning a living  * staying healthy  * growing older  knowing who we are:  * a world leader  * a stronger society  * town and country  * a civilised country  * a proud democracy  conclusion  time for common sense  introduction  We present here the most ambitious Conservative programme for a generation.  Its aim is to release the wisdom, decency and enterprise of British citizens. We can achieve that by handing back to individuals and families the ability to shape their own lives and communities.  We will free entrepreneurs to build businesses and to create prosperity, free those who use public services to choose what is best for them and free those who work in our schools and hospitals and police service from endless political interference.  We want to set people free so that they have greater power over their own lives. That is what I have always believed.  But there is something else too. I value those aspects of our national life which are bigger than individuals and families. That is why we will nurture our towns and cities, our countryside, our local institutions, our charities, our democracy -- for they make us who we are as a nation.  Our programme is rooted in the instincts of millions of people whose beliefs are mocked by Labour. It is rooted, in other words, in common sense.  It shouldn't be necessary to make an appeal to common sense.Yet the common sense wisdom of the mainstream majority, on crime, or on taxes, or the family, or on Europe, is under threat as never before.  Labour does not understand our country and cannot value what it cannot understand.  This meddling and interfering Government is eroding our freedoms as well as weakening the institutions that give us a sense of common purpose.  At this Election Britain has a choice between a Labour Party that trusts government instead of people and a Conservative Party that trusts people instead of government.  I trust the British people.  I trust their common sense.  It's time for common sense.  through our lives  raising a family  Common sense means strengthening the family  * Less tax for families  * Support for marriage  * Freedom for headteachers and governors to run their own schools  * Power for parents to change management of failing schools  * Endowed universities and less onerous student loan repayments  Families feel more than ever that they are struggling to bring up their children in an environment that is hostile.  They feel it is getting harder to make ends meet, especially when their children are very young. They feel the Government only values childcare if someone else is paid to provide it, and that it doesn't value marriage at all. They feel that they are paying a fortune in tax, but they aren't getting the education they want for their children.  They also worry that, however hard they try to bring up their children well, the dangers of being drawn into crime and drug use are growing. And they fear that passing our values on from one generation to the next is harder than ever.  It's time for common sense.  Conservatives will help families bringing up children. We will let families keep more of what they earn. We will support marriage. We will provide choice and high standards in schools. And we will help parents who feel they aren't getting enough help at the time they need it the most.  We will introduce a new Married Couple's Allowance which will give a tax cut worth £1,000 to many families when they need help most.  Cutting tax for families  The task of bringing up children is made much harder when families keep less of what they earn, because the Government is taking more.  Labour have increased taxes on hardworking families. After four years of Labour, a typical family was paying £670 more tax per year than when the Government took office.  Despite all the evidence that marriage provides the best environment for bringing up children, married couples do not fit into Labour's politically correct agenda. That is why they have penalised millions of families by abolishing the Married Couple's Tax Allowance.  Conservatives will give families a break.  We will cut taxes on families with children under 5 by increasing the Children's Tax Credit by £200 a year. This means an extra £4 a week will be taken off the tax bill of most families with young children, in addition to what they receive in Child Benefit.  The arrival of children often puts a family under particular pressure. One parent may give up work for a while, reducing the couple's income just when their expenses are greatest.  A Conservative government will support families coping with these pressures.  We will introduce a new Married Couple's Allowance which will give a tax cut worth £1,000 to many families when they need help most. If someone is not using all or part of their personal tax allowance they will be able to transfer it to a working spouse if they have children under 11 or receive Invalid Care Allowance in respect of a relative.  Mothers or fathers who stop working to care for children can sometimes find it difficult to get back into paid  work afterwards. This is where our Family Scholarships scheme will help. Parents who have taken time out  from their careers in order to care for their children will be able to apply for a scholarship to help them undertake vocational or professional training.  Widows and widowers find supporting children particularly difficult. Conservatives will give extra help to all widows and widowers with dependent children by removing tax on the Widowed Mother's Allowance and the new Widowed Parent's Allowance. This will provide a valuable increase of up to £20 per week in widowed parents'income.  It is right to boost the incomes of families with modest earnings. We will reform the Working Families Tax Credit so it is once more paid as a benefit direct to the caring parent. Up to 400,000 mothers will gain from this reform.  More choice and higher standards in schools  The least parents should expect from all the taxes they pay is a decent school for their children.  Labour promised much on education, but after four years in power they have failed to deliver. That failure is no accident. It is because Labour have tried to run the nation's schools from Whitehall.  Conservatives will pursue a very different policy.  Our objective is to give parents choice, and headteachers freedom. These reforms will lead to schools of the sort parents want - schools with high standards, schools which have their own traditions, a distinct ethos and which wear their school uniform with pride.  Headteachers and their staff cannot command respect in their own schools if they are treated as mere branch managers on the receiving end of instructions from the council or from Whitehall. And teachers are leaving the profession in droves because of all the pointless paperwork.  That is why it's time for common sense.  Conservatives will introduce ""Free Schools"". We will free every school in the country from bureaucratic control and allow them to shape their own character.  Heads and Governors will have complete responsibility for running their schools. They will be able to choose how to reward excellence amongst their teachers. And they will be able to use, as a criterion for admission, the willingness of a pupil or parent to subscribe to a home-school agreement which sets out the responsibilities of students and their school to each other.  We will abolish the nonsensical rules that make it difficult for Heads to exclude disruptive pupils - we will not allow a few unruly pupils to damage the education of everyone else.  Instead, we will set up Progress Centres outside the schools. These Centres will make sure disruptive pupils get specialist help to overcome their problems so that where possible they may return to mainstream schools.  We plan to spend what the Government has planned. But with us more of the money will actually get to the schools. We will save money currently wasted on government and council bureaucracy, giving this money directly to schools according to the number of pupils. By doing that each school would have received, on average, an extra £540 per pupil in 1999/2000 to spend on its own priorities.  Britain has some excellent schools. Often they are next door to mediocre ones. Nothing is more frustrating for parents than to be told that they cannot send their child to the school of their choice because its numbers are artificially restricted in order to keep up numbers at a weaker school. So we will abolish the rule that stops successful schools from expanding to take more pupils. More parents will get their first choice of school for their children.  Letting our best schools expand isn't enough. We want to see good new schools springing up. We will allow churches and other faith communities, groups of parents, charitable foundations and companies to set up new schools. They will be entitled to per-pupil funding in the same way as existing schools, and will be subject to the same standards and inspections.  The people who are most likely to realise that a school has problems are not officials in a distant bureaucracy but the parents of children at the school.  Conservatives will give parents the right to call for a special Ofsted inspection if they fear that their child's school is failing. If the inspectors confirm their view, the school's management will have to be changed. This is our Parent's Guarantee.  We will let families keep more of what they earn. We will support marriage. We will provide choice and high standards in schools  Reducing barriers for students  Students feel particularly aggrieved because Labour broke the promises they made to them at the last election.  Good students are put off going to college because they will be burdened by loans that must be repaid even when their income is relatively low.  Some are deterred from taking vital jobs, in teaching or in the health service, because of the cost of their student loans.  Under Labour, student loans must be repaid as soon as a graduate's income reaches £10,000 per year. With us, graduates will not have to pay anything unless and until their income tops £20,000 per year. And we will not introduce top-up fees.  Freeing our universities  Our universities used to be the best in the world. Many of them still have a formidable reputation, but they are under threat from interference by politicians and uncertainty over their funding.  Conservatives want our universities to be free to shape their own character and specialisms, competing with the world's best for students and research funding.  To achieve their independence they need to have their own resources. We will therefore create permanent endowment funds for Britain's universities.  through our lives  living safely  Common sense means having enough police to keep our streets safe and a criminal justice system that reflects our values rather than undermines them  * Increase police numbers  * Free police from bureaucracy so that they can get on with policing  * Take persistent young offenders off our streets  * Criminals to serve the sentence given by the court  * More rights for victim  We may have grown more prosperous as a nation, but the quality of our life is still impoverished by crime.  Decent people, who work hard and who obey the law, are outraged that criminals seem free to make their lives a misery.  Labour have talked tough on law and order but they have failed to deliver. Police numbers have fallen, and violent crime is on the rise.  It's time for common sense.  Conservatives will trust the instincts of the mainstream majority on law and order. That means more police and less bureaucracy holding them back. It also means tougher sentences for some crimes and more honest sentencing for all crimes.  Its time to stop turning a blind eye to crimes committed by young offenders and ensure instead that they are put back on the right track.  More police, tougher sentences  Conservatives will increase the number of police officers on our streets by reversing the cuts in police numbers that  Labour have made.  We will free the police to get on with policing rather than paperwork. Weighed down by regulations and under heavy political attack, police morale has fallen to its lowest point for many years. We must raise police morale. We will work with police forces to cut out bureaucracy, and to devolve work that doesn't have to be carried out by the police to other bodies.  People feel safer if they see police officers around.  So we will implement our ""cops in shops""initiative - getting paperwork done in visible places on the beat and not back in the station. And we will encourage parish and town councils to create an additional new role, that of the parish constable.  Under the Conservatives, the police will be encouraged to combat loutish behaviour, graffiti, and vandalism which destroy the quality of every day life for millions of people.  A hard core of persistent young offenders commit a disproportionate number of crimes. They offend again and again, laughing at the law and making their neighbours'lives a misery.  It's time to stop turning a blind eye to crimes committed by young offenders and ensure instead that they are put back on the right track.  We will increase tenfold the number of places in Secure Training Centres - taking persistent young menaces off our streets for at least 6 months. We will link their release date to the attainment of objectives such as a recognised qualification or standard of behaviour.  Drugs are now blighting even our rural communities, ruining lives and causing a wave of other crimes like burglary and mugging. Conservatives will give the police new powers to crack down on drug dealers.  Most evil of all are the drug dealers who try to lure children into addiction. We will give a mandatory prison sentence to dealers convicted of selling drugs to under-16s. And, in sentencing drug-pushers, judges will be allowed to take into account, as an aggravating factor, any dealing done in the vicinity of schools.  Conservatives will end the nonsense whereby criminals know full well they will serve only a fraction of the prison sentence handed down by a judge.  We will introduce honesty in sentencing so that the sentence handed down in court is the one served by the criminal. We will abolish Labour's special early release scheme as well as automatic early release and ensure that any discounts from the sentence are transparent, have to be earned and are neither automatic nor substantial.  Prison life should not be a life of idleness. Under the Conservatives, prisoners will be required to perform a proper day's work. The proceeds will contribute to reparations for their victims and to the upkeep of their own families. And prisoners will learn the habit of working, just as everyone else has to do each day.  Sex offenders who have been released can now only be supervised for a maximum of 10 years. Courts should be able to place sex offenders under supervision for life. We will also introduce new laws to protect children from paedophiles who use internet chat rooms.  Victims first  Too often criminals seem to enjoy more rights than their victims. Conservatives will make sure that the justice system treats victims fairly.  A named police officer who is working on their case will be identified to each victim, and they will have a similar continuous point of contact in the Crown Prosecution Service. Both the police and the CPS will be required to keep the victim informed as the investigation and prosecution progress and written reasons must be given where charges are dropped or reduced.  We will also overhaul the law so that it is on the side of the victim not the criminal. This will include the law on self defence and the double jeopardy rule.  Conservatives will increase the number of police officers on our streets  Average sentences, and average time served on Labour's special early release scheme 1999-2001:  Robbery:  average sentence: 2 years 2 months  average time served: 11 months  Inflicting Grievous Bodily Harm:  average sentence: 1 year 7 months  average time served: 8 months  Assault on a police officer:  average sentence: 5 months  average time served: 6 weeks  Since 1997-98 violent crime has risen by 15 per cent.  We could all make a list of the additional paperwork that creates a bureaucratic nightmare for officers who want to spend more time actually delivering the goods...The situation is far more frustrating nowadays than at any time in my 28 years' service.The public is getting a raw deal  A Chief Inspector of Police  through our lives  earning a living  Common sense means less tax and regulation for people and businesses  * Lower taxes for businesses, families, savers, pensioners and motorists  * Public spending not to outstrip the growth of the economy  * No more stealth taxes - transparent economic policy  * Cut the cost of regulation on business every year  * Keep the pound  It is getting harder for people and businesses in Britain to earn a living.  It should be getting easier. The tough decisions and hard choices made by the British people and Conservative  Governments in the 1980s and 1990s transformed our economic prospects, and made Britain's businesses competitive.  But instead of advancing further we are slipping back. People who have to watch every penny, see more and more of their money taken by the Government. Businesses are spending too much time dealing with new regulations, with too little time to focus on their customers.  It would be disastrous to re-elect a Government whose central economic policy is to increase tax and regulation by stealth.  It's time for common sense.  We will cut taxes on people and businesses and cut government interference and regulation in order to match  the competition in the global marketplace.  Lower taxes  All over the world, governments of all political persuasions are cutting taxes on people and businesses.  Yet Britain is going in the opposite direction. Labour promised not to raise taxes. They have broken that promise. Experts have catalogued forty-five separate tax increases since 1997.  Labour have said that, if they were re-elected, they would increase spending each year faster than the growth of our national income. That inevitably means even higher taxes.  Higher taxes come naturally to Labour, because they don't trust people to spend their own money.  Conservatives do trust people to spend their own money, and we will therefore pursue a very different policy.  We will be a tax-cutting government.  Each year, as the economy grows, we can spend more on vital public services, but also allow people to keep more  of their own money. We will improve the performance of government and make policy changes so that after two years we will be able to save £8 billion a year compared to Labour's plans. These changes do not affect schools, the NHS, police or defence.  We will return this £8 billion to people in tax cuts - set out throughout this manifesto - targeted to help those who have been hit hardest by Labour's tax increases.  Conservatives understand that our circumstances change through our lives - most of us face financial pressures when we have young children, for example, or find ourselves living on a fixed income in old age. So we will carefully target tax cuts to help people at times in their lives when they need it most, when they are struggling hard with difficult responsibilities.  This is not the end of our tax cutting ambitions. With proper control of government spending in the second half of the next Parliament we can cut taxes further. Among our priorities will be to raise the Inheritance Tax threshold and to raise the threshold at which people begin to pay higher rate income tax, because it currently catches people who are not, by any definition, rich.  Conservative tax cuts  Abolish taxes on savings and dividends £3 billion  Raise Personal Allowance for pensioners by £2,000 £0.8 billion  Increase Children's Tax Credit by £200 a year for families with children under the age of 5 £0.3 billion  Abolish tax on Widowed Mother's Allowance and Widowed Parent's Allowance £0.1 billion  Introduce a new Married Couple's Allowance £1 billion  Cut petrol tax by at least 6p per litre £2.2 billion  Tax relief on Approved Share Options £0.1 billion  Regeneration Tax Breaks £0.2 billion  Business Rates reductions £0.2 billion  Abolish IR35 £0.1 billion  The tax burden has risen under Labour by 3 per cent of GDP from 35.2 per cent in 1996/97 to 38.2 per cent in 2000/01 - that is the equivalent of 10p on the basic rate of income tax.  Clearer and simpler taxes  Labour have tried to disguise their tax increases by introducing new stealth taxes and making the tax system more complex. We want people to be able to see how much they pay in tax, and to see it come down. We will run the economy with discipline, and discipline requires transparency. So we will send every taxpayer a clear statement of how the Government raises money and then spends it.  We will create a National Accounts Commission to set standardsof transparency for the public accounts and stop politicians from meddling with them for their own ends.  We need simpler taxes, too. Capital Gains Tax, for example, is exactly what a tax ought not to be - at a high rate with lots of complicated exemptions. Capital Gains Tax should be simplified, allowances removed and the rate cut. The experience of the US and Ireland is that this stimulates enterprise and tax revenues rise.  Conservatives will repeal the tax on IT consultants, the notorious IR35, which has driven away from Britain some of our most productive workers. We will replace it with targeted anti-avoidance measures.  Less regulation  Regulation is the new way Labour politicians control the economy. Businesses they wouldn't dream of nationalising, they regulate.  It has the same consequences: the judgment of politicians and civil servants is substituted for that of owners and entrepreneurs.  So a Conservative Government will cut the burden of regulation and free businesses to serve their customers rather than serving their regulators.Governments are held to account for the taxpayers' money they spend. We think they should be similarly held responsible for the other costs they impose on businesses. All new regulations will have to be scrutinised by a new Deregulation Commission, which will have the power to send them to Parliament for full debate. And the Commission will calculate, through an independent audit, the cost of government regulations for business. It will then set regulatory budgets for each government department alongside their financial budgets. We will bring these regulatory budgets down, year after year. The burden of regulation has ratcheted up for far too long. We will reverse it.  Small businesses will be exempt from some regulations altogether.  Britain has been ahead of the field in the information economy because we created an environment of low taxes and light regulation. But now we are losing that advantage fast. We don't need more regulations, we need more competition. The utility regulators must focus on competition and address the market dominance of incumbents which stand in the way of competition.  We will abolish Labour's Climate Change Levy package. The necessary carbon dioxide reduction can be achieved far more efficiently by other means. We will also review the future of nuclear energy and its role in contributing to reductions in CO2 emissions.  £8 billion of Conservative savings  Social Security  £2.5 billion  We will reform welfare to reduce dependency and create a national anti-benefit fraud squad with new powers.  Dept of Environment, Transport & The Regions  £1 billion  We will abolish regional bureaucracy, cut local government red tape and renovate council housing by transferring it to the voluntary sector.  Dept of Trade & Industry  £0.3 billion  We will slim down the DTI and improve its effectiveness for business.  Reversing the growth in government bureaucracy  £1.8 billion  We will return the cost of government to the level at which we maintained it during the last Conservative Government.  Britain Works  £0.6 billion  We will replace the failing New Deal with Britain Works and contract out the job-finding work of the Employment Service.  Creation of a Community Legal Aid Fund  £0.3 billion  We will reform legal aid by creating a new Community Legal Aid Fund. In return for financing civil cases, the Fund will receive a portion of the damages when its clients win.  Endowing Universities  £1.3 billion  We will free universities from reliance on state funding and provide endowments paid for by future asset sales and the reform of student loans.  Endowing Britains culture  £0.2 billion  We will privatise Channel 4 and give the money to cultural institutions like museums and galleries so they are more independent of the state.  Total - £8 billion  We will cut taxes on people and businesses and cut government interference and regulation in order to match the competition in the global marketplace.  Five disciplines for a sound economy  The next Conservative Government will operate within a sound and stable financial framework based on five disciplines.  * We will keep the pound. Labour's plan for early entry into the euro is the single biggest threat to our economic stability. By keeping the pound we will keep control of our economic policy, including the ability to set interest rates to suit British economic conditions.  * We will enhance the independence of the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee.  * We will set up a Council of Economic Advisers, which will comment publicly on whether the balance between spending and taxes represents a prudent approach to the national finances, and is helping secure low inflation and low interest rates.  * We will appoint a National Accounts Commission to draw up proper national accounts, including a proper presentation of the Government's long term liabilities.  * We will plot a course away from the direction in which the Chancellor is leading us, and towards real annual increases in spending which are within the trend rate of growth of the economy.  through our lives  staying healthy  Common sense means ending political interference in medical judgments and giving choice to patients  * Increase funding for NHS  * Trust doctors and nurses, not politicians, to make medical decisions  * Give patients and GPs the right to choose in which hospital to be treated  * Remove tax penalty on private medical insurance  * Guaranteed limits on waiting times for patients  The National Health Service is in a state of almost permanent crisis.  Too many of us experience a second-class system. People are waiting too long to be treated; they are suffering shabby and unhygenic conditions in hospitals; they have no choice in how, when or where they are looked after. As people become used to choice and quality in other areas of their life, the service they get from the NHS is increasingly unacceptable.  It's not just about money.  Ask anyone who works in the health service and they will tell you that the NHS is now creaking under the strain of bureaucracy and Government gimmicks. All the Government has done in four years is to substitute its own political priorities and the pursuit of headlines for the clinical judgment of doctors and nurses. Labour said they would cut waiting lists - so hospitals have been forced to bring in waiting lists to get on the waiting list, and to give priority to non-urgent operations over those in genuine medical need.  It's time for common sense. The next Conservative Government will match the Government's plans for spending on the NHS but ensure the money goes further.  We will take politicians out of the day-to-day management of the NHS, putting in their place respect for clinical decisions and accountability to patients.  We will also build a new partnership between the state and independent sectors.  The Conservative party is committed to a comprehensive NHS free to all its users.  The Patient's Guarantee  The NHS cannot succeed if those who work within it are not allowed to succeed. Our National Health Service used to be an example to the world. We still have first class doctors and nurses, and many of our hospitals have international reputations for excellence. The clinical judgment of professionals in the NHS is still among the best anywhere.  Yet, immediately on taking office, Labour introduced their Waiting List Initiative which replaced clinical judgment with bogus political priorities.  Immediately on our taking office we will abolish the Waiting List initiative. We will introduce a Patient's Guarantee instead.  The Patient's Guarantee will give patients a maximum waiting time in defined clinical areas, starting with cardiac and cancer services, based on their medical need as assessed by the patient's own consultant. The health authority will be obliged either to treat the patient within that maximum waiting time, or to arrange for the patient to have the choice of being treated in another health authority or in a private hospital.  We will stop politicians interfering in clinical decisions and in the running of hospitals.  The role of the Secretary of State will be to agree funding, and to regulate standards of quality, not to micro-manage hospitals. We will create a properly independent appointments body, and ensure that ministers cannot interfere in its workings, so that people who work in the NHS are chosen because of their expertise, not their politics.  The quality of the care people receive in hospital is determined as much by standards on the ward as by their surgical procedures. Yet while Ward Sisters are held responsible for the well-being of their patients, they do not have authority over many of the activities, such as feeding and cleaning, that determine the quality of the care they provide.  We will require hospitals to give back authority to Ward Sisters, so that they can make sure that their patients get  the care they demand. And we want to bring back Matron so that someone is responsible for overseeing and supporting the nursing staff.  Choice for GPs and patients  One of the best ways of improving the performance of the NHS is to give patients choice.  When Labour were elected they limited GPs'freedom to refer patients to the hospital of their choice.  We will give back to patients and their doctors the power to choose.  Patients will be able to be treated in the hospital which they and their GPs choose, and will have full access to information on hospitals'waiting lists and success rates to enable them to make that choice.  Hospitals will be rewarded for the operations they carry out, so that good hospitals can attract more patients and more funding, and patients will be able to choose to be treated in hospitals with world-class expertise in their illness.  We will allow alternative and complementary therapies to be made available through the NHS, provided they are of proven clinical effectiveness.  We will give doctors the right to decide how they organise themselves to deliver the best care to their patients.  GPs have told us that they don't want a new upheaval in primary care: we will follow their advice. Instead, we will give GPs the choice of whether to operate as Primary Care Trusts if they think that is right for themselves and their patients. And we will encourage GPs to specialise, so that GP teams will be increasingly able to offer expert diagnosis and treatment to their patients. That way, many patients will get expert opinions and care by doctors they know, without the need to go to hospital.  Choice for patients extends to private healthcare.  Because of the problems in the health service many people with modest incomes spend their hard-earned savings on paying privately for operations or for medical insurance for themselves and their families. In doing so, they free resources in the NHS and help reduce waiting times, but often at considerable personal cost.  The Conservative Party is committed to a comprehensive NHS free to all its users. There is no question of anyone being forced to take out private insurance. But if people do choose to insure themselves privately they should not be penalised for making this choice.  Labour imposes a tax penalty on employers who offer their employees private medical insurance, and then taxes again any employee who has this benefit. It doesn't make sense and, when affordable, we will abolish both taxes.  We will stop politicians from interfering in clinical decisions and in the running of hospitals.  We will ensure hospices are properly funded by increasing the states contribution from 32% to 40% for adult hospices and from 4% to 40% for children s hospices.  More patients treated, more quickly  Conservatives will unblock the bottlenecks that slow down treatment in the NHS.  We will, for example, encourage the development of stand-alone surgical units specialising in a particular type  of standard operation, such as cataract surgery or hip replacements. These units would be funded by the NHS  and be free of charge for patients, but could be operated by either NHS or private providers. They would enable us  to make rapid reductions in the waiting times required for these procedures.  It doesn't take a doctor to take a patient's blood pressure. We will encourage an expansion in the role of practice  nurses to take on some of the tasks carried out by GPs, allowing them more time to see more patients.  Some health authorities allow doctors to prescribe certain new drugs, and some do not. Conservatives will end this lottery whereby the postcode you live in determines the treatment you receive by introducing an Exceptional Medicines Fund. Expensive new medicines - such as Beta Interferon for multiple sclerosis - will be funded direct to doctors from a budget set by the Secretary of State. Access to the funding will be decided by criteria laid down by a panel of senior clinicians and academics.  Conservatives will ensure that important issues of medical ethics are properly debated in Parliament.  through our lives  growing older  Common sense means respect and independence for older people  * Cut taxes for pensioners  * Increase the basic state pension  * Abolish compulsory annuities at age 75  * Allow younger workers to opt for properly funded private pensions  * Protect the savings and homes of those needing long term care  Older people are among our most responsible citizens and give a great deal to their communities, but they have been demeaned and patronised by this Government. They resent being seen as a burden. And they fear they do not have a place in Blair's Cool Britannia.  To be able to have the standard of living to which they are entitled, Britain's pensioners now have to apply to the Statefor special favours. When Labour came into office, 37 per cent of pensioners had to take the means test in order to get their benefit entitlement. On Labour's current plans, within two years most pensioners - 57 per cent - will have to apply to the State for help in this undignified and intrusive way.  Pensioners are proud of being able to take responsibility for themselves, but Labour has denied them this dignity. Instead they have taxed pensioners more heavily and driven them on to means-tested benefits.  It's time for common sense.  Conservatives will give pensioners greater independence from the State, by cutting taxes, removing a million pensioners from income tax altogether, and by increasing the basic state pension - with no strings attached.  We will abolish the rule which currently forces pensioners to buy an annuity when they reach 75.  Freeing pensioners from tax  It is wrong that pensioners with modest incomes find themselves paying income tax. It is particularly unfair that pensioners who have saved for their retirement - from their salaries on which they have already paid tax - are then taxed again on the interest their savings earn. We will abolish taxes on savings for most savers - which will be of particular benefit to pensioners.  A Conservative Government will also raise the special age tax allowance for pensioners by £2,000, from around £6,000 to over £8,000 per year. This will take one million pensioners out of income tax altogether and many other pensioners will pay £8.50 less tax per week.  A higher pension  Conservatives want to provide support to pensioners when they need it most. This should not entail more and more pensioners facing the indignity and bureaucracy of means tests.  So we will offer pensioners a substantial increase in the basic state pension.  At our first opportunity to uprate pensions, in April 2002, we will match the Government's plans for an increase of £3 a week for a single pensioner under 75 and £4.80 for a married couple under 75.  But we will go further in helping older pensioners, who tend to be poorer. Over-75s will have a bigger uprating of £4 for a single pensioner and £6.80 for a married couple. We will be helping poorer pensioners without more means-testing.  Pensioners can carry on receiving the free TV licence, the Winter Fuel Payment, and the Christmas bonus exactly as at present. But, if they prefer it, we will give every pensioner the choice to opt for a higher basic pension, which consolidates these individual payments, tax-free.  This option will be available to all pensioners who get their pension uprated, including groups that Labour forgot - the 200,000 in nursing homes and residential accommodation who do not receive the winter fuel payment and 360,000 pensioners living abroad.  Funded pensions  The best way to make sure that people have decent incomes in their retirement is for them to invest during their lives in assets that will grow. But the state takes people's national insurance contributions and then fails to invest them, leaving pensioners with miserly pensions.  We need to make it easier for people to provide for a prosperous retirement.  But Labour have hit private and occupational pensions with higher taxes. And many of the current generation of working people have expectations of the pension they are likely to receive which are unfortunately way ahead of the likely reality.  The best way to achieve higher pensions in the future is by more genuine funding of pensions. We wish to enable young people to build up a funded alternative to the basic pension for the future. No-one would be forced to change. The basic state pension would continue to be paid as now, not merely to current pensioners but to people of working age and new entrants who want it in the future. We will consult on how best to offer this new option of funded pensions for young people.  We will also abolish the rule which currently forces pensioners to buy an annuity when they reach 75.  People with personal pensions will only need to ensure that they have sufficient income to keep free of means-tested benefits.  The remaining capital in the pension fund will be theirs to keep and - if they wish - to pass on to their children.  We will abolish taxes on savings for most savers - which will be of particular benefit to pensioners  Long term care  We also want to tackle another problem which preys on the minds of many people as they become older - meeting the costs of long-term care. Our proposed funding of the NHS matches Labour's plans and includes a commitment that all nursing care will be free at the point of use. But we need to go further to get at the source of the problem.  We will consider how people who have made prudent provision in advance for the cost of long term care can be protected from having their assets taken by the state if their actual care costs are more than could reasonably be foreseen.  Your pension with the Conservatives  Basic state pension  2001/02  Basic state pension 2002/03  (Conservative plans)  Value of pension  with optional consolidated  special payments  Single pensioner  £72.50  £75.50  £78.60  Married pensioner couple  £115.90  £120.70  £124.00  Single pensioner over 75  £72.50  £76.50  £81.75  Married couple over 75  £115.90  £122.70  £128.20  knowing who we are  a world leader  Common sense means valuing what makes us distinctive as a nation  * A more flexible European Union  * Veto further transfers of power from Westminster to Brussels  * No European army outside NATO  * Global free trade by 2020  * A safe haven, not a soft touch, on asylum  Britain is one of the world's most respected democracies, one of its most influential leaders, one of its most  prosperous nations and one of its greatest military powers.  Our possession of all of these qualities, which we rightly value, depends upon our ability to govern ourselves. And all of them are put at risk by the threat that is now posed to our independence.  Labour have lost confidence in our ability to govern ourselves.  It's time for common sense.  The next Conservative Government will secure our independence and use Britain's great strengths to help create  a flexible Europe of nations, to maintain the Atlantic Alliance and to develop the role of the Commonwealth.  The next Conservative Government will keep the pound. We will maintain our national veto on European legislation.  In Europe, not run by Europe  The guiding principle of Conservative policy towards the European Union is to be in Europe, but not run by Europe.  We will lead a debate in Europe about its future, promoting our own clear and positive vision.  The European Union has, with the prospect of enlargement, reached a fork in the road. Down one route lies a fully integrated superstate with nation states and the national veto disappearing. The Government is taking us down this route.  The alternative is a Europe of nations coming together in different combinations for different purposes and to differing extents. In other words, a network Europe. If Britain leads the debate, we can make this alternative a reality.  We will insist on a Treaty 'flexibility' provision, so that outside the areas of the single market and core elements of an open, free-trading and competitive EU, countries need only participate in new legislative actions at a European level if they see this as in their national interest.  At the same time, we are willing to support the principle of 'reinforced co-operation' in Europe, under which small groups of countries can become more closely integrated if they wish to do so, providing it does not damage Britain's national interest.  The next Conservative Government will keep the pound. We will maintain our national veto on European legislation. Giving up either would put our ability to govern ourselves at risk. We will not ratify the Nice Treaty but will renegotiate it so that Britain does not lose its veto.  We also propose to amend our domestic law to include 'reserved powers'. This will prevent EU law from overriding the will of Parliament in areas which Parliament never intended to transfer to the EU.  This policy will be reinforced with a determination to veto further transfers of power from Westminster to Brussels. Should any future Government wish to surrender any more of Parliament's rights and power to Brussels they should be required to secure approval for such a transfer in a referendum.  We intend to press for the single market to be completed and for competition laws to be stronger so that British businesses which play by the rules are not undercut by other companies that do not.  We will also press for Europe to tackle fraud and maladministration as a matter of priority. If the EU reduced waste and abandoned ill-considered programmes, it could make significant reductions in the overall size of the European budget.  A military power and a staunch ally  One of the reasons that Britain is respected around the world is that it remains a first-class military power.  The British way of life and freedom and democracy around the world are made more secure by the professionalism of our armed forces and the success of our long term military alliances.  Yet now all this is under threat.  The last four years have seen our armed forces come under increased pressure. Overstretched and undermanned, they have also come under attack from those more interested in political correctness than operational effectiveness. At the same time, our primary alliance, NATO, is being weakened by a concerted drive to create an independent military structure in the EU. And for the first time, a British government is leading this attempt.  A Conservative Government would pursue a very different policy.  We think it is common sense to support institutions that work. Our armed forces and NATO work very well.  So we will support our armed forces by setting out to match commitments to capabilities, by making it a priority to achieve the armed forces' full manning levels and by opposing political correctness. We will exempt the armed forces from the European Convention on Human Rights, just as France, Spain, Portugal and others have done.  We will seek greater flexibility to deal with unplanned commitments and to reduce overstretch. We will reform the Territorial Army and enhance the role of the Royal Auxiliary Air Force and our other Reserve Forces.  Conservatives have always supported stronger European defence co-operation, but always inside NATO. We will not participate in a structure outside NATO, but will insist instead that any European initiative is under the NATO umbrella.  We will also end this Government's equivocation over the development by the US of ballistic missile defences. We believe our close ally deserves our support in countering new threats from rogue states and terrorists equipped with weapons of mass destruction. We will take a lead in building support for ballistic missile defence against threats to Europe and America.  We remain fully committed to Britain's independent nuclear deterrent.  Coming to the aid of others  Playing our part in world leadership means playing our part in helping the development of other countries.  We will work towards the UN aid target of 0.7% of GNP.  We will do what we can to encourage responsible behaviour by aid recipients, by focusing on good governance, and by strengthening civil society, free markets, the rule of law and anti-corruption measures.  We will increase the involvement of charities and the voluntary sector. We will double the proportion of our aid budget spent through aid charities, as they are often better placed than governments to relieve suffering. We will also establish a central information service, 'Aid Direct', that will build strong direct links between aid donors and recipients.  Multilateral aid and development institutions are crying out for reform. In particular, we are calling for the EU to set its house in order. Unless the Commission reforms its management, we will propose a treaty amendment allowing member states to deliver aid bilaterally instead.  We will press for more effective debt relief, action on HIV/AIDS and conflict prevention and resolution.  We will appoint an Envoy for Religious Freedom.  We want early enlargement of the European Union - the first wave, including Cyprus, should be admitted by 2004.  Taking a lead in the world  The world is changing. The old power blocs are declining in importance. Nations, and networks between nations, are taking centre stage.  Conservatives will build on Britain's strengths, so Britain can be a force for good. Britain has prospered when trade has been free. We will lead the campaign for a trans-Atlantic free trade area, encompassing the EU and NAFTA. This is a step towards our vision of global free trade by 2020. Britain has an unrivalled diplomatic service. We will strengthen it further by creating a new Foreign, Commonwealth and Trade Office to bring diplomacy and free trade together, giving renewed impetus to trade and commerce.  The Commonwealth has huge potential - as a force for stability, for promoting the rule of law, democracy and the  open economy, and potentially as a means of focusing UK aid. We will consult with our partners on implementing many of the recommendations of the Commonwealth Commission.  We will use Britain's influence in the world for peace and stability, whether in Kashmir or Cyprus or the Middle East.  Britain has vast global reach. In a world where geography matters less, Britain is not on the periphery of anything. Uniquely, we have a central place in the EU, NATO, the Commonwealth and the UN. A Conservative government  will be outward-looking, using our influence to the full.  A safe haven, not a soft touch, on asylum  Over the centuries Britain has welcomed people who have been persecuted by oppressive regimes overseas.  But now our ability to be a safe haven for the genuinely oppressed is severely hampered by the virtual collapse of our asylum system. This chaos encourages unfounded asylum claims.  Britain has gained a reputation as a soft touch for bogus asylum seekers.  This Government has allowed a crisis to develop which has encouraged an illegal trade in human misery, blighting many lives.  The problem here is worse than anywhere else in Europe because of Labour's mismanagement. The Government has presided over massive delays in processing applications and admits that thousands of those whose cases are rejected simply disappear and never leave.  In four years, Labour has seen the cost of the asylum system double and put a great strain on many communities.  Our policy will be that all new asylum applicants are housed in secure reception centres until their cases are determined. This will speed up the process of establishing which claims are well-founded. Asylum applications from safe countries will not normally be accepted.  We will ensure that those whose claims are rejected are quickly deported by a new Removals Agency.  Conservatives will restore common sense to Britain's asylum procedures.  knowing who we are  a stronger society  Common sense means responsible citizens  and a smaller state  * Create an Office of Civil Society to champion families, voluntary organisations and faith communities  * Reform taxation for charities  * Pay independent groups to get people back to work and find them lasting jobs  * Protect the savings of disabled people and help them find work  * Tackle welfare fraud  A strong society rests on responsible individuals and families. They need to be able to turn to straightforward, reliable  help when times are bad. But that should not become dependence on the state when times are good.  Labour promised to reform the welfare state, but they shirked the challenge.  It's time for common sense.  The next Conservative Government will help build a stronger society. We will provide support for individuals and families when they need it. And we will encourage people to take responsibility for themselves and their families.  Tolerance is one of Britain's historic virtues. A strong society is built on respect for all people - whatever their race, religion, gender or sexual orientation.  Welfare without the state  Many of our poorest people are forced to struggle with a mess of complicated and ill thought out government schemes. And at the same time, the Government is squeezing out genuine voluntary groups, who are best able to help people in real need.  Conservative policy will be very different.  A Conservative Government will tackle the problems of poverty and disadvantage with the same vigour and inventiveness with which we tackle Britain's economic problems. Central government will not try to do everything by itself. Instead we will work with volunteers, charities and local institutions to bring new life to our communities.  We will establish a new Office of Civil Society to give families, faith communities and voluntary groups a voice at the heart of Government. The Office will cut through the bureaucracy that stops the good neighbours of Britain from helping those in need.  We hope to help charities by abolishing their irrecoverable VAT liabilities. The Government refuses to be frank about the money that Whitehall departments have set aside for preparations for converting to the euro, but we believe they are substantial. We will divert this money to fund this major reform of taxation for charities.  Effective help for unemployed people  It is a cruel trick on unemployed people to place them on training schemes which often do little or nothing to improve their long-term employment prospects.  Labour's New Deal raised people's hopes but has failed to deliver. Unemployment has fallen more slowly under this Government than under the last one.  The next Conservative Government will help unemployed people back into work more effectively than ever before.  We will replace the New Deal with 'Britain Works'. Independent contractors will be rewarded not just for their success in helping the unemployed to find jobs but also for enabling them to keep those jobs.  This will address one of the worst failures of this Government's employment policies - the revolving door which takes people through a cycle of benefits, training schemes, and temporary work, only to end up back on benefits.  The best way of helping unemployed people is to get them back into work as quickly as possible. That is the basis of our Can Work, Must Work Guarantee. Those who can work must do so or they will lose their unemployment benefits.  Helping people into the labour market  There is evidence that it is in the best interests of children of a lone parent for that parent to be working when the child is of secondary school age. It increases the chances that the child will get good qualifications and go on successfully to hold down a job.  We will therefore expect lone parents on income support with children over 11 to be actively seeking the sort of jobs which they can combine with their family responsibilities.  Labour have treated people with disabilities appallingly - means-testing their benefits and eroding their supported employment. It is time for them to have a better deal.  The Government is treating the savings of disabled people on Income Support less generously than pensioners in the same circumstances. This is an indefensible and unprecedented discrimination against disabled people. We will tackle it head-on. We will increase the amount of savings which a disabled person can have before losing benefit, matching the entitlement of pensioners.  Disabled people who have lost their jobs can become trapped on Incapacity Benefit.  We will address this problem by creating a new agency which will pay Incapacity Benefit on the basis of current entitlements.  But it will also have the funds to obtain the physiotherapy or the physical aids which can help disabled people back to work as quickly as possible.  Britain is made up of many ethnic communities. Conservatives believe that we are richer and stronger for it.  An effective attack on fraud  Instead of reforming welfare, Labour have made it even more complex. Instead of encouraging self-reliance they have spread dependence on means tests. Complicated means-tested benefits are not just demeaning, they are also wide open to fraud and abuse. The Government itself has admitted that there could be £7 billion of fraud. In 1998/99 there were 160,000 established cases of Housing Benefit and Council Tax benefit fraud, but just 800 successful prosecutions - 99.5% of fraudsters are not successfully prosecuted. We will introduce a tough anti-fraud package, including a single integrated task force to tackle fraud nationwide. There are 80 million National Insurance numbers which is rather more than the entire UK population. Some of these numbers are fraudulent and we will clean them up.  knowing who we are  town and country  Common sense means valuing the distinctiveness of both town and country  * Implement a Strategy for Recovery from Foot and Mouth for farms and rural businesses  * Establish Regeneration Companies to revitalise inner cities and housing estates  * Abolish housebuilding targets which threaten our green fields  * Cut business rates for rural shops, pubs, garages and village post offices  * Cut fuel tax to help motorists  Local communities are life's essential harbours. They provide us with a strong sense of local identity. But too many are under enormous pressure. Our countryside, ignored by the Government, has been devastated by the Foot and Mouth crisis. There are too many urban and rural communities that are not sharing in our country's prosperity and where deprivation passes from generation to generation. There are other neighbourhoods where many young people cannot afford to live, despite having grown up there.  It's time for common sense.  Conservatives will restore to communities a sense that they can shape their neighbourhoods, influence local architecture and improve the quality of their surroundings. And we will take effective action to help our rural communities and businesses recover from the effects of Foot and Mouth.  Farming and the countryside are in crisis. Foot and Mouth disease is but the latest in a series of blows inflicted on our farmers.  Recovering from Foot and Mouth  The Foot and Mouth crisis has been a disaster for our countryside. Farmers have seen years of hard work destroyed in weeks. Rural businesses have seen their turnover collapse. Animals have suffered welfare problems of a kind we never expected to see in Britain. The tragedy is that the crisis need not have been as widespread or so prolonged if the Government had acted urgently and decisively from the beginning.  The priority now must to be help the countryside recover. Immediately upon taking office, we will implement our Strategy for Recovery - practical steps to stamp out Foot and Mouth once and for all; help for struggling tourism and other rural business and firm action to prevent infection entering Britain again.  Farming and the countryside  Foot and Mouth disease is but the latest in a series of blows inflicted on our farmers.  The Common Agricultural Policy has damaged consumers, farmers, the taxpayer and the environment. It must be reformed to cut the bill for taxpayers and consumers, provide sustainable long term support for farming, and protect the environment and the countryside. We will renegotiate the CAP so that many decisions currently taken at EU level would be taken by the governments of individual member states.  Farmers and other rural businesses spend too much time on form-filling and red tape. The next Conservative Government will not enforce European regulations any sooner or more zealously than other countries.  We will also fight for a fair deal for consumers, by introducing honesty in labelling and requiring the country of origin and method of production of the main ingredients to be stated on the label of all food products.  We will also renegotiate the Common Fisheries Policy. We will insist on national or local controls being established over our own waters, whether through zonal management, or coastal management, or in some other way.  We will improve animal protection and welfare by building on the successes of the last Conservative Government to raise animal welfare standards in Europe.  The Foot and Mouth crisis has not only badly damaged farming but has also damaged the general rural economy and all that depends on it. Alongside the farming crisis, rural communities are losing their post offices, pubs and police stations at alarming rates.  Labour neither understands the needs of the countryside nor even cares about its survival.  We need a new approach.  The next Conservative government will protect the liberty and livelihood of rural communities. Our policies on transport, crime, planning and Europe will all benefit the countryside.  We will cut business rates for rural shops, pubs, garages and village post offices and change the rules so that they can provide new, much-needed local services. We will encourage more passenger-friendly rural transport services and give community transport schemes a tax rebate on their fuel cost.  Post offices round the country are closing in record numbers because the Government has announced the ending of cash payment of pensions and benefits at post offices. We recognise the essential part played by post offices as a focus of community life.  We will remove Labour's threat and instead introduce a benefit card which will cut fraud and bring large efficiency gains while continuing to bring business into post offices.  We will abolish centrally-driven national or regional housebuilding targets. Local councils accountable to local people should be responsible for meeting local housing needs. Where there is rapid population growth, central government should work in partnership with local councils to invest in additional infrastructure.  As well as our Green Belts, we will take action to protect our rivers, wetlands, lakes, canals and coastline from development by establishing ""Blue Belt"" areas.  The Conservatives will establish a new Select Committee on Rural Affairs to monitor the impact on rural communities of all aspects of government policy.  The regeneration of urban Britain  The future of the countryside is bound up with the future of our inner cities. As long as people leave the cities to occupy new houses built on green fields there can be no prospect of an urban revival.  We must start by making our cities places where families want to live and put down roots. That means tackling the problems that drive many familes to leave. First and foremost this means education and crime. In too many of our inner cities families with young children feel they have to get out to get educated. And until there is effective policing and the streets are safe, money spent improving houses or encouraging enterprise will have little impact.  The next Conservative Government will establish new local Regeneration Companies to drive the campaign to revitalise our inner cities and outer urban estates.  Working with local councils, businesses and people they will be able to buy extra policing strength, help set up Partner Schools, and tear down the worst tower blocks. They will have statutory powers to accelerate the planning and development of rundown areas.  We will support radical solutions to the long term decline of coastal towns - bringing in new measures to help them support and market their heritage, protect their coastline, improve transport links, and tackle the problems they face in housing asylum-seekers.  We will also tackle the problem of 'neighbours from hell'. We will enable the eviction of residents who break tenancy agreements, fail to pay their rent and desecrate the neighbourhood. We will tackle the problems which undermine the quality of life in these areas such as litter, graffiti, and dumped cars. We will also tackle insensitive siting of mobile phone masts without adequate consultation.  We will streamline planning procedures to make it easier for new houses to be built on brownfield sites. We will give local councils power to declare extra areas of local Green Belt.  And we will make Britain a nation of homeowners. We will increase the right-to-buy discounts on council homes and introduce a new rent-to-mortgage scheme. Homesteading grants will allow people to first repair, and then own empty council housing.  Conservatives will give housing associations more freedom to compete in the housing market. We will encourage greater involvement of tenants in running their estates.  Foot and Mouth: A Strategy for Recovery  Conservatives have played a constructive role throughout the Foot and Mouth crisis.We have put forward practical policies to speed up the eradication of the disease,give real help to businesses hit by the crisis and to ease the suffering of animals.  Immediately upon taking office we will implement a Strategy for Recovery including action to:  *  speed up disposal of slaughtered animals  * unblock delays in compensation for affected farms  * offer interest-free loans for affected businesses  * properly fund campaigns to promote the tourist industry  * block high risk food imports to prevent Foot and Mouth recurring  Transport  Labour promised 'immediate benefits'in transport. But public transport has become worse, while our roads are more  congested than ever. Britain has the highest road user taxes in Europe and the worst traffic jams. Labour want to force car drivers off the roads, without offering an alternative. They will tax drivers who come into town centres, and tax those who need to park at work.  Last year, Labour took £36 billion from road users but they spent less than £8 billion on transport. Conservatives are not anti-car, but we are anti-pollution, and so we will cut taxes on cleaner fuels and cleaner vehicles.  We will set out long term investment plans for roads and public transport, meeting the needs of commuters, cyclists, pedestrians, and elderly and disabled people. We will establish a new Roads Standards Unit to champion the interests of road users. It will aim to take through traffic out of towns and villages and minimise the environmental effects of roads. It will set sensible speed limits for each stretch of road, and make roads safer.  Unlike Labour, we will not ban people from driving if they marginally exceed the 70mph limit on motorways. Instead we will look to improve the traffic flow on motorways by increasing the speed limit to 80 mph where it is safe to do so, and enforcing this speed limit rigorously. We will target the hard core of bad drivers who are the main cause of accidents.  We will restore the competitiveness of the British haulage, shipping, and aviation industries. We will charge foreign lorries for the use of British roads with our Brit Disc scheme.  We will cut tax on petrol and diesel by 6p per litre. It is technology, not taxation, that cuts pollution from vehicles.  We will revive the railway industry so it achieves airline standards of service and safety. We will stop Labour's policy of blame and shame. We will implement the Cullen Inquiry recommendations. Subject to a 'no strike' deal we will work with Bob Kiley - who transformed the New York subway - and support his ambitions to create a world class London Underground.  The wider environment  Conservatives believe that each of us should act as a steward preserving and enhancing the natural world and the built environment for future generations.  The biggest global environmental challenge is to prevent climate change causing long-term damage through extreme weather conditions. We will meet the commitments made by successive British governments by a comprehensive package of emission permit trading, energy conservation measures, tax incentives, greater encouragement of renewable energy and cleaner energy generation.  knowing who we are  a civilised country  Common sense means supporting the people that create a thriving culture  * Free arts organisations from dependence on the state by giving them endowments  * Back the tourism industry  * Privatise the commercially successful Channel Four  * Simplify regulation of British broadcasting and communications  * Support youth, grass roots and elite sport  Government policy towards the arts, sports and broadcasting has stumbled from fiasco to disaster in the last four years.  The Government wasted millions of pounds on bailing out the Dome, botched the development of Wembley stadium, dithered over the new UK Sports Institute, and supervised a bizarre competition to run the National Lottery only to end up handing it back to the existing firm.  This incompetence has been accompanied by a disdain for British traditions and a modish contempt for our heritage. Labour even promoted a bogus new culture - 'Cool Britannia'- in an attempt to supplant the culture and identity which has shaped us.  It's time for common sense.  A Conservative Government will be optimistic about Britain's future because we are comfortable with Britain's past.  Tony Blair said that the Dome would be a vivid symbol of Labours Britain. That is exactly what it was. Step inside and you could be anywhere - it was banal, anonymous and rootless. It lacked a sense of Britains history or culture.  Freeing our culture from political interference  The last Conservative Government transformed the funding of sport, the arts and our historic environment by creating the National Lottery. We ensured that money from this source was additional to Government spending, and administered independently.  Labour have increasingly taken control of Lottery funds. The rules which govern applications for Lottery funds are excessively complex. We will reform them, so that they are more accessible to small community groups.  We will set about freeing the arts from Government interference.  Using the proceeds from the sale of Channel 4 and undistributed surpluses from the Lottery, we will create a £3 billion endowment fund for cultural organisations.  This will dramatically extend freedom from State dependency and political control.  Conservatives recognise the role of the arts in developing the creative skills which are essential to Britain's future prosperity.  We will undertake a radical review of the Arts Council of England and the Regional Arts Boards. We want to create a less bureaucratic funding structure which delivers more for the arts and for artists.  Britain's £65 billion tourist industry is a powerful force for urban and rural regeneration. Under Labour, Britain's trade deficit in tourism has doubled, and tourist businesses have been hit by a tide of new regulations. We will back Britain around the world by increasing support for the British Tourist Authority and restoring a voice for English Tourism. This will be all the more important in the light of the disastrous impact of Foot and Mouth disease on the whole sector.  Championing sport  The success of our athletes in the Sydney Olympics showed how important sport can be in creating a sense of national pride. The dedication and skill of our Olympic team was supported by funds from the National Lottery, established by the last Conservative Government. We will ensure that our elite athletes get the funding they need to achieve excellence in the future.  But our future success is threatened because too few young people get the chance to take part in sport at school.  Conservatives will give back to headteachers and governors the right to offer adequate time for sport. We will also give further protection to playing fields.  We will reform the law to enable local voluntary sports clubs to apply for charitable status, strengthening their financial base and encouraging private investment in grassroots sport, and helping to safeguard their assets for future generations.  We will look to streamline the over-complex funding structures for sport, reducing the number of quangoes and devolving more funds to a more rationalised network of governing bodies.  Conservatives recognise the role of the arts in developing the creative skills which are essential to Britains future prosperity.  Freeing the media and communications industries  Our best media companies lead the world in quality and innovation.  Conservatives deregulated the telecommunications market and Britain was well placed to benefit from the convergence of media and communications technologies.  But we are throwing away our head start. Labour have stalled over liberalising telecommunications. The numerous overlapping regulatory authorities in the communications industries urgently need rationalising.  The next Conservative Government will make Britain once again a beacon of competition in the communications industries.  We will privatise Channel 4, while maintaining its public service remit. The State has no business owning a commercial TV company.  We will introduce early legislation to create a single regulator for the media and communications industries charged with speeding up the introduction of competition. We will liberate media companies from outdated ownership rules and ensure that regulation is minimised, while protecting the vulnerable from offensive material.  Our policy will deliver fair and independent regulation of the BBC. The regulator will require the BBC to make the most of its assets for the benefit of the licence fee payer but to rein in any expansion plans which are hostile to competition.  We will ensure that religious broadcasters have fair and equal access to future competitions for local, national, digital and programme service licences.  knowing who we are  a proud democracy  Common sense means fewer politicians and more local decision-making  * Transfer power from central government to effective local councils  * Local referendums before large increases in Council Tax  * Abolish artificial regional tiers of administration in England  * Reform Parliament so that only English and Welsh MPs vote on exclusively English and Welsh matters  * Strengthen parliamentary scrutiny of the Government  Britain's democracy has always been one of our greatest strengths. It has made our country what it is, and has embodied and defended our freedoms.  But after four years of Labour, the way we govern ourselves has been abused. We have an arrogant and complacent Government which ignores Parliament and people. We have the anomaly of MPs from Scotland and Northern Ireland voting on laws that apply only to England and Wales. The House of Lords, historically a source of balance and independence, has suffered a botched reform.  People identify with their local communities. But under this Government they are being marginalised by alien new regional bureaucracies that are costly, unaccountable and unnecessary.  Our constitution is being perverted, and faith in politics and politicians is at an all time low.  It's time for common sense.  A Conservative Government will revitalise our democracy by giving more power to local people, and once more placing Parliament at the centre of our national life.  Revitalising local government  People feel at home in their local communities, be they counties, towns, villages or parishes.  But real communities are being weakened by too much government from Whitehall, and by the imposition of artificial new layers of government with which people don't identify. The next Conservative Government will revolutionise the attitude of central government to local government.  The best councils offer excellent value for money and serve their communities well. Conservatives believe that councils that have such a track record of success should be trusted with more power. They will be able to become 'free councils'. We will devolve financial and administrative power from central government to them, and establish a stronger link between the money they raise and the money they spend.  We believe that local citizens should decide how much their council will spend. The next Conservative Government will not use its powers to cap local council budgets.  We will abolish many of the national targets and plans that local councils are forced to follow by Whitehall.  Alongside this policy of granting greater freedom to the best councils must come some protection from abuses by the worst. So we will look at ways in which local councils proposing increases in their budgets significantly above the rate of inflation can be obliged to hold a local referendum on the increase in the Council Tax which this would entail. We will also retain Section 28 of the Local Government Act.  Labour have introduced a new tier of regional bureaucracy. But almost no-one identifies with the arbitrary regions into which the country has been carved up - they owe nothing to where people feel they actually belong.  We will abolish the Regional Development Agencies that the Government has introduced and scrap Labour's plans for new Regional Assemblies. We will give responsibility for enterprise and development back to county councils, and to unitary authorities where appropriate, and save the £70 million a year that the RDAs are spending in administration.  Restoring balance in the constitution  Britain's constitution has never been set in stone, but has evolved and adapted to cope with the changing circumstances of different centuries. Because Labour do not understand how the history and stability of our democratic structures have underpinned our national life, they have altered them in a crude, unthinking way, often for narrow party advantage.  As Conservatives have demonstrated in our constructive participation in the Scottish Parliament and Welsh Assembly, we will work to ensure devolution is a success.  But we will restore balance to our vandalised democracy.  When Parliament is discussing something that affects the whole of the United Kingdom, all MPs should vote. But only English and Welsh MPs will be entitled to vote on Government Bills relating to England and Wales. And English MPs alone will vote on the remaining laws which apply exclusively to England.  In changing the way Parliament works our overriding objective will be to strengthen the ability of the House of Lords and the House of Commons to hold the Government to account. We will strengthen the independence of the House of Lords as an effective revising chamber by requiring new members to be approved by an independent appointments commission. We will set up a Joint Committee of both Houses of Parliament in order to seek consensus on lasting reform in the House of Lords. We would like to see a stronger House of Lords in the future, including a substantial elected element.  Conservatives will support reforms of the House of Commons to make ministers more accountable. As a first step we will once again require the Prime Minister to appear before the House of Commons twice a week, and make sure that Select Committees are independent of party managers.  We reaffirm our commitment to keeping Britain's voting system for general elections.  Northern Ireland  As a Unionist party, we value the contribution that Northern Ireland makes to the United Kingdom. Conservatives have always upheld the principle that the future of Northern Ireland will be determined solely by democracy and consent and never by violence. The next Conservative Government will resolutely maintain Northern Ireland's position within the United Kingdom, in accordance with the democratically expressed wishes of the greater number of its people.  Conservatives continue to believe that the Belfast Agreement offers the best chance for lasting peace and political stability. The key to progress is maintaining confidence on all sides. So the next Conservative Government will work tirelessly and constructively to bring about the full implementation of all aspects of the Agreement, including the decommissioning of illegally-held terrorist arms and explosives.  We remain unstinting in our praise for the work of the Royal Ulster Constabulary and the armed forces in fighting terrorism. Improvements to the overall security situation will inevitably bring about changes, but reductions in security will only be made on the basis of the prevailing terrorist threat. Conservatives will not countenance any measure that weakens the ability of the police and army to uphold the rule of law and protect the people of Northern Ireland against terrorism.  Restoring faith in politics  At a time when the Government has interfered as never before in everyone's lives, they have abandoned any pretence of accountability. No wonder the British people have become disillusioned with politicians.  We want to return to people responsibility for their lives by reducing the level of political interference and regulation. And that involves reducing the number of politicians.  We will abandon the Government's plans for a new tier of regional politicians in England. We will cut the number of government ministers and, once we have strengthened parliamentary scrutiny, we will reduce the size of the House of Commons.  And we will cut the number of political advisers and spin doctors employed, at the taxpayer's expense, to serve government ministers.  time to deliver  Conservatives have a vision of what our country can be when it is true to its own character.  We want strong families and enterprising business. We want a free and responsible society. We want to govern ourselves, confident in a stable and trusted constitution. This manifesto sets out the vision that will inspire the next Conservative Government.  It's time for a Government that will deliver.  It's time to support marriage and the family; time for a war on crime; time to cut taxes and regulation; time for our schools and hospitals to benefit from choice and freedom; time to show respect to our pensioners; time for real savings not welfare dependency; time to endow our universities; time to rebuild our inner cities; time to end the crisis in the countryside; time to be in Europe, but not run by it.  It's time for common sense.  For partially-sighted and blind people a special audio version will be produced. A large print edition will also be available.

"SNP",200106,"Heart of the Manifesto 2001 Our Platform We stand for Scotland The SNP stands for Scotland. We stand for Independence and we stand for the people -all the people - who live in our rich country. At the Westminster election the people of Scotland have a choice. A choice between the Scottish National Party that stands for Scotland and which campaigns for Independence or the London parties which have failed our country for too long. A vote for Scotland The election of SNP MPs to the Westminster Parliament is a vote for Scotland and a vote for Independence. A vote for MPs committed to win Independence, and who will work to bring about Independence as quickly as possible. It is also a vote to win more powers for the Scottish Parliament and a vote for MPs who will always put Scotland first. The more SNP MPs elected to Westminster, the stronger the case for a referendum on Independence. A majority of SNP MPs will trigger a referendum. This means our country gets the chance to vote for Independence - to complete the powers of our Parliament - in a democratic referendum. In advance of that referendum, all SNP MPs will put the case for more and complete powers for the Scottish Parliament from day one in the Westminster Parliament. To be effective the Scottish Parliament must have the ability to take the key decisions that matter to the people of this country. SNP MPs will argue for what is in the Scottish interest at all times and will campaign strongly against all anti-Scottish legislation and measures at Westminster. The SNP has no split loyalty; we work first, last and always for the Scottish interest. Our Contract with the people The more SNP MPs elected to the Westminster Parliament, the more we can do for Scotland. And every vote for the SNP is a vote for the strongest voice for our country. Each and every SNP MP will go to Westminster with three key aims. Drive Scotland forward to Independence, completing the powers of the Scottish  Parliament - The stronger our voice, the stronger we can be in making the case for Independence delivered by a democratic referendum. Deliver the best deal for Scotland - the larger the SNP presence in the House of Commons, the better chance we have of making sure that Scotland gets the best deal. Protect Scotland from the worst failings of Westminster rule - the more SNP MPs, the greater the chance we have of stopping the next fuel tax hike or the next attack on Scottish public spending. Our Independence vision Independence can release the energy, potential and opportunities needed to transform our country and to build a vibrant, exciting future for our children. We have a vision of Scotland that is a just, caring and enterprising country where individuals are able to get on in the world regardless of where they have come from. We believe strongly that there is a modern role for Scotlands democratic government as a keystone in building a modern Scottish society and economy. It is through our government that we can pool our collective resources as a society and focus them on delivering a healthy, well-educated people, living in a 21 st century environment and cared for in times of need. Scotland already has a Parliament but that Parliament has very limited powers. We stand for completing the powers of our Parliament  removing powers over issues that remain in London and bringing them back to Scotland and equipping the Scottish people with the same powers as every other normal country in the world. We stand for giving the people of Scotland the chance to vote for the power to decide where they spend the resources and revenue of Scotland. To decide the amount of investment in public services they want and the amount of benefits they wish to allocate to those in need. All those powers are with London at present and we stand for transferring them to the Scottish Parliament. Government from London will never deliver what we stand for and what the people of Scotland demand. The SNP stands to change that. Scotland has a wealth of potential as a country. We have all the ingredients to make a success of our economy and our society, but we need the confidence in ourselves to make that success happen. Normal status in the world is what Independence is about. We stand for a modern vision to transform Scotland with 21 st Century Independence. Using the wealth of Scotland to work for Scotland Scotland is a wealthy country and can afford to invest more in public services. However, we need to ensure that we can invest in the long term by using the benefits of Scotlands wealth of resources. Scotland will send £7.7 billion to Westminster more than we will receive back over the two years to 2002, as we published in Scotlands 21 st Century Opportunity - Government Expenditures & Revenues in Scotland 2000-2002. We will establish the Scottish Fund for Future Generations (SFFG) as a means of securing that long-term investment. By committing our surplus oil revenues to the SFFG we will lock up the benefits of years of plenty forever. This fund will produce a sustainable stream of income for investment from the depletion of scarce natural resources. The extent of this income will vary with the revenues committed and the rates of return on investment achieved. The investment in the SFFG could be £4.9 billion in the next year alone. The income from that one years investment could in turn be worth in excess of £390 million a year in-perpetuity assuming an 8 per cent benchmark real rate of return. That money would be available for reinvestment in public services on a sustainable basis. The income from the fund is projected to top £1 billion a year after five years and could reach £5 billion per year in time. Norway is already achieving income levels of this order after only five years of operating such a fund. We will also establish the Scottish Trust for Public Investment (STPI). This will target low cost investment into public infrastructure by competing costly PFI/PPP financed projects out of the market. By operating on a not for profit basis, spreading risk and gathering expertise under one roof, together with a secure government income stream, the STPI could cut the cost of capital compared to PFI in half. This will release a massive amount of resources for re-investment into public service infrastructure. Our Policies Constitution The Scottish National Party believes that an Independent Scotland must have a written Constitution that clearly enshrines the rights and responsibilities of all those who choose to live in Scotland. In the context of EU citizenship, the SNP have an open and inclusive approach to Scottish citizenship. The automatic right of citizenship will be open to all those living in Scotland, all those born in Scotland and all those with a parent born in Scotland. All others are free to apply. With Independence, the Queen and her successors will remain as Head of State of Scotland, as defined within the written Constitution, subject to the democratic consent of the people in a referendum. The Scottish National Party supports the introduction of proportional representation at all levels of government. Quangos Public confidence in the quango system is at an all time low. This is exacerbated by the failure of quangos and ministers to be held accountable when they deliver poor performance. We will examine the role and effectiveness of the current range of quangos with a view to abolishing the excessive number of quangos operating in Scotland and to replace the quango state with a democratic state. We will introduce measures to increase the control of the Scottish Parliament over appointments to and performance of those quangos that will remain. In particular, we support the current Private Members Bill in the Scottish Parliament regarding scrutiny of Scotlands quangos. Civil Service Independence will provide job security and new opportunities for civil servants - within the Scottish Executive, Executive Agencies and those UK departments employing staff within Scotland - to advance to the top of their profession. Student Funding The SNP believes in the right of free access to higher education. We support the complete abolition of tuition fees, whether these are due up front or paid back after graduation. As resources allow we will build on existing maintenance grant provision to re-create a decent maintenance grant and remove the dependence on student loans. We are supportive of the additional recommendations of the Cubie Report, in particular those relating to the restoration of state benefits and our Westminster MPs will argue for this. Children & Families The SNP has a long-standing commitment to the reduction of the voting age and would like young people from the age of 16 to have voting entitlement. The SNP would progress towards full implementation of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child. The establishment of a powerful and independent Childrens Commissioner for Scotland is fully supported by the SNP and is essential in promoting awareness of childrens rights and challenging individual breaches of rights. As part of our commitment to family life we will support agencies which offer assistance to couples seeking counselling and help during times of difficulty. Education The SNP wants all Scots to fulfil their potential. We must draw out of each generation the very best that they have to give to their society and to themselves. We must value education for its own sake, but also because enterprise, creativity and ambition all flow from the results of successful and continuing education. The SNP will help Scottish education to become internationally respected once again. We will do that by taking education out of the political battleground and bringing forward proposals to depressurise a system that has been over stressed by central prescription. Our priority policy proposals We would impose a moratorium on further change in the classroom and in educational administration until we have established an Education Convention, chaired by the Education Minister and comprising a wide range of representatives from across Scotland and from throughout education. It will have the responsibility of debating policy proposed by Government prior to the legislative process, and on making recommendations for implementation after it has been approved by Parliament. It will compliment the work of Government and Parliament. The Convention will be established in the first year of an SNP government. Thereafter the SNP will bring forward for pre and post legislative consultation through the Convention three major priority initiatives: We will introduce a phased reduction of Primary 1, 2 and 3 class sizes to 18 or below, initially targeting areas of social deprivation. This will be done by increased investment in teachers, schools and materials. We will end publication of selective information that leads to the compilation of misleading league tables which are increasingly seen as disruptive to the process of learning and which produce no benefit for young people themselves. We will also critically examine the present externally imposed target setting for schools and bring about a reduction in the burden of assessment on young people, Teachers and schools. We will develop a system in which the professional judgement of teachers is the central element and in which powers abrogated to others in these matters will be returned to the classroom. We will start on a major programme of school refurbishment and repair, using the innovative opportunity created by the STPI that will enable us to do more work, more efficiently. Standing for success The SNP is committed to the full implementation of the McCrone settlement and this will greatly assist in developing a new atmosphere in Scotlands schools. We will re-examine the duties of parents with the aim of ensuring that they play a full partnership role with schools and take responsibility for their children. We shall also bring forward changes in formal parental representation in schools, replacing the present School Board structure with new arrangements taking account of the already expressed views of COSLA and others. We will also pursue other measures, including:- restructuring Her Majestys Inspectorate to consist of a small core of professional managers supported in actual inspection by secondees from schools; introduction of measures that will ease the transition between nursery and primary school; delivery of appropriate and effective training for teachers in information and communication technology; creation of new guidelines on school closures, with a presumption against closure of rural schools except in clearly specified circumstances; and production of high quality teaching materials on Scottish history, language and literature. We will place a duty in law to provide Gaelic medium education where there is reasonable demand and developing Gaelic medium provision in the primary and secondary sectors. We will also conduct a legislative review of the provision of school transport. We support positive steps to ensure that the particular needs of Catholic schools are recognised in professional training and development and that the contribution of Catholic schools to the diversity and richness of the Scottish educational scene is fully realised. We will ensure that the needs of ethnic minority groups are met in mainstream schooling and that anti-racism is a core element in a childs growing understanding of our multicultural society. Other measures will include developing the concept of Community; enhancing the role of community education; assisting teachers to impart the essential elements of citizenship education through their professional development; recognising that mainstream schools with an inclusive orientation are the most effective means of meeting the needs of all learners who share an equal entitlement to be there; properly supporting moves towards more inclusive education for those with special needs; providing support and back up for teachers in difficult circumstances in the classroom; and providing back up where indiscipline and truancy are significant problems. Jobs We will create an economic climate to end unemployment. Our philosophy is based on building on Scotlands strengths, and tackling the weaknesses that inhibit growth. More than anything, we are determined to create a specific Scottish economic policy suited to the economic profile of our nation. Enterprise & Jobs Our programme of infrastructure investment through the Scottish Trust for Public Investment will give Scots businesses improved access to world markets through a modern and reliable road, rail, sea and air network. We will ensure Scotland does not get by-passed by the digital revolution by ensuring that Scotland has direct access to the internet and broadband capacity throughout the country. And our focus on reskilling Scotland will work to ensure that one of the key ingredients of a successful economy, a highly educated, flexible and skilled workforce, is in place to allow both the growth of indigenous enterprises, but also to encourage the relocation of high-skill, value-added international investors to our country. Economic development agencies must become more focused and less bureaucratic. They must be more accessible and less regulatory. Their aim is to facilitate and add value to indigenous and incoming business. They should stimulate not suffocate. Finally, because we believe in Scotland, because we stand for Scotland, we will be best placed to sell Scotland as a marketplace, as a holiday destination and as a key export partner. We will ensure that Scotlands businesses get better and wider representation across the world, and that every effort is made to promote Scotland as a world beating business and tourist centre. To this end, we will bring the tourist agency into Scotlands enterprise network. Tourism Scotlands tourism industry has been under-valued and the Scottish Executive has completely mishandled attempts to revitalise the industry. A confident and quality industry aiming to achieve an ambitious expansion of business levels can be achieved, but only with the correct policy direction. The two key strategic aims in developing the industry must be to market the product and make access cheaper and simpler. The recent structural changes to the Scottish Tourist Board and Visit Scotland recognise that change is required. However, much more remains to be done. Fundamentally, the organisation must move away from seeing itself as a regulatory body to being a marketing body, which sells the product of a holiday or break in Scotland, at home and abroad. More effective marketing and the direct promotion of Scotland to replace the role of the British Tourist Authority is required. We need to ensure that we maximise our profile in our key areas not disperse our resources in peripheral ones. Access to Scotland is fundamental. The lack of a Scottish gateway airport is a clear impediment. Hence, there is a requirement to ensure that our marketing also dovetails with a transport strategy. The SNP will campaign for better transport links for visitors to enter Scotland. Employment The SNP at Westminster will press for devolution of the New Deal to Scotland, and in government will refocus the millions of pounds invested in this programme to create a Better Deal by targeting people living in Scotlands job black spots and providing additional training, support and encouragement for long-term and youth unemployed. This will come as part of a project of national reskilling, and will assist those who too often slip off the statistics and out of the New Deal programme. Minimum Wage The SNP has long supported a minimum wage set at half male median earnings. SNP MPs at Westminster and an SNP government would support an immediate increase of the minimum wage to £4.36 for all Scots regardless of their age. This is a 16°k increase on current levels compared to Labours proposal of a 9°k increase. We would aim to achieve a similar increase for the following year. We would end age discrimination and the minimum wage would apply for all Scots regardless of their age. The lowest paid young Scots working a 40-hour week would gain £2350 a year extra under SNP plans. Workers over 21 on the minimum wage would see an increase in income of £1350 a year. Any such moves would follow discussion with employers and trades unions about implementation. Recognising the possible impact of a higher minimum wage on small businesses in Scotland, the SNPs review of the tax system will develop measures to reduce employment costs for small businesses using the increased revenue that will accrue to the Exchequer from higher tax income resulting from a higher minimum wage, Trades Unions In the last UK Parliament, it was the SNP who stood for Scotlands trades unions by pressing the case for fair ballots for trade union recognition in the workplace, in contrast to the governments system, which meant a majority of votes did not mean recognition. Our support for Scotlands trades unions will continue. We will guarantee the rights of trades unions and the rights of representation for workers through a statutory Charter of Trade Union Rights. We support the EU Directive on collective redundancies and will argue strongly for the ratification of other employee involvement laws. Environment The SNP stands for a clean, safe and sustainable environment in Scotland. With so many key industries - agriculture, tourism and fisheries - dependent on Scotlands environmental image, maintaining and protecting our natural environment must be central to any governments priorities. An SNP government will strive to ensure that Scotland becomes a world leader in securing a sustainable environment and quality of life for all, recognising that local action can have global impact and that environmental problems do not respect national boundaries. We will contribute towards international climate change targets. We oppose the UK government climate change levy and have particular concerns about its impact on hydroelectric power. We will undertake an evaluation of the risks from climate change and will produce a strategy to address these risks. As a first step to securing this objective an SNP government will commission a State of the Nation Environmental Audit to assess Scotlands current position. From this we will establish a National Environment Plan (NEP), which will set stretching standards and targets to meet Scotlands international obligations, and where appropriate, surpass these objectives. In the short term, at Westminster, we will press for SEPA to be given statutory monitoring powers over military facilities in Scotland so that there is proper environmental regulation of MoD practices such as the dumping of depleted uranium in the Solway Firth. In government the SNP will seek to ensure Scotland produces 12% of all its energy requirements from renewable sources by 2010, including 25% of its electricity. We will not build any more nuclear power stations. Existing facilities will be decommissioned at the end of their economic or technical capacity. Dounreay will be supported as an international centre of decommissioning, allowing Scotland to export its expertise. We are committed to the development of a resource efficient culture in Scotland, supporting the key concepts of the ""six Rs"" - Refuse, Reduce, Re-use, Refurbish, Recycle, Recover. The SNP is committed to the Precautionary and Polluter Pays Principles, and in government will introduce an integrated system of pollution prevention and control. As part of our Comprehensive Tax Review, we will examine the system of Landfill Tax Credits. Water An SNP government will undertake an immediate review of the water industry's financial arrangements bringing to an end sky-high increases in water charges and a halt to backdoor privatisation. Suitable protection for low-income households and the voluntary sector will be introduced. The three water quangos will be given a more democratic and accountable structure. An exemption will be sought from the Competition Act, to allow the industry to cope with the significant challenges that it already faces, and consider the implications of competition. Health The SNP recognises that those who work in the health service are already committed to delivering real improvements and we support them in their efforts. We are also supportive of many of the initiatives published in the Scottish Health Plan. The SNPs policy platform is not an alternative to the initiatives that are already planned or underway. What it does is identify key areas where the SNP believes that government could and should go further. A healthy partnership The SNP believes that the National Health Service is too important to be a political football. We will establish a National Health Care Commission (NHCC), chaired by the Minister for Health & Community Care with cross party representation of MSPs, representatives of the health profession and unions together with members of the wider community. The Commission will be charged with setting the strategic direction for NHS Scotland and given a central role in the drive to end postcode treatment. The NHCC will be instrumental in raising morale of health professionals, which is at an all time low, not least in the primary care sector. A recent survey of GPs in Scotland found that nearly 80% did not feel included in changes in the NHS. That must change if there is to be a genuine partnership approach to improving our health service. The Commission will also examine how local healthcare co-operatives can best be empowered to deliver real improvements. Prevention is better than cure Making Scotland a healthier place to live is at the heart of our policy platform. Free fruit in schools. We will target policies and resources in improving the health of Scotlands children and encouraging in our young people - and hopefully their parents -a culture of healthy eating. We will extend on a national basis the practice of a few local authorities of providing free fruit in schools and will provide, during term time, a free daily portion of fruit to every primary school pupil in Scotland. 2.  Healthier school meals. We will also act to regulate the nutritional content of school meals - which for many children is the main meal of the day - to ensure that the food children eat at school meets minimum nutritional standards. Equality of access to health provision and health care The SNP is committed to restoring a system in which access to health care is determined by a professional assessment of clinical need and not by the lottery of a patients residence. The SNP pledges to end postcode treatment within our first term in government. No patient will be denied access to a drug or treatment that has been positively assessed by the Health Technology Board for Scotland (HTBS). The SNP will substantially increase the budget of the HTBS to enable it to expand its workload and increase the number of assessments that it carries out each year. The findings of the HTBS will be binding on health boards. The NHCC will have a central role in the drive to end postcode treatment. It will be for the Commission to identify instances where the care and treatment of patients in any area falls significantly below that in other areas. The NHCC will be empowered to work pro-actively with the relevant health bodies to ensure that effective action is taken to bring the quality of care up to acceptable standards. Dental Health The SNP in government will re-introduce free dental check ups for everyone in Scotland. Prescription charges The SNP will act to end the unfairness inherent in the prescription charges system. We will freeze the level of prescription charges immediately, and establish an independent, short-term working party to review the level of charges and the categories of exemption. Highest quality care and treatment for all We support and will continue the drive to set and maintain national standards of clinical excellence. We will take action to ensure that patients are treated as quickly and as close to home as is possible and clinically appropriate, and in settings that are clean, modern, properly staffed and well equipped. Our early priorities will be to invest in reequipping NHS Scotland and tackling staff shortages. A modern, well-equipped health service The SNP is determined to make significant progress by delivering real investment in our first term. Over the next twenty-five years, the NHS will spend nearly £3 billion under PFI contracts, to service capital investment of only £ 1 billion. Through the STPI, we will lever in considerably more investment to NHS Scotland for the same or greater scale of commitment. We will carry out an audit of the age and effectiveness of existing hospital equipment and use the results of the audit to target capital investment to ensure that our hospitals are at the cutting edge of medical technology. Cleaner hospitals The SNP will invest an extra £4 million in a ""Clean Hospitals Fund"" to enable an immediate clean up of Scotlands hospitals. More nurses We will take action with the aim of employing at least 1,500 more nurses in the health service. We will also launch a nurse recruitment campaign to encourage young people to enter the profession and qualified nurses who have left it to return. Shorter waiting times With the investment that we are promising in hospital buildings, medical equipment and nurses, we believe that maximum waiting times for all inpatient treatment can be cut by half in our first term in office. Free personal care for all elderly people The SNP are committed to free personal care for all elderly people who need it. The SNP remains committed to paying personal care costs in full and will do so on taking office if Labour continues to let Scotlands pensioners down. Europe The SNP stands for Scotland in Europe. The Scottish National Party believes that membership of the European Union will give Scotland real advantages. It will secure for Scotland a voice at the heart of Europe, with full membership of the important decision and policy-making bodies. We support the present confederal union in Europe, and reject moves to a European Super State. We support steps towards enhanced co-operation in defence, foreign affairs, trade and the environment, but reject abandoning national vetoes on issues relating to natural resources, taxation and the constitution. We seek a stronger commitment to subsidiarity, with responsibilities returned to member states in areas such as coastal fisheries under the Common Fisheries Policy. Sharing of sovereignty should be restricted to defined areas where it brings clear benefits. We see advantages in Scottish membership of the single currency, but this can only be achieved when the economic conditions are correct, when an acceptable exchange rate is delivered and where public consent has been given in a referendum. The SNP welcomes an enlarged Union. This will give greater weight and prominence to small and medium sized nations. Clearly, after Nice, Scotland will have significantly greater influence in the European Union as an independent nation than as part of the United Kingdom. At present, Scotland is represented only in the European Parliament - but as part of the UK, we have only half as many MEPs as Denmark or Finland, countries with similar populations. The Treaty of Nice would further reduce MEPs for Scotland within the UK - but provide a better deal for Scotland with Independence. An independent Scotland under the Nice Treaty would have its full quota of 13 MEPs and seven weighted votes in the Council of Ministers plus a member of the European Commission - compared to no votes and no Commissioner within the UK. Defence On Independence we will negotiate the safe removal of Trident from Scotland and an independent Scotland will work to eliminate nuclear, biological and chemical weapons world-wide. Pre-independence we will continue to be part of the coalition against Trident in the UK. But while we have the risk of Trident, we should get the benefit of the jobs at Rosyth, and we will fight any government proposals to remove refitting work from Scotland. SNP MPs will oppose any involvement in a possible US National Missile Defence Programme believing it to be unwise and damaging to international relations between east and west. The SNP stands for co-operation in conventional defence. We will contribute to international security, conflict resolution, peacekeeping and disaster and humanitarian relief through the European Union Common Foreign & Security Policy and European Rapid Reaction Force, the OSCE, EAPC/PfP and the UN. An independent Scotland will inherit a treaty obligation to NATO. However our opposition to nuclear defence will make our continued participation in nuclear alliances difficult. We therefore propose to negotiate a phased withdrawal from NATO but will retain military co-operation with NATO nations through a variety of international involvements. An SNP government will promote the study of the theory and practice of peacekeeping, and will make its skills available to Scottish Defence Force personnel and to the forces of democratically governed nations. The priority of the Scottish Defence Force (SDF), in partnership with Scotland's neighbours, will be to safeguard the land, sea and air space of Scotland. SDF training and equipment will reflect that, as well as the need for rapid deployment overseas. Some units will have specialised training for humanitarian and disaster relief operations. The SDF will initially be equipped with Scotland's negotiated share of UK defence resources. Service and pension conditions will be equal to those of the UK forces, with some enhancements. The SDF will be an all-professional force supported by part time volunteers and jobs will be open to all who meet the appropriate standards. All MoD civilians working in Scotland at Independence will be able to remain in the Scottish MoD or Scottish civil service. Defence industries will be subject to end user scrutiny to ensure that Scotland only exports arms to legitimate sources, and not through third parties to the worst regimes. While Scotland is in the UK the SNP will work to ensure that Scotland obtains a fair share of defence expenditure. Bases at Kinloss, Lossiemouth, Leuchars, Prestwick, Faslane and all barracks and training areas (regular and reserve) will be fully utilised by the SDF and consideration may be given to using regular and reserve sites that have been shut by the UK. Additional accommodation for specialised equipment or personnel may be built on any of the above sites. International Affairs An Independent Scotland will play a full role in the international community through its membership of the European Union, the Commonwealth and the United Nations. We will always promote Scottish interests internationally, ensuring productive and harmonious relationships with the other countries of the world. Where UK embassies are about status, Scottish Embassies would be about business. The SNP would establish a commercially focussed presence for Scotland in the major commercial and population centres of the world by amalgamating the foreign representation of Locate in Scotland, Scottish Trade International and VisitScotland into External Affairs Offices of the Government of Scotland. Scotlands External Affairs department would operate on a budget no greater than the current spending by the Scottish Executive and its Agencies on overseas representation and our population share of Foreign & Commonwealth Office spending. Overseas Development The SNP has a long-standing commitment to raise Scotlands international aid budget to UN recommended levels. We are committed to the cancellation of Third World Debt and poverty eradication, and accept the 2015 International Development Targets. We would seek to reduce Third World debt by pushing for reform of the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative to allow for speedier and wider reaching relief to all countries that are in need. International Aid will be in the form of grants or very low interest loans to avoid increasing the debt burden. The SNP does not believe in ""Aid for Trade"" and would accordingly untie all its aid programmes so that they would not be reliant on buying from Scottish firms, since this may not be appropriate for the recipient country. An SNP government will establish and fund a voluntary secretariat - ""Aid from Scotland"" - to coordinate a unified approach and provide a single point of contact for Scotland's aid agencies, ensuring a quick response to global emergencies. Broadcasting The SNP has consistently argued for legislative oversight of Scottish broadcasting to be the responsibility of the Scottish Parliament. The SNP is keen to see a ""dash for digital"" so that the changeover can establish Scotland's place in the forefront of technological development and we believe the government must work in partnership with providers to ensure that no one is left behind in the digital revolution. The SNP anticipates a growing together of broadcasting, computer and mobile technology and will support and assist those entrepreneurs who seek to make such technologies benefit our nation and the world. We will seek a presence in the UK, European and global media, to continue to campaign for the progressive devolution of powers over budget and schedule to BBC Scotland, and to argue for the Scottish Six. While realistic about the inevitability of change in the rules on cross media ownership, we will continue to seek a strong Scottish presence in worldwide and democratic markets. Sport We see an important role for sport, not only in tackling issues relating to youth crime, but also in ensuring improved health for people in Scotland. The SNP would like to see resources currently available for sport focused more on local and community sporting activities. The SNP supports the creation of Football Academies, and would use existing funds to assist in the creation of a national network of such bodies. We will bid for the 2008 European Football Championships to be based in Scotland. Culture The SNP will radically reform the Scottish Arts Council, first of all by providing direct funding to the National companies (including a new national theatre). From existing resources, we will establish a ""Scottish Academy"" to encourage excellence and to bring forward new talent and we will considerably increase funding for traditional Scottish arts. We will introduce a Scottish Lottery to provide money for good causes including the arts. Gaelic The SNP continues to campaign for secure status for Gaelic as one of the key measures that will assist in supporting and reviving the language. We must put in place measures that stop the decline in the number of Gaelic speakers and create a new generation of Gaelic speakers. This means not only a much wider provision of Gaelic medium education but also the development of new opportunities for adults to become fluent Gaelic speakers, and new ways of accessing such opportunities. Scots The SNP would support measures to improve the teaching of Scots language and literature in schools, and would encourage all forms of the media in positive promotion and usage of the language. Until Independence, the SNP will keep up the pressure on the UK Government to fulfil their obligations to the Scots Language under Part II of the European Charter for Regional and Minority Languages, and seek specification under Part III. In government we will ensure these obligations are fulfilled. Social Justice The SNP is committed to a National Anti-Poverty Strategy, the aim of which is the eradication of structural poverty, both social and economic, as an integral element in the development of an economically dynamic and socially just Scotland with work, education and good health for all. The SNP would also promote ""poverty proofing"" -a process whereby agencies at all levels assess policies and programmes in relation to the likely impact they will have on poverty with a view to poverty reduction  with specific and quantifiable targets the outcomes will be meaningful and achievable. We would transfer the bureaucracy budget of Social Inclusion Partnerships to front line services particularly voluntary organisations dealing with poverty. The SNP abhors the current treatment of asylum seekers, in particular the voucher system, which causes unnecessary hardship for many asylum-seeking families. We also condemn the rhetoric of too many London politicians towards asylum seekers. We would seek fast and fair assessment. Housing The SNP will argue for the UK government to take immediate responsibility for the housing debt accrued by Scottish local authorities as a result of decades of Westminster rule, and as has been done for the privatised water industry in England and Wales . This would relieve the burden of debt servicing from councils, to free up cash for investment in Scotlands housing. Until Independence our team of MPs will press for control over housing benefit to be devolved to the Scottish Parliament so that we can use it as a lever to drive down rents and increase family incomes. We will use the Scottish Trust for Public Investment and the variety of other means available to government to lever in desperately needed investment into housing to do this. We are against wholesale stock transfer of council housing stock. We support smallscale community transfers where the tenants and local communities want it. We would promote housing legislation to cover all tenures. The policy in the rented sector would be based on the principle of Tenants First, Tenure Second. We believe in level playing fields for housing providers and choice for rent and purchase, which is sustainable. Voluntary Sector We will end challenge funding schemes for voluntary organisations, which waste thousands of pounds in preparing unsuccessful bids. We recognise that voluntary organisations require core funding and will consult on methods of funding distribution. This will include three-year core funding arrangements. We will review the existing Voluntary Compact and alleviate concerns that a two-tier voluntary sector has been created. We will review the taxation regime for voluntary organisations, and will exempt voluntary organisations from water charges. Homelessness Homelessness has reached record levels under New Labour. We will work to ensure effective delivery of services to end rough sleeping, tackling the many issues which affect people forced to sleep rough. We will also tackle hidden homelessness by providing homes and the support needed. Equality The SNP has a long held commitment to a constitutionally enshrined guarantee of equal opportunities for all Scots regardless of race, gender, age, Sexuality, disability or social background. We will continue to place this commitment at the centre of our actions both in the House of Commons and in the Scottish Parliament. Until Independence, we will press for legislative powers in this area to be devolved to the Scottish Parliament, as it has been to the Northern Ireland Assembly. Disability Issues Disabled people still face barriers of discrimination in many areas of life. Everyone should be given equality of opportunity to fulfil their potential, no matter who they are, or how able they are. No disabled person should be socially excluded or find themselves in poverty because of their disability. Government has a responsibility to lead the way in ending discrimination against disabled people, challenging attitudes and ensuring that every area of legislation promotes equality of opportunity for disabled people within our society. As a first step, we will extend the powers and scope of the Disability Discrimination Act and introduce a disability equality indicator. Drugs Government must do more to identify dealers and bring them to justice; more to provide focused and relevant education about the dangers of drugs; and more to assist drug misusers with rehabilitation and support. We recognise the need to support families of those misusing drugs and to develop routes out of drug taking for communities affected by the growth in drug abuse. Our additional resources for Scotlands police forces, and the fast-tracking and treatment of drug misusers through Drugs Courts, will allow us to focus more on key elements of the drugs problem in our country. Crime The SNP will increase police resources to tackle crime as well as recognising the rights and responsibilities of citizens in tackling crime. Police Numbers The police are our front line against crime. Public perception is of declining police numbers, a lessening of visible presence on the streets and less security in our homes and communities. It is in recognition of the vital role played by our police that the SNP intends to make available a sum of £25 million specifically to provide 1,000 new officers in Scotland, over and above the existing provision. Every part of Scotland would benefit and there would also be a welcome change in public perception and an increase in public confidence that our streets were truly becoming safer. Citizenship, responsibility and young people It is the right of every individual in society to live safely and securely; to have their privacy respected; and to expect that their property and homes will be secure against criminal activity. However, the right of each individual is balanced by an equivalent responsibility not to behave in ways that deprive others of their rights. We will introduce measures to tackle youth offending because those who begin to are young are likely to continue offending in later life. The SNP believes that it is not just the responsibility of the education system to teach good citizenship - first and foremost it is a job for parents who have primary responsibility for their children. The SNP will consider a further extension of the existing legal responsibility of parents for the actions of their children. While it would not be appropriate to charge parents and take them through the criminal courts for actions committed by their offspring, it is nevertheless our view that it should be possible to institute a form of Compensation Order on parents when the activities of their child have resulted in physical damage to property or tangible upset to a victim. Any provision for such Orders would have to allow both for judicial discretion in imposing them and the ability to take the financial circumstances of the parent/s into account. Nevertheless, the impact on the victim, who is otherwise left with the financial responsibility for a repair that is no fault of theirs, cannot be ignored. Dealing with sex offenders The SNP believes that our criminal justice system should provide for a form of life-time supervision for those offenders for whom it was considered there would never be a point when they were regarded as no longer being a danger. The SNP would move to implement the Maclean Report on Serious Violent & Sexual Offenders - in particular the recommendation for an Order for Lifelong Restriction for high-risk sex offenders. This would ensure constant monitoring and a recall to custody if the Order were breached. We would provide for Supervised Release Orders to be available to the Courts even in Summary Cases. The SNP would ensure that the position is changed to provide that where a victim is over the age of 18, the offender would still be liable to have their name entered onto the Register. Other initiatives There are other key areas where the SNP will take action. We will set up a Sentencing Advisory Panel; speed up the process of criminal cases in the lower courts which would be of benefit to both the accused and to victims; and tackle once and for all the status of those who are deported to Scotland from other countries after having served sentences for very serious offences. The SNP at Westminster will also argue very strongly that as long as the current devolved arrangements prevail, Scotland should continue to get increases in money earmarked for justice initiatives equivalent to those available in England and Wales. As part of this process we will continue to argue that the proportion of Fixed Penalty money and fine money, which at present is deposited with HM Treasury, is retained for use in Scotland and reinvested in our criminal justice system. Taxation No one in Scotland today knows how much they pay to the Government in taxation. Under Labour the tax system has become increasingly complex. The imposition of more and more stealth taxes has broken the democratic link between the government that sets and spends taxes and the people that pay them. Complex taxation is inefficient as well as undemocratic. Labour have more than doubled the number of tax rates since they took power. On top of that there are more than 250 complex tax allowances, credits and disregards. The overall cost of administering the UKs tax system is estimated by the Inland Revenue at 1.1 p for every £1 collected in tax. In Ireland the cost is 0. 88p. Reducing the cost of collection to the Irish level would save £90 million next year alone - money that could be invested in public services. Labour like the Tories have increased the share of tax that is levied indirectly and takes no account of peoplé s ability to pay. We want to tackle all of these problems with practical solutions. It is not acceptable for political parties to mislead the people about taxation in elections. We pledge to bring honesty and clarity to the debate with a series of proposals on taxation based on the following principles: 1 We will not introduce any new measures to increase the overall burden of taxation or increase the rate of income tax without consulting the people first through our manifesto. 2 We will undertake a Comprehensive Review of Taxation (CRT) to deliver fairness, simplicity, transparency and honesty in the taxation system. The CRT will have a remit to produce reform proposals that taken together do not increase the overall burden of taxation. One of our key aims in this review will be to cut business taxation. Moreover we will not implement the full proposals of the CRT without putting them to the people in our next manifesto. All our taxation policies will be informed by these core principles and for this election we offer the following specific proposals. In advance of the CRT we propose one initial measure to fulfil our commitments to drive fuel prices down and to shift the burden of taxation from unfair stealth taxation to honest fair taxation. We believe that both these commitments require honest policy decisions now so in advance of the CRT we will cut taxation on fuel by 10p a gallon (including VAT). This cut in taxation will cost £65m and will be paid for by introducing an extra 5p band of income taxation for those with taxable earnings over £ 100,000 per year (affecting only ten thousand of the wealthiest Scots) . The Treasury estimates that this will raise £80 million paying easily for the fuel tax cut . Any surplus in in revenues from this measure will be directed towards further reductions in duty as part of the process of achieving our target of bringing fuel prices into line with our competitors in Europe. Taken together therefore these two measures are redistributive and will be revenue neutral. Local Government The SNP will stand up for local government and for proper long term funding of council services. In particular, we support a comprehensive review of local government finance including investigation of a local income tax to replace the current council tax. We recognise the need to adequately reward staff and will work with local authorities and trades unions to improve conditions for public sector workers. We stand for the right of local government to subsidiarity and the continued direct delivery of public services. We support proportional representation and the introduction of single transferable voting to elect councillors. Rural Communities The foot-and-mouth disease brought into sharp focus the great difficulties which businesses face in rural Scotland, and how vulnerable they are. Even before the outbreak began, rural Scotland faced economic problems. Rural Scotland now faces economic problems on an unprecedented scale, as a result of a series of disastrous policies pursued by successive London governments. The SNP supports the following policy measures, with the aim of providing a level playing field for the rural economy. Small businesses are the bedrock of the rural economy. We will address each of the barriers to growth and success of small business. We will use our tax review to consider proposals for a small business rates relief scheme, which will seek to end the unfair burden which business rates pose for our small business. The rural economy could be boosted by the promotion of information and communication technology based businesses and teleworking. This potential has not yet been realised. We support an immediate cut in excise duty on fuel of 10 pence per gallon, and in the longer term will aim to reduce the burden of fuel tax to European average levels. The burden of fuel costs is particularly high for rural communities and we will use government power and influence to end the outrage of substantially higher prices in the Highlands and Islands. We will seek to direct more resources and effort in improving rural public transport and the rural transport infrastructure. Governments role should be to reduce the unnecessary barriers and burdens facing rural producers. We will work to free up available euro cash, like agrimonetary compensation and support for scallop farmers. The SNP is determined to ensure that key services such as rural sub post offices, rural schools and rural transport links remain at the heart of rural Scotland. An SNP government will ensure contingency funds are used to compensate business affected by the current crisis and are available for use in the event of future crises in the rural economy. Agriculture The foot-and-mouth crisis across the UK has served to confirm the fragility of agriculture and its related industries and also the sectors importance to Scotland. There will need to be a comprehensive review of agricultural strategy once the current foot and mouth disease has been controlled. That review will need to look very carefully at many issues of concern. These include procedures of entry into our ports, laxity of import controls on meat, mandatory country of origin labelling, use of food remains and the role of locally based abattoirs and processing plants. Until we get Independence, the SNP is determined to see Scottish ministers have a more direct involvement in European decision making, and will continue to press for a direct and distinct voice for Scottish ministers at European Council meetings. The SNP is determined to ensure a level playing field for our farmers in Europe. Where the UK government has allowed competitive disadvantage for key sectors by the early and fullest implementation of European rules , the SNP in government will only seek to introduce into domestic law European regulations when they have been adopted and applied in full by a majority of European nations. This will ensure that our farmers are not forced to operate under more restrictive and more expensive rules than farmers elsewhere within the EU, and will therefore be more able to compete fairly in European markets. With the SNP in government, agriculture policy will be developed in the interests of Scotlands farming community and in response to specific Scottish circumstances, rather than as a follow on to events elsewhere in the UK. This strategy will extend into the rural economy, with resources focused on diversification of efforts, promotion of specialised agriculture - such as free-range herds and organic produce, where Scotland already has a natural advantage  and with specific efforts to promote the export of quality Scottish produce. The SNP believes the Less Favoured Areas deal will cause financial hardship for many farmers and crofters and must be ameliorated. This should be done by the Scottish Executive using funds from other sources, such as modulation, and by a comprehensive renegotiation of the original deal. Fisheries Recent events have demonstrated clearly why the voice of the fishing communities must be heard. The SNP favours compensated tie-up schemes as an essential component of government aid packages. This would allow the fishing fleet to remain viable, protect juvenile stocks, and protect the long-term future of the Scottish white fish fleet. Working with the industry, we will promote the introduction of technical conservation measures that will ensure our coastal communities are able to benefit from sustainable fisheries. At Westminster we will continue to seek designation of Scottish fisheries ministers as the UK lead in Europe and will demand the return of the 6000 square miles of fishing grounds removed from Scottish jurisdiction by the government in London. While ensuring the Common Fisheries Policy guarantees Scotlands historic fishing rights, the SNP will seek its reform to include as a main principle the decentralisation of fisheries management through the establishment of Zonal Fisheries Management Councils. We will support the fish processing industry to ensure its continued competitiveness, and assist Scotlands aquaculture sector to become a world leader. In addition, we will pursue a level playing field for the industry, to ensure that our fishermen and fish processors do not face additional cost and regulatory burdens as compared to our closest competitors. Salmon Farming We will instruct a wide ranging and independent inquiry into fish farming in Scotland, following which we would seek to frame a long term strategy for the future of salmon farming, with particular regard to the need for Scotland to be competitive in relation to Ireland, Norway and other salmon farming countries, and the securing of effective regulation of the industry and the safeguarding of the environment. We would ensure that SEPA has the resources to carry out their tasks, by ending the payment of rent to the Crown Estate Commission. Land The SNP has long been at the forefront of the campaign to modernise Scotlands land laws and to give communities increased say, control and involvement in the land. We will continue to press for control of the Scottish Land Fund to be transferred from the London based trustees of the New Opportunities Fund to the Scottish Parliament. We support community right to buy, but believe that more effective mechanisms must also be put in place to ensure greater involvement for communities who want to participate in decision-making in relation to their land but want to stop short of ownership. Freshwater Fishing We will work with anglers and local communities to create a national freshwater fisheries policy that will ensure access, maximise economic benefit for our rural economy and ensure the protection of the environment. Pensions We stand for restoring the link between the basic state pension and average earnings. We will press for the link to be restored at a UK level, and with Independence, will restore the link for Scotlands pensioners each year for the term of the next Parliament. This would mean that by the end of the next parliament pensioners could gain up to £200 a year in addition to Labours plans. We will pay for this by utilising the surplus in the National Insurance Fund that has been created by the existing generation of pensioners. An SNP government will examine proposals that will ensure pensioners who have small occupational pensions, or who are near the current threshold of income for taxation are not penalised by the tax treatment of these increases in the basic state pension. As part of this we will examine proposals to allow a Scottish government to remove the distortions and inequities caused by the differentials between the Minimum Income Guarantee (MIG) and the basic state pension -a means testing that discriminates against too many on low incomes who have saved for their old age. It is our aim to work to equalise the basic state pension and the level of the MIG as resources become available. The SNP continues to support the payment of a cold climate allowance - paid to pensioners throughout the winter months. As a first step to achieving this aim, we will on a weekly basis spread payments of the current winter fuel assistance over the winter months. Social Security An SNP government will examine the level of bureaucracy within the social security system. This will take three forms. Firstly we will examine the structure for social security delivery. Where as the UK has the bureaucracy and waste of three separate social security agencies, / the SNP will investigate the creation of a single agency responsible for the streamlining of benefit payments at all levels in Scotland. Secondly we will examine the actual delivery of key benefits to minimise bureaucracy and cost. For example, we will undertake a review of housing benefit. It is our belief that the rules can be simplified and the process of payment accelerated. Our overall aim however is to re-direct housing benefit to drive down housing costs and improve family incomes. The core purpose of our review will be to simplify and increase the effectiveness of the system. Finally, we will examine the workings and effectiveness of each benefit, with the aim of removing unnecessary barriers to uptake and to increasing support to key groups. Disability benefits We will streamline the application process and review the tests and timescales to ensure those who are entitled to support get it quickly. We will also consider proposals to review Welfare to Work beneficiary rules so that disabled people moving into work are not penalised financially. We will also reform financial support for carers so the system reflects the value of and savings to the state that their caring provides to society. Winter fuel allowance It is our aim to extend the winter fuel allowance to severely disabled people under 60 as resources become available. Benefits for 16-17 year olds We will review overall financial support available to 16 and 17 year olds including targeted restoration of benefits as resources become available. Working Families Tax Credit In general we support initiatives to help families from welfare to work. We will however examine the delivery of the Working Families Tax Credit, which can lead to prohibitive levels of marginal taxation sometimes up to 96% as people lose out on other benefits e.g. housing benefit. Because it is a benefit that has to be applied for, we would also examine concerns over the take up rate for Working Families Tax Credit, discrepancies in how some employers can abuse the system and examine options to ensure that more families access the money available. Benefit take up We support the provision of information and advice as an essential part of benefit take up campaigns. Transport At Westminster, our MPs will press to ensure that Scotland gets her fair share of the UK governments transport investment - investment that currently will not be distributed on a population basis. In government, we will use the STPI to bring in lower cost private investment. An efficient and effective transport network is the key to Scotlands success, socially and economically. We recognise that it is the job of government to provide the delivery framework and the focus to help people and goods get to where they want to go. An SNP government would set out the overall strategy and frameworks. Regional Transport Authorities (RTAs) will be publicly accountable and will be responsible for the delivery of regional transport solutions. We will introduce a single safety authority for all forms of transport. Air safety is paramount and Air Traffic Control will remain under public sector control. Initially we would take shares for subsidy to create a public sharé of Railtrack to guarantee a level of public accountability without ruling out the possibility of public ownership. We would reconnect communities and re-open key strategic lines including direct rail links with airports. We would develop a strategy to systematically deal with the electrification of key rail lines. Our priority routes include: Electrification of the East Coast main line Edinburgh airport link Reopening of the Borders rail line Stirling - Alloa - Rosyth ferry port Glasgow Cross City Rail and airport link project Inverness - Aberdeen (Orton loop). We would work with providers to achieve a national concessionary travel scheme for children and young adults under 18, students, Pensioners and people with disabilities and their carers. We will consult on the introduction of light rail systems for Scotlands cities to help relieve traffic congestion. We will initiate a national care and repair programme of existing roads. We will initiate a limited programme of road building to tackle bottlenecks and to fill gaps of roads unfinished by previous Labour and Tory administrations. Our early priorities for investment through the STPI and a range of other delivery mechanisms are: M74 extension Aberdeen City by-pass A8000 link (M9/M8) A75 M8 link (Newhouse - Ballieston) Upgrading of the A9 The SNP is committed to bringing forward proposals for the reduction in ferry fares in Scotland as part of a process towards the piloting and evaluation of Road Equivalent Tariffs. Academic research has suggested that lower ferry fares could be introduced on a cost neutral basis. Equal treatment for island communities will be at the core of decision making in an SNP government. We would promote freight and passenger hub airports in Scotland, and conduct a Scottish airports review aimed at increasing direct flights from Scotland to Europe and placing downward pressure on fare prices and landing charges, with a particular focus on the large supplement fares paid by Scottish consumers for holiday charter flights. In line with our long standing commitment we will abolish tolls on the Skye Bridge as an early priority and will explore the opportunities of bringing the bridge into trust for the nation under the STPI.

"UKIP",200106,"Introduction: The UK Independence Party The Economy Health, Social Security and Pensions Education Transport and The Environment Home Affairs Agriculture & Fisheries Defence and Foreign Affairs The Constitution Summary Index & Authors   Introduction: The Party  The UK Independence Party was founded in 1993 to seek 's withdrawal from the European Union. We have attracted membership from Labour, Conservative and Liberal-Democrat backgrounds - principled men and women who want their country back. The UKIP has grown steadily as more people see through the European 'project'. We are now the fourth political party - in 1999, we won three seats in the European Parliament, a platform we use to reveal the truth about the EU.  The UKIP is a non-racist, non-sectarian party. It includes British people of all backgrounds who value individual freedom, tolerance and our right to govern ourselves. The UKIP really believes in and 's future as an independent nation competing in the world. We are not 'anti-European', but we oppose British membership of an EU that stifles our initiative and threatens our freedom. We do not seek to abolish the EU, for we believe that each nation in should decide its own future. has no more right to control them than they have to impose their will on us.  The UKIP is the only political party contesting the General Election that will never abolish the pound for the euro and will never abandon British common law, the right to trial by jury or the presumption of innocence. Indeed we are the only party left that genuinely believes in freedom - freedom for the individual, freedom for businesses and local communities, freedom from patronising 'political-correctness' and from intolerance or injustice. We seek an independent, outward-looking , not the offshore province of a centralised '', whose people are told what to do and what to think.  In 1975, the British people voted for the 'Common Market' in good faith. They were told it was going to be a genuine common market - an association of independent, freely trading nation states. Instead, we have the European Union: centralised, bureaucratic, unaccountable and corrupt, eroding our independence and dictating policies that we would never vote for in an election.  Not only is our currency under threat, but our entire legal system, our British nationality, our right to free speech and freedom of association, our police, our armed forces, our own agricultural policy, our right to trade freely and the parliamentary system that underpins British liberty.  The EU has shown itself to be one of the largest confidence tricks in human history. It claims to 'give us rights' while removing basic freedoms. It 'gives us money' while costing us billions of pounds per year. EU subsidies are like crumbs from the cake we have made. The UKIP rejects the absurd logic of rule from .  The other parties are not telling us the truth about the EU. Despite all experience, the Labour Party still boasts about taking the lead in the EU and helping to shape its future. The Liberal-Democrats claim to believe in individual freedom but would reduce us to powerlessness within the EU. The Greens claim to believe in 'acting locally' but want us to be ruled by the Strasbourg Parliament. The Tories pretend that we can be 'in Europe but not run by '. We say that 'in the EU means ruined by the EU'.  The European Commission in intends that there shall be an EU 'government', an EU 'army' and an EU 'constitution'. This proves to us that it is time to withdraw, rather than go on pretending that we can compromise.  The UKIP will repeal the European Communities Act (1972) that binds into the European Union, and enter into trade agreements with our former 'partners'. Whatever their claims, the leading members of the Tory, Labour and Liberal-Democrat parties all remain committed to continued EU membership. These professional politicians don't want us to run our own country or control our own lives. The UKIP, by contrast, is a moderate, mainstream party which believes in the British people and can offer them a life outside the Euro-state.   The Economy  Free Trade and Globalisation  When leaves the European Union, we shall be able to take full advantage of trading opportunities throughout the world, and not just in . With its external tariff barriers, the EU prevents us from trading freely and fairly on the world stage, particularly in agricultural products. The UK Independence Party supports genuine free trade.  is the world's fourth largest economy and the second largest global investor (after the ). It can hardly be said that we are 'too small to survive alone'. is also head of the Commonwealth - the largest international club except for the UN itself. This international grouping includes a quarter of the world's population. It is a free association of independent nations which share our language, culture and approach to business. This is a far better model for international relations than the centralised, increasingly tyrannical EU.  Through the Commonwealth, has links with some of the world's fastest growing economies, such as those of the Indian subcontinent. Our relationship with the remains unique. These connections equip us to take advantage of global opportunities. EU membership, by contrast, holds us back in the world - it locks us into an over-regulated system based on the principle of 'the state knows best'.  When leaves the EU, we need not fear that our trade with the European Union would cease. On the contrary, since we continually buy more from our European neighbours than we sell to them, it would not be in their interests to reduce their trading links with us. Moreover those who claim that our Japanese and other inward investors would leave should bear in mind that access via to European markets is not the only reason why they are here. Other strong reasons are our language, our business methods, and our flexible labour force. Indeed, the opportunities resulting from a more prosperous EU-free world-trading , will be a magnet to new investment both from outside and within the .  Since our entry to the 'Community' in 1973, the , a global economy, has been unable to negotiate any trade deals with the rest of the world. Freedom from the EU means that can act as a force for good in the world. As a powerful and independent economy, we would be entitled to our seat at the World Trade Organisation and in a position to help shape its policies so that there is more genuine free trade, and less protectionism on behalf of big companies or rich countries.  Outside the EU, we can build strong trading relationships with the rest of the world, including Commonwealth countries and the North American Free Trade Area. It is ironic that the European Commission could negotiate with - or even join - NAFTA. Britain cannot make such decisions because Tory and Labour governments have signed our sovereignty away.  The UKIP is the only party to support free and fair trade for a free country.  Regulatory Reform  In addition to the gains derived from free global trade, another substantial benefit that becomes possible on leaving the EU is the removal of a whole range of damaging and unnecessary regulations.  The guiding principle of the EU, as set out in the treaties, is centralised control. The treaties give the European Commission the task of creating regulations and directives in the areas of health and safety, the environment, employment, and the single market. And while the European Parliament provides a façade of democracy, our own national parliament merely rubber-stamps all the rules before they are passed in UK law, often with extra 'gold-plating' by our own officials. This process has given rise to some 25,000 separate UK regulations since 1973, and few business and activities escape.  There is no point in pretending that we can pick and choose between EU regulations, or that we can 'negotiate' and 'opt out'. Even where we have successfully resisted EU laws, the EU Commission brings them back in another form.  One example of a senseless EU rule is compulsory metrication. The UKIP is not against traders using metric units, but we believe in choice. It cannot be right to make criminals out of people who choose to weigh vegetables in pounds and ounces. As another example, the spread of foot and mouth disease has been made much worse by the large distances that animals now have to travel. This is a direct consequence of the closure of hundreds of small abattoirs because they could not afford the new and evidently ineffective veterinary inspection rules.  The destructive effect that this flood of regulations has on employment is obvious. Regulation inevitably adds costs to business, and most of all it damages the smaller businesses that provide for two-thirds of British jobs. Regulation hurts family firms, the self-employed, co-operatives and ethnic minority businesses. Employment regulations in particular interfere with job creation, especially part-time jobs which offer opportunities to women, the under-25s and older workers. The bureaucratic burden associated with regulation has also become intolerable. According to the Federation of Small Businesses, businesses with 10-14 employees are now spending thirty-one hours per month on paperwork.  In contrast to the small business sector, large corporations are far better able to cope with regulation. Indeed they have the power to lobby the Brussels Commission to frame laws that are favourable to them. This is why many multi-nationals support the euro and want an EU superstate. It suits their interests to divide the world into regional power blocs. National governments and different legal systems are inconveniences they could do without.  The UKIP is not 'against' multi-nationals. On the contrary, we welcome their contribution to the economy. But we seek a trading environment in which small and medium sized businesses are allowed to compete fairly. We are for independence, diversity and choice, not regulation, bureaucracy and conformity.  On withdrawal from the EU, the UK Independence Party will make a 'bonfire' of inappropriate regulations. And recognising the contribution that smaller employers make to the UK economy, we would pay particular attention to scrapping unnecessary rules from businesses employing fewer than 20 people. Freed from excessive rules and red tape, business enterprise will thrive and the UKIP believes this will lead to a marked improvement in employment.  The UKIP accepts that some regulation is necessary in any civilised society, for instance to balance the rights (and responsibilities) of workers and employers. But laws must be respected, easily understood and sympathetically applied, otherwise they invite corruption and dishonesty.  In particular, the UKIP insists that British law must be designed by our own elected representatives at national or local levels, using our own established democratic procedures. We must never again allow the power to make our laws to be placed in the hands of an autocratic machine over which we have no control.  The Independence Dividend  The other major economic benefit from leaving the EU is the substantial 'Independence Dividend' consisting of cash that will be saved when we no longer have to contribute to the EU budget, and savings that will accrue from other sources as a directly result of our independence ^2^. While the main parties spend their time trying to ridicule each other's tax and spending plans, the UK Independence Party will be in the uniquely favourable position of having an extra fund of some £20 billion per year to use as we see fit.  On leaving the EU, Britain's gross contribution to the EU budget of £8.5 billion per year (with the threatened removal of the Fontainebleau rebate and other structural adjustments this will rise to £11 billion per year) will become immediately available to the Treasury. While the agricultural subsidies and structural fund grants (£4.5 billion) that the UK currently _receives from the EU will also cease, the UKIP proposes a partial replacement of these expenditures from the UK's own budget, as detailed below._  In addition to saving our annual £8.5 billion EU payment, there are several other sources of funds to the Independence Dividend that the Treasury will receive on British withdrawal from the EU. The main components of this improvement to the UK budget are as follows. First, higher economic growth resulting from wholesale regulatory reform will bring extra tax revenues (given existing tax rates) and lower demands for benefit payments, which we conservatively estimate to be worth £4.5 billion and £1.5 billion respectively. Secondly, the reduction in the cost of bureaucracy as a result of deregulation across the whole range of government departments and government-funded agencies could raise a further £4 billion. Finally, as a separate substantial item, we estimate that the gain in revenues less subsidies from re-establishing our own fishing industry will be £1.5 billion.  These sources together add a further £11.5 billion to the £8.5 billion saving in our gross contribution to the EU. On these estimates, the total Independence Dividend of extra funds available to the Treasury as a consequence of leaving the EU is of the order of £20 billion per year (£22.5 Billion when rebates cease).  Spending the Independence Dividend  Elsewhere in this manifesto, several additional demands on the national budget are proposed, funded from the Independence Dividend. The main items of expenditure and the approximate amounts are as indicated below.  An amount of £2 billion per year is budgeted for subsidies to agriculture. These will replace funding that is currently received under the Common Agricultural policy (CAP), and provide for the separate initiatives such as the Land Management Contract Scheme and other targeted assistance to agriculture and the countryside. To replace the grants that are currently received under the EU's structural funds, an amount of £1 billion per year is allocated for continuing support to regions of high unemployment.  In the UKIP's welfare provisions, the proposed increase of £5 per week in state pensions will cost £2.8 billion per year, and an amount of £0.5 billion is suggested for increased spending on care for the elderly and £0.3 billion to restore pension levels to ex-pat UK pensioners whose pensions have been frozen since leaving the UK.  The UKIP's main change to taxation is to reduce tax for the lower paid and to remove a further 1 million individuals out of tax altogether, at a cost of £1.4 billion per year. Other items of tax reform, in particular the reintroduction of the married person's tax allowance for families with children under 18, and reform of capital taxes, would absorb a further £1.3 billion.  We propose an increase in the annual NHS budget of £2 billion, and an additional sum of £0.5 billion to raise the income of nursing staff. Increasing the numbers of teachers by 30,000 in order to reduce class sizes and 25,000 more police will cost £1.2 billion and £0.8 billion per year respectively.  The UKIP proposes to reduce the taxation on petrol and diesel fuel by 40p per gallon (9p per litre) which would cost approximately £3.7 billion. Finally an increase of £2.5 billion per year is earmarked for additional spending on defence personnel and defence equipment.  Taken together, these additional expenditures amount to £20 billion per year, equal to the amount available from the Independence Dividend.  Taxation  Excessive taxation - of individuals and businesses - stifles initiative, reduces employment and encourages dishonesty. It also makes Britain less competitive in the global marketplace. Tax policy should be framed to encourage investment, to enhance our global competitiveness, and to create rather than remove incentives to work and save.  The UKIP believes that these criteria call for a wholesale reappraisal of British tax arrangements over the longer term. However, one area in which immediate relief can be granted is tax for the lower paid, making employment more attractive. The UKIP will raise the starting threshold for income tax with the object of removing a further 1 million lower paid individuals altogether from tax, with suitable adjustments so as to leave higher rate taxpayers unaffected. The UKIP will also immediately consider the reform of capital gains tax and inheritance tax, and will remove the main family residence from inheritance tax and introduce further IHT exemptions.  In addition to tax reduction, the UKIP believes there is much to be gained by simplification of our system of taxation, an issue that successive UK governments have only made worse, an example being the new system of tax credits. The complexity of our taxes is completely out of hand, and it causes assessment to be an excessive burden both to the revenue authorities and to taxpayers and their professional advisers, besides leading to errors. In consultation with business and with the Accountancy and Taxation Institutes, the UKIP would aim for a taxation system that is fair and reasonable with simple, concise and clear objectives. In particular we should aim for taxes that are easy to calculate and collect without resort to the courts. The Tax Faculty of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales describes the problem in frank terms^3^  ""Britain's tax system has spun out of democratic control and become detached from the principles of good revenue raising.""  The UKIP would pay immediate attention to simplifying or scrapping the self-assessment system, and to the procedures involved in calculating value added tax (VAT). We also note that VAT is an EU tax - our membership of the EU obliges us to use the VAT system. Outside the EU, the UKIP would be in a position to consider the merits of replacing VAT by a tax applied to retail sales.  Above all, freedom from the EU would forever remove the threat of 'tax harmonisation'. The European Commission remains insistent on this measure as part of its obsession with promoting its own notion of 'competitiveness'. For the UK, tax harmonisation would imply that our tax rates rise to the generally higher levels prevailing in other EU countries. There has, for instance, been no relaxation in the EU's continued pressure for the UK to apply VAT to basic food, childrens' clothing, books, transport and other items that are currently 'zero-rated'.  Average unemployment in the rest of the EU remains around twice as high as in the UK, despite the recent economic growth in euro-zone countries. The UKIP associates this difference with the UK's lower taxes, lighter regulation and general approach to business, all of which are being eroded by our continuing participation in the European Union.  The setting of tax rates is one of the most fundamental duties of our elected government. The UKIP is the only party that can promise that this responsibility is not progressively handed to Brussels.  The Single Currency and Monetary Policy  On leaving the EU, Britain will no longer have to live under the uncertainty of whether or not we shall join the euro, and our public institutions can stop spending our money on preparing for the euro. Britain will keep the pound - forever - not just for the next parliament or until some UK government declares that the 'time is right' to join.  At best, the euro would provide Britain with no more than trivial economic gains, while the downside risks are very serious. The one-size-fits-all interest rate that Britain would adopt as part of the euro-zone would make boom-and-bust cycles worse, as the Irish economy is now demonstrating. And as our EU neighbours keep telling us, the main motivation for the euro is not economic gain anyway; its purpose is to further the cause of 'ever closer union' with the main levers of economic policy handed to EU institutions. As with taxation policy, it is hard to accept that any British government could even contemplate surrendering this essential responsibility.  With the £-sterling firmly retained as Britain's currency, the UKIP would continue the present arrangement in which the Bank of England has 'independence' in its choice of interest rates. Since 1997, the Bank has demonstrated its ability to control £-sterling inflation, and has established a better record in this respect than the euro-zone's European Central Bank. While the Bank must remain accountable to the government, the UKIP believes that low and steady inflation provides the best monetary environment for business and employment to thrive.   Health, Social Security and Pensions  The National Health Service  Britain, which has the world's fourth largest economy, deserves a first class National Health Service. In many respects our NHS works well in providing excellent care at a lower cost compared with systems in other countries, thanks to the doctors, nurses and other health professionals who work immensely hard to maintain standards. But problems arise because of management methods that are too centralised, cumbersome and bureaucratic. Moreover the system requires additional - but properly managed - financial support, to bring a genuine reduction in waiting lists, and to provide for an ageing population and the development of new drugs and treatments.  The UKIP believes that hospitals should reintroduce proven, traditional management structures. Under present arrangements, responsibility has become fragmented, with different individuals responsible for the various aspects of care. Conflicts arise because of the differing objectives of administrators and those responsible for treatment. The UKIP favours a return to the 'matron' system where a single manager is responsible for all 'hotel services' and 'caring' functions. This change will go a long way towards addressing the current problems of hospital infection and clinical malpractice.  Nursing must be seen as a rewarding career with good pay and prospects. Salaries must be increased to attract high calibre nurses - and, crucially, to retain them in the Health Service, in particular by extending salary scales to reward proficiency and experience. With regard to training, we believe that the pursuit of increasingly academic qualifications for hospital workers should be reconsidered, with more emphasis placed on practical competence. Freedom from the EU will allow more scope to make up the current shortfall in NHS staff levels by recruiting suitable applicants from other countries.  Links between NHS Trusts and their local communities are crucial to first class health care. Governing bodies should be more accountable to the communities they serve. Effective reform depends on peeling away the layers of bureaucracy that obstruct the NHS and impede the delivery of patient care. Patients should be treated as individuals, not mere statistics, and should be given as much consideration and choice as possible. We believe that money should be spent on treating patients, not on management consultants, and politically-correct excesses. It is a disgrace that part of the NHS budget is being spent on 'preparation' for the euro. The UKIP has no ideological bias against the private sector, which we regard as an essential part of the nation's health provision.  The UKIP shares the widespread public alarm about the impersonal and bureaucratic nature of social service provision. This can lead to a patronising, dictatorial approach to communities, and at worst to acts of tragic incompetence and injustice. Britain has many first-class social workers, but the system they work in takes responsibility away from local communities and takes little account of individual needs. The UKIP is determined to review social service provision so that it is more accountable and less doctrinaire. Training and working practices for social workers will be reviewed so that there is less emphasis on 'political correctness', and more emphasis on solving practical problems for individuals and communities.  In other words, the UKIP supports a return to the original principles of the NHS: a health care system that serves local communities and responds to people's needs. We want a health service with decentralised management and a minimum of red-tape, and a health service that enables doctors, nurses and other health workers to re-establish the respect they deserve. The UKIP promotes the ethos of public service, and deplores its erosion by successive Tory and Labour governments.  Social Security  Welfare provision is an area in pressing need of reform, not just because it absorbs over £100 billion per year or 35% of the national budget, but also because benefit payments provide disincentives to work, self-provision, and help within the family and community. But the reform of welfare policy is politically difficult because a large proportion of the population receives payments, and because an increasing amount of our social law is being forced to follow EU norms.  Not surprisingly, the efforts of successive governments to tackle these problems have been disappointing. Too often, changes have been to minor details such as the conditions applied in means testing, rather than any fundamental aspects of the system. And this continuous revision of the rules has had the adverse effect of adding even more complexity to an already complex system. This has had a number of unfortunate consequences. First, there has been an increase in the numbers of people who do not claim their entitlements because they are unable to complete the necessary forms, or are unwilling to answer all the demeaning questions. Secondly, each new complication adds to the administrative cost which is already over £3 billion. Finally, the more complex the system, the easier it is for benefit cheats to find ways of avoiding detection, and the more tiresome it is for officials to attempt to check up on them.  A further unfortunate result of expanding state provision and other government policies has been to undermine the family as the basic stable unit of society. The family, preferably with two committed parents, is the best environment for raising secure and confident children. In this connection, the UKIP will restore tax advantages to married couples with children under the age of eighteen. We shall also review current legal practices that seem to favour divorce and allow parents to escape financial and moral responsibility for their children.  While the benefit system clearly merits wholesale reform, the UKIP's first priority will be simplification. Our objective will be to make the rules as transparent as possible in order to cut down on administration, to make claiming easier for those who are genuinely entitled to payments, and to reduce the opportunities for fraud. The general objective of other reforms will be to free as many as possible from benefit culture by ensuring that the net income gained from working, either part-time or full-time, is always greater than the benefits foregone. Benefits should also be more easily transferable from one authority to another in order to facilitate labour mobility.  One particular option that we intend to consider is the replacement of benefit payments in certain cases by a basic income which would not be withdrawn if the individual takes on part-time employment. We envisage that unemployed workers with more then twenty years work experience, and single mothers with school age children may be among those who would qualify for such assistance. In particular this should be considered for 'post-industrial' areas, where mature skilled workers cannot find employment. Advantages of a basic income are that it is straightforward to administer and not so open to fraud.  The main aim of the UKIP's benefit policy will be to reduce the numbers of those who need it, and to restore people to independence from benefits and to the dignity that comes with it.  Pensions and the Elderly  The UK Independence Party believes that pensioners deserve a share of the Independence Dividend of cash that will flow from Britain's withdrawal from the European Union and we propose to raise the universal state pension by £5 per week. In addition, we recognise the hardship that some elderly people are enduring as a result of a shortage of funds for residential care, and we respect those who wish to remain living in their homes but cannot afford the necessary care. We have therefore allocated a sum of £0.5 billion to assist in these two areas. We will additionally restore the full UK pension to expatriate pensioners whose pensions have been frozen since their departure from the UK at a cost of £0.3 billion.  There is however another issue that the UKIP wishes to address. As the UK population ages, the cost to the exchequer of state pensions is rising, and it is expected to rise considerably after 2010. The UKIP is prepared to face the fact that the current pay-as-you-go system for state pension provision will become difficult to sustain in the long run.  The UKIP will therefore investigate a system in which individuals are required to divert part of their National Insurance contributions into their own private pension funds, and these would replace the state pension on their retirement. As time passes the demand for state pensions would thus gradually diminish, and eventually the state would provide only for those who were unable to provide sufficiently for themselves. The great advantage of private pensions is that they restore the connection between contributions and the eventual payout, and the rate of return to contributions reflects the returns available in financial markets: it cannot be reduced by the government's appropriation of some of the funds. The government's windfall receipts from the sale of airwave licences would be a useful source of funds to make up the initial shortfall in National Insurance revenue. Existing pensioners would be unaffected by this scheme.  Many people in Britain are already members of private occupational pension schemes, or have taken out personal pension policies. This has partly been a response to tax incentives which the present government has largely withdrawn, but the UKIP would restore. This has placed Britain in a far better position than several other EU countries. There is little private pension provision in Germany and Italy, for instance, and so the pension 'overhang' in these countries is much greater than in the UK. It is widely acknowledged that these unfunded pension liabilities will become a serious burden, and this is a concern for Britain as a member of the EU because of the likelihood that we shall be obliged to assist through the EU budget.   Education  Schools  An independent Britain requires a qualified, well-trained population with the skills and knowledge needed to compete in the world. But education has wider purposes, too: the pursuit of knowledge for its own sake, the transmission of cultural values, and the creation of good citizens with the inquiring minds required for a free society. The UK Independence Party seeks to remove obstacles to learning, to give real opportunities to every pupil and promote excellence rather than mediocrity. That means a return to more traditional methods of teaching the basic skills of reading, writing and arithmetic. It also means shifting the balance of power from educational bureaucrats towards school governors, head teachers, teachers themselves and parents.  In promoting freedom of choice, the UK Independence Party will allow state schools to select for academic ability or potential and to stream pupils, as long as they take into account social needs and give opportunities to children from less advantaged backgrounds. We believe in top quality education for all, regardless of background, race or income, and would work towards reducing class sizes, especially at junior level, where the foundations of learning should be laid. Our target is less than twenty-five pupils per class. Part of the Independence Dividend of funds released as a result of Britain's departure from the EU will be converted into an Education Dividend to pay for more teachers.  We also recognise that some children do better at single-sex schools, some parents prefer religious schools and that 'non-academic' children deserve as rewarding an education as their peers. And we envisage more specialist schools, which focus on (for example) music, sport, or technology. The UKIP will raise the status of technical education to that of academic schooling, and allow early specialisation in practical subjects. There are many people from industry, the Armed Forces and the professions with knowledge, skill and insight, who could make valuable contributions to this programme.  We do not rule out radical schemes, such as vouchers for parents to send their children to private schools, or schools outside their localities, where these meet their needs better. More generally, The UKIP seeks to break down the 'wall' between private and state schools, for we value the role of both in educating our children.  The UKIP aims for an education policy that reflects the concerns of parents, many teachers and pupils themselves, not self-proclaimed educational 'experts'. We shall therefore address such problems as boys' under-achievement (and the social problems this causes), the shortage of male teachers to act as role models, lax discipline, and the continuing under-achievement of many ethnic minority children. We note that some parents send their children to Commonwealth countries to receive a traditional 'British' education. This is a terrible indictment of our system. All British children should have the opportunity of a decent education. The UKIP will ensure that the days of levelling-down are over.  A further concern is politically slanted teaching, especially in History, English and 'Personal and Social Education'. A major cause of this problem is dogma-driven teacher training that also promotes flawed 'child-centred' and 'progressive' teaching methods. Teacher training will be restructured, with less emphasis on abstract educational theory, and more on tried and tested teaching methods. Another cause of bias is the insidious EU programme to brainwash our children, so that they grow up believing uncritically in the 'European ideal'. Brussels makes no secret of its desire to control education, and EU propaganda in schools has greatly increased. Unlike the other parties, we can promise that this will never happen in British schools.  The UKIP believes in genuine citizenship education including an understanding of British history. This includes learning to think, criticise and argue as well as obey the law. Citizenship is not about promoting fashionable 'isms' or lifestyles, but about independence of mind, responsible behaviour and 'life skills' such as managing money, understanding road safety and practical care for the environment. Many schools already do an excellent job in this respect.  Finally, the UKIP will stop the sale of playing fields. We regard sporting activity as an essential part of good schooling. The long-term educational and social benefit of sport in schools should not be sacrificed for short-term profit. We deplore the decline of competitive sports and other outdoor activities in schools, and will take appropriate measures to reverse this trend.  With more choice and responsibility returned to governors, teachers and parents, the UKIP is confident that motivation and classroom discipline will improve, educational standards will rise, and teachers will regain the respect that their profession deserves.  Higher and Further Education  The above principles apply, by and large, to higher education. Investment in higher education is essential to the health of the economy, not only in the creation of a well-trained workforce equipped with modern skills, but also in promoting study for its own sake, based on objective inquiry and freedom of thought.  But as with schools, there has been an increase in centralised bureaucratic interference in the running of our colleges and universities. As in so many spheres, the government has become more involved in inspection, by means of centralised teaching quality assessments and the introduction of crass new management structures. The UKIP believes that these measures are counterproductive. Decisions about teaching methods, course structures and quality should as far as possible be left to the institutions concerned. The best way to ensure standards is to leave institutions free to compete in offering courses that students and employers find valuable.  The UKIP also believes that advanced education in all its forms should be widely available. In this regard we recognise that many mature men and women want to learn new skills in order to increase their employment options. We therefore support a further education system that responds to a range of needs and offers a wide variety of courses and opportunities. We shall promote community colleges and, as with schools, we shall raise the status of technical education to that of academic study.  With regard to financing, we support those universities that seek additional financing from sources other than government, and shall explore various mechanisms for independent funding, such as transferable loans which students repay directly to the academic institutions of their choice. The UKIP will also encourage the setting up of private universities and colleges, with generous provision for scholarships for bright students from less advantaged backgrounds.  The UKIP is alarmed that several hundred university positions in Britain are funded or supported by the EU, with the provision that the individuals engage themselves in teaching or research into European integration. This will cease when Britain leaves the EU. Another advantage of leaving the EU will be that it ends the discriminatory practice in which a student from the EU pays much lower fees than one from the Commonwealth and other non-EU countries. Students from all overseas countries play a valuable role in fostering friendship and promoting international co-operation.  Higher education in all its forms must remain available to all, regardless of background and income. And the UKIP believes that the way to maintain standards and do justice to students is to leave the various universities and colleges free to offer courses that offer the best value, measured in terms of future job prospects and the advancement of knowledge.   Transport and The Environment  Transport  Propagandists for the EU present it as 'environmentally friendly'. They would have us believe that without help from Brussels we cannot address environmental problems or provide good public transport. In reality, the EU is part of the problem. It aims to impose a system of central planning where 'one size fits all' - but in reality no one is satisfied. Some of the most controversial aspects of rail privatisation, such as the creation of Railtrack as a private monopoly, were introduced to comply with EU rules - yet in many EU countries the railways are still owned by the state. EU membership drains away money that could be used to create better roads and railways. Independence will enable us to address the UK's unique transport problems instead of following irrelevant directives.  In rural areas especially, we must assume that the car will continue to be the main form of private transport, for reasons of efficiency and convenience. We are not in favour of laws and taxes which penalise the motorist - they are both ineffective and highly illiberal. There is no point in telling motorists to 'get out of their cars' when public transport is unavailable or unsafe. The UKIP supports an integrated transport system with easy transitions between car, bus or train, and in which cycling and walking are also encouraged. In improving our public transport, we can learn lessons from other countries, including the Netherlands, and Switzerland - which despite its mountainous terrain has the best transport infrastructure in Europe.  In general, the UKIP favours free market solutions in transport. However unlike the Conservative Party we do not see privatisation as an article of faith, and we oppose the partial sell-off of the London Underground. We address transport policy on a case-by-case basis, taking local conditions into account. For example, the UKIP will work with the Countryside Alliance and other rural forums to tackle the problems of rural transport - in particular for children, the elderly and people on low incomes.  The UKIP is persuaded by calls from the Federation of Small Business to reduce fuel tax, and a part of the Independence Dividend of funds released to the Treasury when Britain leaves the EU is earmarked for this purpose. High fuel taxes do not protect the environment but do threaten Britain's global competitiveness. They destroy jobs, ruin businesses and add to the difficulties of British farming. The haulage industry, rural economies and the poor are worst affected by these high taxes. Independence will mean that we could reduce our own fuel tax rates at will without having to justify this to the EU - as the Norwegian Parliament did in September 2000. The UKIP rejects the 'Climate Change Levy' as another stealth tax on business.  The UKIP supports adequate funding for bypasses, upgrading major routes, road and railway maintenance and the provision of cycle lanes. The private car Road Fund Licence (RFL) will be structured to encourage the use of the least polluting vehicles, although some historic vehicles may be exempt.  The Environment  Environmental policy is about empowerment - of local communities, businesses and individual citizens. The EU stands for the opposite: centralisation, crippling regulation, edicts by unaccountable officialdom. Recent history has shown us that centralisation has failed. The planned economies of Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union were amongst the most polluted societies on Earth. The original ecology movement believed strongly in local control. Today's 'greens' support regulation on a grand scale. Often they seem to dislike people more than they love the planet. We would like to return to the environmental movement's founding principles: respect for diversity, accessible and transparent political institutions, local accountability and human responsibility for natural resources.  The UK Independence Party supports a balance between the needs of economic growth and environmental concern. Small and medium-sized businesses have a crucial role to play in environmental policy; because they serve local communities, it is in their interests to promote a healthy environment. The EU policy of imposing cumbersome directives and issuing contestant threats has proved to be counter-productive. Like excessive taxation, this encourages illegal behaviour rather than public service. The UKIP believes that free-market solutions to environmental problems work better than state control. Yet the market must operate against a background of pragmatic and fair regulation.  As the party of decentralisation, the UKIP believes that the enforcement structure for environmental regulations should be greatly simplified. Wherever possible, enforcement will be returned to local authorities, acting under the general direction and support of central agencies which answer to Parliament. The UKIP sees a link between sound environmental management and a return to democratic accountability at all levels.  Accordingly, UKIP policy is to encourage the development of well-equipped environmental monitoring teams answerable to local authorities. A primary function of these teams will be to detect and where possible prevent adverse health effects attributable to environmental pollution. In this context, The UKIP is concerned by the alarming rise in conditions such as asthma, the emergence of significant levels of childhood leukaemia and the number of unexplained clusters of previously rare cancers. We shall promote studies to determine the causes. There will be full local involvement in such studies to prevent cover-ups by central government.  The UKIP takes a free market approach to new housing and industrial growth. Nonetheless, we are concerned about the concentration of development in the South East of England. This problem will be partially relieved by a modern, efficient communications network and transport system that will make other areas more attractive to investors. Those regions such as the South-West and North-East that currently receive EU structural funds will have this support continued from the national budget, to the extent deemed appropriate by our elected government, when Britain leaves the EU.  The UKIP takes note of public opposition to Genetically Modified Organisms (GMOs) and the failure of government to respond adequately to those concerns. This is because the British government has become subservient to the Biotech corporations and EU bureaucrats who support them. The UKIP will protect absolutely the consumer and organic farmer from genetically modified products and will enforce the clearest possible labelling giving consumers the choice of food constituents and their source. It is wrong that important issues like these are decided by the unelected European Commission. As another example, The Commission is planning a massive increase in the testing of chemicals on animals, a situation which has been condemned as unnecessary by scientists and the chemicals industry. However, the British Parliament will have no say in this decision. Only outside the EU will a free Britain be able to decide its own policy on these important issues.  Finally, turning to carbon dioxide emissions, whilst their effects on global warming remain unclear, the continuing use of fossil fuels undoubtedly impairs the long-term quality of life on our planet. We will therefore encourage and support private initiatives in developing energy production from renewable sources - biofuels, wave, wind, solar and hydrogen technologies, with the objective being that these sources should eventually provide for a substantial percentage of our energy consumption.   Home Affairs  The Judicial System  The British judicial system is under attack. The government has signalled its intention to restrict trial by jury. Our magistrate's courts are having severe difficulties coping with a rising workload and a large volume of new regulation. But these are minor issues compared with the threat to our legal system from the European Union and its determination to introduce a unified system for the whole EU.  The EU's proposed 'Corpus Juris' legal system is based on to the Napoleonic legal code that prevails in much of continental Europe, and it is very different from British tradition. Its main provisions are the establishment of a European public prosecutor, no presumption of innocence until proved guilty, and no right of habeus corpus: this means that prisoners can be held for long periods without charges being brought. In Britain it would complete the ending of trial by jury.  To complement this change, the Orwellian-sounding Europol police force has already been set up. Based in The Hague, this shadowy organisation began life with the ostensible objective of combating drugs and organised crime. Its remit has now been extended to cover political subversion - as defined by the European Commission. From next year, these Euro-police will be allowed to operate in member states at the request of the European public prosecutor, and national governments will be unable to help their own citizens. Unlike national police forces, the Europol will have diplomatic immunity - they cannot be sued by members of the public for false arrest, brutality or damage to property.  Corpus Juris and Europol are indicators of the EU's totalitarian direction. They illustrate the growing impotence of national governments against the monolithic Euro-state. For those who value freedom, they underline the need for withdrawal.  Human Rights  In modern Europe, Britain effectively invented human rights. Freedom of speech, association and religious belief, free trade unions, parliamentary reform and respect for property rights were all pioneered in Britain. We have for centuries provided safe haven for those fleeing religious, political or racial persecution, a proud tradition that has enriched our economy and society.  After World War II, British politicians worked strenuously for international guarantees of freedom and justice for all. In 1951, Britain was amongst the first signatories to the European Convention of Human Rights and was a founder member of the Council of Europe and the European Court of Human Rights. The UK Independence Party supports the principles of that Convention, because they are based on individual freedom rather than state control. But the Convention should be regarded as a series of guidelines, rather than as a binding legal code to be enforced without regard for differing national circumstances. The original aim of the Convention was to provide a flexible framework - in contrast to EU law, which is dictatorial, insensitive and dogmatic.  The UKIP supports the inclusion of the Convention of Human Rights into British domestic law. But the Human Rights Act (1999) that was supposed to achieve this is too rigid and so, ironically, it is against the spirit of the Convention. Instead of creating a culture of freedom and responsibility, it has become a pretext for politically correct interest groups to impose their will on government, society, and those they falsely claim to represent. The UKIP would therefore repeal the Human Rights Act and re-enact it to ensure that it is applied in a manner compatible with British custom and common law.  The EU's Charter of Fundamental Human Rights, that Britain has just signed, is a document of a fundamentally different kind, and it resembles more closely the constitution of the old Soviet Union.  Its aim, we are told, is to 'give Europe a soul' or prove that the EU is more than purely an economic machine. But the human rights under the Charter can be defined by the state and they take precedence over individual freedom. Freedom of speech and publication, freedom of religious organisations and freedom of private association are all at risk.  Taken to its logical conclusion, the EU's 'anti-discrimination' policy as reflected in the Charter means that a Christian school could be forced to employ atheist teachers, or a Muslim organisation to appoint Christian managers. The perverse effect of this will be to emphasise differences between sections of society and give power to self-appointed activists. The European Union favours divisive 'group' rights over individual freedom. In this connection, we note that most countries in the EU are in practice much less tolerant of racial or religious minorities than Britain. Only outside the EU will Britain be a truly inclusive society.  Although our government has insisted that the Charter is merely a consultative document, in reality it will be used as the basis for judgements by the European Court of Justice and it is the precursor to an EU Constitution. The UKIP regards this as a gross and unacceptable assault on our liberty, to which British people will never submit.  The UKIP - like the British people - believes that the state exists to protect freedom. This is quite different from the model favoured by the EU, in which rights are granted by the state and so the state can take them away. Withdrawal from the EU has become essential, as the only way to protect our common law rights and uphold our freedoms.  The UKIP sees connections between rising crime - against both people and property - and economic imbalance, family breakdown, poverty in the midst of plenty and the lack of education in responsible citizenship. We believe in addressing all these issues because job opportunities and social inclusion are the best ways to reduce anti-social behaviour. We also believe that education plays a crucial role in socialising young people. This is why we aim for an education system that meets the needs of all pupils, gives them good role models and sets an example of social responsibility.  At the same time, the UKIP regards the protection of citizens from crime as one of the principal duties of government. Crime is socially unjust - most of the victims are not the rich, but the less well off. A disproportionate number belong to ethnic minorities. The UKIP supports deterrent sentences, but we do not see the solution simply in terms of building more prisons and locking more people up. Not all custodial sentences have to involve prison. It has been shown that strong rehabilitative regimes, which involve vocational or outdoor skills, and reparations to victims, have more success in preventing young offenders in particular from re-offending. The UKIP also supports non-custodial sentences where possible, especially for 'victimless' crimes and non-violent offences. Too many are sent to jail for non-violent crimes better dealt with within the community, and too many young men are sent to adult prisons, where their needs cannot be met.  For some heinous offences, we reinforce that 'life means life'. Prisoners should not be offered early release if they still pose a danger to others - such leniency brings the law into disrepute, as evidenced by 'anti-paedophile' protests, for instance. The UKIP opposes legislation which, in certain types of offence, gives anonymity to the accuser but not the accused. This procedure contravenes natural justice, as does the rule that prisoners have to admit their guilt to be considered for parole.  The UKIP values the police both for their crime-fighting tasks and for their wider role in holding communities together. Unlike the police in many EU countries, ours are primarily public servants, and they deserve our respect for the service they provide. However we believe that this ethos of service has become tarnished in recent years by too much bureaucratic procedure, political correctness, and centralised control. Police services should be answerable to and reflect the interests of the communities they serve, and the UKIP believes that a system of County Constabularies is the best framework. We are opposed to proposals for a national Police force.  The UKIP is resolutely opposed to racism wherever it occurs. However, some of the rhetorical gestures of 'anti-racism' and 'diversity training', supposedly designed to address alleged racism in the police forces, have proved to be less than productive. A better approach is to put more police on the beat, especially in areas of high crime and social deprivation, and we support the Police Federation's call for a Royal Commission on the role and resourcing of the Police force. Part of the Independence Dividend of funds that become available on Britain's departure from the EU will be used to recruit more full-time and special constables, with the aim of reconnecting police with local communities. This will enable 'high visibility policing' with an emphasis on criminals, not motorists.  The UK Independence Party includes British people from all backgrounds and origins who are concerned about the future of their country and do not wish to be ruled by Brussels. This reflects our belief in individual freedom and equality under the rule of law. Over the centuries, those who have made Britain their home have enriched our society, our economy and our culture. But as with all prosperous countries, Britain will always be attractive to immigrants, and numbers therefore have to be limited. The attitude of the UKIP is to apply Britain's immigration rules firmly but humanely.  Unlike other parties, the UKIP believes that immigration policy should be the sole responsibility of the British government and Parliament. Withdrawal from the EU means that there will be no further moves towards a 'pan-European' immigration policy. That means, in turn, that we could accept skilled immigrants, many of them from countries with closer historical ties to Britain than the EU. The experiences of Canada and Australia have shown the benefits of admitting immigrants on the basis of skill and experience, not national or ethnic origin.  This does not mean, of course, that we advocate 'relying' on immigration to make up skill shortages. The UKIP is strongly committed to educating, training and promoting a skilled workforce of British people from all sections of British society, as is set out in our education policy.  The UKIP will also redress the injustice that EU 'nationals' can bring their families to Britain automatically, whilst Commonwealth immigrants have to wait years to unify theirs. The UKIP supports an inclusive concept of British nationality, with common citizenship and shared values.  Asylum  The UKIP insists that the processing of asylum applications must be speeded up. We approve of the current arrangement in which asylum seekers are detained in reception centres whilst their cases are considered. However asylum applicants must be closely monitored during the application process. The current system, which affords the opportunity to 'disappear' makes a mockery of the law and helps to make Britain a popular destination. This opportunity is probably the biggest single cause of the current scale of Britain's problems with asylum seekers. It also creates new social problems in which illegal workers are vulnerable to exploitation and compete unfairly with our own least well off citizens.  Britons of all origins favour a firm but fair asylum policy. The failure to process asylum applications rigorously is profoundly illiberal, and it fuels racial conflict.  Lax enforcement of policies is unjust to genuine refugees and to the wider public. It rewards criminality and punishes law-abiding behaviour. Rigorous but just asylum laws are essential to preserve a free and tolerant society, and an atmosphere of trust.  Freedom from the EU will allow us to give precedence to those refugees who have come to Britain as a first port of call, rather than first claiming asylum in another EU country, such as France or Italy. The 1951 Convention on the Status of Refugees is seriously outdated; outside the EU, an independent Britain could press for its reform.   Agriculture & Fisheries  A Special Case  The UK Independence Party believes that the unprecedented crisis in agriculture is largely due to the inherent failures of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP). Indeed, the CAP even limits our own government's ability to provide financial relief to farmers who are currently suffering such severe distress. But despite repeated promises by successive UK governments, there will never be any meaningful reform of the CAP because it serves the interests of other EU nations. When Britain leaves the EU, we shall at last be free from the CAP and able to choose our own policies, with the aim of restoring agriculture as a vibrant and diverse sector of the economy.  Although the UKIP is committed to free-market principles, we recognise that agriculture is a special case. Our agricultural industry cannot prosper without subsidy, nor can it survive if it is exposed to unrestricted global competition. The control of agricultural imports is also desirable as a health measure. Questions about our open attitude to imports are naturally being raised as a result of the devastating outbreak of foot and mouth disease. But, again, the proper implementation of appropriate measures will only be possible once Britain is free from the EU.  Special treatment is also required for the countryside. The British countryside is not just a machine for producing food and other essentials. It is not even an 'industry'. It is part of our national heritage to be enjoyed by all and its preservation requires national support.  But before any longer-term strategies are developed, an immediate injection of financial support is required, specifically targeted on areas of most need, to halt the drift from the land, farming bankruptcies, and the growing level of hardship in rural areas.  Land management contracts  In addition to accommodating the needs of the countryside, and those who work in it, any payment scheme to farmers has to change the fundamental basis of agricultural support. The farmer must not be seen as the beneficiary of 'handouts' but must become a valued contractor providing services which the taxpayer wants and is prepared to pay for. To meet this requirement, the UKIP proposes a voluntary scheme which we have called the Land Management Contract Scheme (LMCS).  The basis of this scheme is that individual farmers would be invited to draw up specific contracts in respect of their farms, in which the style of land use and management would be agreed. This would include such parameters as crops grown, methods of cultivation, employment levels, animal stocking density and types of husbandry, pesticide and herbicide usage, public access, wildlife conservation and similar factors.  Support would be calculated on the basis of the notional income which would be generated by a highly intensive farm - where production efficiency was the only criterion. Payments would reimburse farmers for notional losses arising from compliance with contract conditions.  By this means, socially and environmentally desirable practices - including forestry - would be rewarded, without farmers suffering a loss of income.  Despite such provisions, there will be farms in remote or 'less favoured' areas (such as hill farms) which will not be competitive or provide an adequate living. In these circumstances, where there is a social benefit in maintaining agricultural activity - such as the maintenance of rural employment, landscape maintenance, wildlife conservation, etc. - additional support should be provided. The UKIP would favour channelling this additional support through an extension of the LMCS, thus encouraging farmers to deliver specific services in exchange for the payments made.  The UKIP would like to see more farmers converting to the organic system of agriculture. We are also concerned at the inability of UK producers to satisfy the growing demand for organic produce - and our increasing reliance on imported produce, much of which could readily be grown in this country. Support provisions will be accommodated in our LMCS.  Similarly, there should be recognition for farmers developing and converting to 'welfare friendly' methods of animal husbandry. Freedom from the EU will mean that Britain can maintain and improve upon its standards of animal welfare, without being dragged down to a 'European' mean. We oppose EU plans to 'harmonise' animal welfare legislation and so relax restrictions on cosmetic testing, guidelines on medical or scientific testing (vivisection) and the long-distance live transport of animals. The UKIP regards such indifference to animal cruelty as evidence of the inhuman and authoritarian nature of the EU project.  The UKIP believes that young people with suitable qualifications should be given special assistance to equip their own farms, through the medium of 'soft' loans. Landlords should be afforded tax breaks to let farms to suitable young applicants. We would also like to see a special hardship fund set up to buy out elderly farmers so that farms can be released onto the market intact, and thus made available to young farmers.  Text of full Agricultural Policy  Marketing and Rural Development  The UKIP supports the development of farmers' markets, with buildings and public car parking provided by local authorities. There should also be special support for farming co-operatives. To ensure fair competition between farmer's retail enterprises, small shops and supermarkets, we believe that local taxation should be equalised, with uniform business rate levied on shelf space used for sales, rather than on trading area.  The UKIP will support new retail development if there are benefits to town centre renewal. However, we favour a more liberal approach to planning and regulation of farming enterprises. Farms should be free from unnecessary restrictions which limit diversification. They should be allowed to set up farm shops selling a wide range of goods instead of being limited to what is produced on the farm. We would also like to see farmers permitted to diversify more easily into non-agricultural enterprises, where their environmental impact is minimal or well-contained.  The UKIP deplores the attack on country sports by illiberal politicians and pressure groups, and will uphold the traditional liberties of country people whilst treating this as a matter of personal conscience. We support access to the countryside for walkers and the preservation of traditional rights of way. However we believe that an unrestricted 'right to roam' is ecologically damaging and imposes intolerable stresses on small farmers, especially in less favoured areas. Accordingly, we shall amend the Countryside and Rights of Way Act to take account of local conditions.  Freedom from the dead hand of the EU will not solve the whole of agriculture's problems. It is the start of a wider cultural change, in which rural policy is brought from the fringes to the centre of government. To enable this process to take place, the current Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Fisheries should be replaced by a Department of Agriculture and Rural Affairs, which would act as a champion for rural communities.  Fisheries  Whilst Britain remains in the EU, it remains entrenched in the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP). The CFP promotes the immoral waste of our fishery resources and forces fishermen to throw back, dead, more fish than are landed for consumption. As such the CFP represents the most illogical, grotesque and wasteful use of one of Britain's most valuable natural resources. It sums up, as a single policy, most facets of what is wrong with the EU and the centralised, remote form of administration that it seeks to impose in all areas of our national life.  The EU seeks even more control over British fishing grounds, depriving our fishing communities still further of this unique resource. And it proposes absolute central control which will reduce Britain's quotas still further, whilst allowing other EU members a greater share of our fishing grounds.  Only by withdrawal from the EU can our fishing grounds be protected and the stocks effectively managed. Fishing stocks, particularly North Sea cod, are on the point of permanent extinction. The UKIP proposes 'fishing-free' zones to allow sustainable stocks to recover, and the prohibition of certain fishing methods that are environmentally damaging and unsustainable. We will draw upon the experience and success of Norway in its management of its fishing grounds. A sustainable fisheries policy will be developed in close co-operation with our fishing communities and fisheries experts, with the primary basis being one of exclusive fishing rights allowed to the British industry (up to 200 miles) under International Law. Access by EU members and other countries will be granted by bilateral agreement.   Defence and Foreign Affairs  The UK Independence Party supports a strong, effective defence policy for a free and independent nation. This means ensuring that our Armed Forces are properly funded and adequately equipped. Successive UK governments have allowed defence spending to be repeatedly cut, with damaging effects on morale and the predictable result that the ability of our forces to fulfil even their limited current commitments is severely compromised. It is UKIP policy that a portion of the funds that become available on leaving the EU will be used to regenerate all three arms of Britain's defence forces, both in terms of personnel and equipment.  Withdrawal from the EU will mean that our defence procurement policy is no longer dictated by a commitment to EU integration. This will free us from the closed, inefficient system that gave us the Tornado (the F3 version of which had to be excluded from front line combat zones in the Gulf War), the Merlin (at £100M per airframe the most expensive helicopter on record) and the Eurofighter (£60M per airframe), which is five years late and three generations behind technology leaders. Freed from these EU projects, we shall be able to purchase equivalent technology from the US at far lower cost, or buy into hi-tech US enterprises which would greatly enhance our military capability.  On leaving the EU we shall also withdraw from the 'Rapid Reaction Force'. This is, as Commission President Prodi has made clear, an embryonic European Army for a European superstate, under the command of Brussels. As such it will not 'defend' us but threaten our independence. A self-governing Britain will work constructively with allies in North America, Europe and elsewhere, to the extent that this is in British interests. We are not isolationists, but nor do we envisage ourselves as 'world policemen'. British forces have a valuable peacekeeping role, but only in areas of strategic concern or historical ties to Britain. We see NATO as the cornerstone of Britain's defence policy, in particular because it underpins our continuing voluntary military co-operation with the United States. We are concerned that, despite denials by our government, the integrity of NATO is being threatened by the EU's new defence arrangements.  The maintenance of an effective force requires different attitudes between military and civilian life, as is reflected in military law and recruitment. For instance, it is obvious that civilian sex and disability discrimination laws cannot be applied without qualification in the armed forces. The UKIP believes that the effectiveness of our armed forces is nonetheless being undermined by bureaucratic and politically correct management, and we shall strenuously resist this development. We shall, however, encourage recruitment from minority groups and the equal treatment of all military personnel, regardless of background. The UKIP will also seek to reverse the decline in the Reserve Forces and Cadet Corps in schools and local communities.  The aim of the UKIP's foreign policy will be to co-operate with other nations insofar as this is in Britain's interests, and to foster free trade. We shall reform overseas development policy: foreign aid should be handed to local communities themselves rather than governments or bureaucratic agencies. Aid will be conditional on decent standards of individual freedom and fiscal honesty, but we shall not use it as a weapon to destroy traditional ways of life. Such considerations will also be applied to the remission of international debt.  As discussed previously under Home Affairs, the UKIP supports the Council of Europe's original objectives as a positive alternative to the EU. This is because they are based on voluntary co-operation rather than the surrender of national sovereignty. Moreover they encompass the whole European continent, not just a privileged portion of it.  Continued membership of the European Union will increasingly diminish Britain's voice in international affairs, as more power is ceded to EU institutions. An independent Britain, by contrast, can be a major player on the world stage. Friendship with the United States and our role in the Commonwealth link us directly with more than a quarter of the world's peoples, and some of the richest and fastest-growing economies. Freed from the EU, we can use our influence to promote freedom, tolerance and fair trade.  Our opponents call us 'little Englanders'. We say that they are frightened of the world.   The Constitution  The UK Independence Party supports the principles and values of the British political system: constitutional monarchy; parliamentary government; common law and the Union. The British constitution has great flexibility and a proud tradition of democratic reform. It has adapted well to changing social conditions, providing stability, continuity and an underlying sense of freedom. There have been no revolutions in Britain since 1688 and no extremist movement - right or left - has ever gained mass support. Our history and our political system vary markedly from those of continental Europe. We aim to preserve and build upon our best political traditions, but we can only do this as an independent and free people.  The UKIP opposes moves to abolish the British constitution and replace it with rigid EU law. We oppose attempts to balkanise our country into 'regions' answerable largely to Brussels. And we deplore the gradual loss of parliamentary authority under both Tory and New Labour regimes. To shore up our constitutional tradition, and protect it from future attacks, we believe that a few key reforms are needed.  First, the UKIP supports a new Bill of Rights for the United Kingdom. This will prevent at any time in the future any treaty that vests national sovereignty in an agency other than Parliament and the Crown. This Bill of Rights would be a Magna Carta for the twenty-first century, guaranteeing our independence and securing our democratic freedoms.  Secondly, the UKIP seeks to redress the balance of power in favour of Parliament - and away from an over-mighty Executive. We shall therefore legislate to circumscribe the government's ability to produce secondary legislation, and its reliance on Enabling Acts. The power and influence of the many unelected 'quangos' and 'task forces' is also in need of urgent review. Finally, there is a pressing need to formalise the system of Select Committees, to fund them adequately and give them statutory powers to require witnesses to attend. Equally, we need to give statutory authority, via Select Committees, to the findings of Parliamentary Ombudsmen.  The relationship between MPs and their constituents is a crucial part of the British political system. The UKIP believes that the MP's principal responsibility is to his or her constituents, not as mere party delegate. UKIP MPs would place their constituents' interests first and be prepared to think and act independently. Giving Parliament more teeth will encourage constructive criticism of government by MPs. This will keep Ministers on their toes and lead to more open government. As a matter of principle, we condemn the proposal for state funding of political parties, which gives rise to the dangerous possibility that the state can, in effect, strangle political opposition at birth by denying funding.  The UKIP believes in two-chamber government. We regret the weakening of the House of Lords through a mixture of opportunism, politics of envy and misguided reforming zeal. Already, conscientious and independent-minded peers have been replaced by 'cronies' who have nominal power but lack any moral authority.  Part of the EU myth is a decentralised 'Europe of Regions'. In effect, this means the break-up of nation states, the creation of toy-town regional assemblies in place of national parliaments, and the upward devolution of power to EU institutions lacking historical roots. In other words, regionalism is an illusion, another EU confidence trick. The UKIP seeks consensus, not divisive rivalry, between the constituent parts of the United Kingdom. The Welsh Assembly has proved unpopular and ineffective; we propose a second referendum to determine whether the current settlement has an ongoing mandate. The 'West Lothian question' remains unsolved, and the UKIP will address it as part of our ongoing restoration of parliamentary sovereignty. Likewise, we shall oppose any attempt to force on the people of Northern Ireland any constitutional change without their full and informed consent.  The EU project of a balkanised Britain has been aided by the reorganisation of local government under both Heath and Thatcher. The UKIP would return powers to local government, and repeal local government legislation that encourages secrecy and lack of accountability. The UKIP believes in restoring the county as the basis for local administration, and where possible, we shall return to pre-1974 county boundaries.  As a democratic party, we aim to widen participation in local politics. One device we favour is greater use of the referendum - when it is called for by citizens' petition. Referendum campaigns will reconnect local governments with the communities they serve and ensure that local government is properly representative. It will keep at bay both bureaucracy and politically-correct excesses. At the national level, too, all major constitutional questions should be approved by referenda, and we support the creation of an objective, impartial Referendum Commission. But the referendum must be seen as a supplement to representative government, not a substitute for it.  Above all, the UK Independence Party can promise that no EU 'constitution' or charter will be used to override British law. No other party can do that.   Summary  Leave the European Union ...  The UK Independence Party believes, along with most British people, that Britain should be ruled by our own elected parliament. Our parliament should be in charge of our laws, our taxation, our economic policies, our agricultural and fishing policies, our defence forces and our judicial system.  All these functions of government are being progressively taken over by the European Union. ""In the EU"" means government by the EU, and experience has repeatedly shown that trying to negotiate a better deal for Britain does not work. The UKIP believes in British democracy, not autocratic rule from Brussels. The only way to achieve this is for Britain to leave the EU.  ... and keep the £ _permanently_  The euro would not be good for Britain's economy. It is not designed to be. Its purpose is to promote ""ever closer union"" within Europe, as EU politicians keep telling us. The UKIP is the only party that will keep the pound _on principle_, because we believe our government must be in charge of Britain's budget and interest rate policies.  If Britain joins the euro, our interest rates will be set to suit conditions in the EU, making boom-and-bust worse in Britain. The euro would not make borrowing cheaper, nor would it reduce unemployment. Britain is the 4th largest world economy and we are thriving _outside the euro-area. We do not need to give up the £._  An independent Britain will be better off: ...  World trade and investment  Britain's trade with EU countries does NOT depend on membership of the EU's ""single market"". Norway and Switzerland do most of their trade with the EU but are not members. When Britain leaves the EU, our trade with EU countries will continue because we are one of their biggest customers. Also, release from the EU's external trade barriers will enable Britain to develop stronger trading links with countries outside the EU, like the US and the Commonwealth countries. And, far from putting off investment, a strong world-trading Britain free from EU restrictions will be an even greater magnet for foreign investment funds.  The Independence Dividend  When Britain leaves the EU, we shall stop giving £8.5 billion (and to become £11 billion) per year to the EU budget, and the UKIP estimates that at least a further £11.5 billion per year will become available to the Treasury from deregulation and a healthier economy. Our full manifesto sets out how this £20 billion ""Independence Dividend"" could be spent on pensions, agricultural assistance, run-down public services, the NHS, defence, schoolteachers and the police.  Deregulation  Leaving the EU will allow us to scrap thousands of EU directives which interfere with our lives, ruin businesses and destroy jobs, and the UKIP would pay particular attention to removing regulation from small businesses. We would also address the whole regulatory culture that has grown up in Britain, breeding more bureaucracy, enriching lawyers, and encouraging dishonesty and disrespect for authority. The taxation and benefit system needs drastic simplification and revision to restore the incentives to employment and enterprise.  Farming and Fishing  When Britain leaves the EU, we shall at last be rid of the Common Agricultural Policy, and free to design policies for farming and the countryside that suit Britain, not our EU 'partners'. Next time there is a foot-and-mouth outbreak, we can decide for ourselves how to deal with it. And out of the EU, we can re-establish control of our fishing grounds and allow our ruined fishing industry to recover.  Other policies  The UK Independence Party does not prescribe detailed policies in all areas. That will be the job of our elected UK government, which will be free to make laws that are in the interests of British voters once Britain is independent from the EU. But we do have clear views of the sort of independent Britain we want, with accountable, honest government at both national and local levels. We want government that earns respect, not contempt and suspicion.  The UKIP believes that the root of the widespread low morale and dissatisfaction with our public services is too much centralised control and bureaucratic management. Our attitude is to improve funding, and as far as possible to shift responsibility back to our schools, NHS staff, police and defence forces. We have competent and dedicated professionals in all these services. Leave them alone to get on with their jobs, free from red-tape, political-correctness, performance targets, spin-doctors, and fear of litigation.  In line with these principles, the UKIP would allow our schools to select and stream pupils to give the best opportunities for all. And besides concentrating on basic skills, an all-round education needs other activities including sports. We believe that the family, as the basic building block of society provides the best background for bringing up confident children, and we would restore tax allowances for married couples with children under 18.  There is deep concern about current levels of crime. The UKIP would find funds for more police, and free them from bureaucracy and politically-correct rules, allowing them to do their jobs effectively. And while rehabilitation must always be the objective, sentencing needs to act as an effective deterrent.  The UKIP recognises the contribution made by all immigrant groups to our culture and economy, and represents British citizens of all races and religions who want their country to be independent. However Britain cannot absorb unlimited numbers. The current problems of immigration and asylum result from inadequate enforcement of our laws, with migrants allowed by other EU countries to 'escape' into Britain. Our own government must re-establish proper border controls and apply our immigration laws humanely but firmly.  Finally, Britain needs a properly equipped, independent defence force that looks after British interests and continues to work with NATO, not as a part of the Euro-army. It is imperative that Britain retains its rightful place in world bodies like the UN and the G8, rather than being represented by the EU.  In 1999, British voters elected 3 UKIP members of the European Parliament. The UKIP is growing fast as more and more people realise that restoring Britain's independence is essential for Britain's future security, self-respect, and prosperity.

It is a plan to improve the lives of hardworking families and prepare our country for success in a fast-changing world. Our case rests on one idea more than any other - that it is the duty of government to provide opportunity and security for all in a changing world. Every chapter relates back to that goal: breaking down the barriers that stop people fulfilling their talent, extending opportunity to every corner of the United Kingdom, building communities strong and safe for those who play by the rules. On the firm foundations we have laid since 1997, our programme will embed a new progressive consensus in our country. This preface is my personal message.  Eight years ago, I offered new leadership - fresh, idealistic, energetic, but untested. You voted for change and gave me the chance to serve. In our first term we banished the demons of ten per cent interest rates, mass unemployment, wages of £1. 50 an hour, and outside toilets in our schools. We put Labour values into action. And we banished Labour demons too: we showed we could run the economy well, cut crime, and stand up for Britain abroad. We proved our competence.  Four years ago, I said we needed to continue the modernisation of our economy, coupled with investment and reform to achieve change in public services. At the end of this second term we have delivered an unprecedented period of stability and growth, we have increased investment and we have embarked on a radical programme of reform to put the people themselves in the driving seat of our public services. We have made difficult decisions - about health policy, student finance, and secondary school reform. In the process we have proved our resilience. Now we go to the people not only having delivered on our promises, but also setting new and more ambitious goals for our public services and our country.  But Britain can be better still.  I know the change is possible. Not just because I have studied the statistics, but because I have seen it with my own eyes, across the length and breadth of the United Kingdom.  I have spoken to NHS staff in Coventry, Edinburgh and Swansea, who tell me how their new hospital and the new funding is letting them improve care for their patients.  I have heard teachers in Bexley, Middlesbrough and Sheffield tell me how they no longer have to work in crumbling classrooms without  Preface Tony Blair  books and computers - and pupils show me, with pride, round their sparkling new school.  I have met youngsters in Blackpool and London whose lives have been transformed by the New Deal - once written off, they are now full of confidence and ambition.  I've been to communities in Southampton and Darlington where the Sure Start programme is helping overcome disadvantage and seen for myself the remarkable revival of our great cities.  I have met aid workers in Africa who tell me how this country is improving the lives of the poorest on our planet.  These are not the fantasy of politicians. They are the stories of real life in our country and abroad. Not for everyone. Not everywhere. But for enough people and in enough places for us to know it is not a fluke. Personal prosperity and the good society; the fruit of partnership between the British people and a government on their side.  Now we have to decide whether to go forward or back.  Britain is on the right track. We will not change direction. Neither will we rest on our laurels. Our third-term opportunity is to build on the progress we have made. That progress, first as a party then in government began with the insight that the only way to advance decent progressive values was to develop a new policy agenda. Our understanding of the world and the great changes underway in our society led us to reject the false choices of the past. This is the foundation stone of new Labour.  I believe that in our third term we can embed a new progressive consensus. One that reflects the mission of our movement, and the hopes and values of our people. And as much as the pursuit of this consensus represents an unprecedented opportunity for progressive politics, so it will be bitterly opposed by those who seek to take us back to the divisions of the past.  In our third term we will forge an even stronger bond between the goals of economic progress and social justice. No going back to fiscal irresponsibility. No going back to a Conservative government that says mass unemployment is a price worth paying. Going forward instead to an opportunity economy, spreading prosperity through high employment and welfare reform, spreading opportunity through widening access to university and training, spreading ownership through the Child Trust Fund and expanding homeownership.  In our third term we will make public services safe for a generation. No going back to one-size-fits-all monolithic services. No going back to the Tory years of cuts and privatisation. Going forward instead to services free to all, personal to each: breaking once and for all the dropout culture in education and the waiting-list culture in health, by raising investment and driving innovation through diversity of provision and power in the hands of the patient, the parent and the citizen.  In our third term we will cement a new social contract with rights matched by responsibilities. No going back to 'no such thing as society'. Going forward instead to power and resources in the hands of the law-abiding majority. A government committed both to abolishing child poverty and to putting the values of individual responsibility and duty at the very heart of policy.  In our third term we will show that our national interest can only be pursued by engaging with the world's great challenges. No going back to a Britain marginalised and weak. Going forward to a stronger country in a safer, fairer world. Leading on Africa, leading on the  Preface Tony Blair  environment, at the heart of Europe, working together to tackle terror and spread peace and justice.  We do not duck the tough choices - from independence for the Bank of England to the tax rise we made for the NHS, to the war in Iraq. We made decisions because we believed them right - not because they were destined to be popular.  But we refuse to accept false choices. The British people never wanted to choose between wealth creation and social justice. They never wanted to choose between national security and overseas aid. They never wanted to choose between equal rights and protection from crime. These are the false choices that landed us with economic decline and social division.  The British people have the capacity to make this a great country. Our ideals are undimmed: extend opportunity to all, demand responsibility from all, secure justice for all. Our policies are refreshed: never has a governing party proposed a more wide-ranging programme of change for the country. Our vision is clear: a country more equal in its opportunities, more secure in its communities, more confident in its future. It is our social contract: we help you, you help yourself;you benefit and the country benefits.  So now, I fight my last election as Leader of my party and Prime Minister of our country. My call is a passionate one: let's together make irreversible the positive changes that are happening in our country. Let's make the values of social justice and a fair deal for all the governing ideal of our country not just for some time but for all time. People freed from barriers of class, building a better future for themselves and for the country. Self-interest and national interest together.  New Labour's record:  The contract delivered Our country is changing for the better, because we fulfilled the promises of our 1997 and 2001 manifestos. Here is what has changed.  * Prosperity for all  Britain now has a stable, growing economy with the lowest inflation since the 1960s.  Since 1997, two million more people are in work, and the UK has the lowest unemployment for 30 years. Tax credits and the minimum wage are ensuring that work pays for everyone.  Because of this we are saving £5 billion a year on the costs of unemployment - that's £84 for every citizen in Britain - money that is being invested in frontline services such as schools and hospitals.  There are over one million more homeowners, saving on average nearly £4, 000 a year, thanks to the lowest mortgage rates for 40 years.  Since 1997, average incomes have increased by 19 per cent and the income of a typical family has increased by 17 per cent, with living standards rising in double digits for every part of the income spectrum.  There are 300, 000 more businesses, providing jobs and increased prosperity.  There are two million fewer children and nearly two million fewer pensioners living in absolute poverty.  * World-class public services  Investment in public services is up - an extra £1, 000 per pupil per year in real terms since 1997, and spending on the NHS has more than doubled to £69 billion. There are over 28, 000 more teachers and 105, 000 extra teaching assistants and support staff. The National Health Service now has 79, 000 more nurses and over 27, 000 more doctors. And public servants - from nurses to police officers - are better rewarded for their work.  Our ten-year-old pupils are ranked third best in the world in literacy and are the fastest improving in numeracy.  Since the introduction of free entry, visits to our national museums and galleries have risen by 75 per cent.  Deaths from heart disease are down by 27 per cent and cancer deaths are down by 12 per cent.  * A modern welfare state  Thanks to our New Deal, long-term youth unemployment has been virtually eradicated, with over half a million young people helped into work.  By October 2005, families with children will be on average £1, 400 a year better off as a result of our tax and benefit measures compared to 1997.  Thanks to our reforms pensioner households are on average £1, 500 a year better off, rising to £2, 000 for the poorest third.  Maternity leave has increased to 26 weeks and maternity pay has almost doubled.  There are 1. 2 million more older people in employment. The employment rate for people aged between 50 and pension age has increased by over five percentage points to 70 per cent.  * Strong and safe communities  Crime has fallen by 30 per cent overall, with almost five million fewer crimes a year than in 1997.  New Labour's record: The contract delivered  There are record numbers of police, nearly 13, 000 more, assisted by 4, 600 new Community Support Officers.  New powers to tackle anti-social behaviour have been introduced, with nearly 4, 000 Anti-Social Behaviour Orders issued so far and nearly 66, 000 fixed penalty notices.  We have halved the time from arrest to sentencing for persistent young offenders.  More than 80 per cent of initial decisions on asylum claims are now processed in two months.  * Britain strong in the world  Britain's interests are at the heart of an enlarged European Union, with economic reform putting jobs first.  Our international aid budget for the world's poorest countries has more than doubled.  We have successfully pressed for the restarting of world trade talks which will focus on the needs of developing countries.  Our strong, effective and responsive armed forces are ensuring the defence of Britain's interests.  We introduced greenhouse-gas trading to cut pollution - the first country to do so - reducing emissions by 9. 8 million tonnes in the first two years.  Chapter 1  Economy: Rising prosperity in  an opportunity society  Forward to increased prosperity, not back to boom and bust  Britain forward not back  1979-1997: Interest rates average over ten per cent  1997-2005: Britain, the fourth largest economy in the world, with the longest ever period of continuous growth  2010: Full employment in every region and nation  Britain forward not back  Labour's economic record is unprecedented - the highest employment ever, longest period of uninterrupted growth in modern history, lowest sustained interest and inflation rates for a generation. Our economic policies will build on the platform of stability and growth in three ways: entrenching a lowdebt/high-employment economy which generates investment in public services; supporting enterprise and wealth creation by making Britain the best place to do business; and helping every part of Britain and every person in Britain to contribute to and gain from the strength of our economy. And as we work globally to tackle climate change we recognise the challenge and the opportunity of achieving sustainable development at home.  * The new Labour case  Our economic record has finally laid to rest the view that Labour could not be trusted with the economy. We are winning the argument that economic dynamism and social justice must go hand in hand. In the future the countries that do best will be those with a shared purpose about the long-term changes and investments they need to make - and have the determination to equip their people for that future. So, we approach new challenges with a progressive strategy for growth. In our third term we will build new ladders of social mobility and advancement on the firm foundations of stability, investment and growth.  * Low debt and high employment  In the last eight years we have pioneered a British way to economic stability. Our economy has grown in every quarter with this Government. Interest rates have averaged 5. 3 per cent since 1997, saving mortgage payers on average nearly £4, 000 per year compared to the Tory years.  Only with Labour, which constructed this framework, will this continue. We will maintain our inflation target at two per cent. We will continue to meet our fiscal rules: over the economic cycle, we will borrow only to invest, and keep net debt at a stable and prudent level.  * Public spending and taxation  The longest period of uninterrupted economic growth in modern times has enabled the Government to deliver the longest period of sustained investment in public services for a generation. Social security bills for unemployment have been halved since 1997, saving £5 billion a year, and we are also saving £4 billion a year on debt interest payments. Over the ten-year period 1997-98 to 2007-08, real-terms investment per year in education will have risen by 4. 8 per cent and in health by 6. 5 per cent.  'We are winning the argument t economic dynamism and social justice must go hand in hand. '  Every pound we invest goes further because of our drive for efficiency and reform. Labour will complete the implementation of Sir Peter Gershon's recommendations to improve public-service efficiency and root out waste, liberating over £21 billion for investment in frontline services.  Labour believes tax policy should continue to be governed by the health of the public finances, the requirement for public investment and the needs of families, business and the environment.  We will not raise the basic or top rates of income tax in the next Parliament. We renew our pledge not to extend VAT to food, children's clothes, books, newspapers and public transport fares. We will continue to make targeted tax cuts for families and to support work. As a result of personal tax and benefit measures introduced since 1997, by October 2005 families with children will be on average £1, 400 a year better off in real terms. Living standards in Britain have been rising, on average, by 2. 5 per cent per year since 1997 - a total increase of nearly 20 per cent.  We want a tax regime that supports British business. That is why we have cut corporation tax to its lowest ever level, introduced the best regime of capital gains tax in any industrialised country, and introduced a new Research and Development tax credit.  * Full employment  Our goal is employment opportunity for all - the modern definition of full employment. Britain has more people in work than ever before, with the highest employment rate in the G7. Our long-term aim is to raise the employment rate to 80 per cent. And, as we move more people from welfare to work, the savings on unemployment benefits will go towards investing more in education.  We will make work pay. With Labour's tax credits a family with two children pays no net tax until their earnings reach £21, 000.  We will implement the recommendations of the Low Pay Commission to raise the minimum wage to £5. 05 from October 2005 and £5. 35 from October 2006.  The New Deals and the creation of JobCentre Plus have made a major contribution to cutting unemployment. The active welfare state created since 1997 is working.  'In our third term we  will build new ladders  of social mobility and  advancement on the firm  foundations of stability,  investment and growth. '  The Tories trebled the number on incapacity benefits. We will help people who can work into rehabilitation and eventually into employment, recognising the practical assistance to disabled people of the Access to Work scheme. We will build on the successful Pathways to Work programme and reform Incapacity Benefit, with the main elements of the new benefit regime in place from 2008. The majority of claimants with more manageable conditions will be required to engage in both work-focused interviews and in activity to help them prepare for a return to work. Those with the most severe conditions will also be encouraged to engage in activity and should receive more money than now. We will continue to welcome new independent and voluntary sector partners to provide job-seeking services.  * Supporting enterprise  Government does not create wealth but it must support the wealth creators. That is why our priorities are the national infrastructure of skills, science, regulation and planning, and transport. The economy of the future will be based on knowledge, innovation and creativity. That applies both to manufacturing and services.  In a fast changing global economy, government cannot postpone or prevent change. The modern role for government - the case for a modern employment and skills policy - is to equip people to succeed, to be on their side, helping them become more skilled, adaptable and flexible for the job ahead rather than the old Tory way of walking away leaving people unaided to face change.  Successful manufacturing industries are vital to our future prosperity. The Labour Government backs manufacturing: from launch investment for Airbus A380 Super Jumbo to the successful Manufacturing Advisory Service helping 13, 000 of our smaller manufacturing businesses in its first year. In a third term we will continue to do so.  Public procurement is a big opportunity for business in Britain and  the source of many jobs. We will promote a public procurement strategy that safeguards UK jobs and skills, under EU rules, to ensure that British industry can compete fairly with the rest of Europe.  Britain has some of the strongest capital markets in the world. We are determined they - and our financial services industry - should prosper. We will ensure that companies have the right framework of corporate governance and relationships with the institutions that invest our pension funds and savings in them.  * Skills at work  Our reforms to 14-19 education (see chapter 2) will raise the quality and quantity of apprenticeships and vocational education. We are now putting in place a comprehensive and ambitious strategy to help everyone get on at work:  * All adults to get free access to basic skills in literacy, language and numeracy. * A new national programme, working with employers, to ensure that  employees who did not reach GCSE standard (level 2) at school will get  time off for free training up to level 2.  * A new partnership between government and employers to fund workplace training at level 3 (technician level)  * A genuinely employer-driven training system - in every sector there will be a Sector Skills Council determining the training strategy and a leading edge Skills Academy.  * A nationwide system of advice - bringing together support on skills, jobs and careers - helping people to get on at work.  * A strong partnership with trade unions to boost workplace training including a new TUC Academy and continued support for Union Learning Reps.  * Supporting science  The alliance of scientific research and business creativity is key to our continued prosperity.  Economy: Rising prosperity in an opportunity society  Looking ahead, we are committed to a ten-year strategy on science and innovation that will continue to invest in our science and industrial base at least in line with trend GDP. Our ambition now is to raise the UK's total private and public sector investment in research and development, as a proportion of national income, from its current 1. 9 per cent to 2. 5 per cent by 2014.  Our pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries are world leaders. We have created one of the world's best environments for stem-cell research. We have now passed legislation to protect our researchers from the activities of animal rights extremists.  Across a range of environmental issues - from soil erosion to the depletion of marine resources, from water scarcity to air pollution - it is clear now not just that economic activity is their cause but that these problems in themselves threaten future economic activity and growth. We will continue to work with the environmental goods and services sector - which is already worth £25 billion to the economy to promote new green technologies and industries in the UK and internationally, and use the purchasing power of government to support environmental improvement.  * Competition, planning and regulation  Competition is a driving force for innovation. Our competition regime has been toughened with independent competition bodies and stronger penalties.  To the benefit of business and household consumers we are liberalising the postal services market, while protecting the universal service at a uniform tariff.  As we said in our policy document Britain iis orkkn, we have given the Royal Mail greater commercial freedom and have no plans to privatise it. Our ambition is to see a publicly owned Royal Mail fully restored to good health, providing customers with an excellent service and its employees with rewarding employment. We will review the impact on the Royal Mail of market liberalisation, which is being progressively introduced under the Postal Services Act 2000 and which allows alternative carriers to the Royal Mail to offer postal services.  We have reformed our energy markets to make them open and competitive. And we are a leading force in the campaign to make Europe's energy markets the same. Our wider energy policy has created a framework that places the challenge of climate change - as well as the need to achieve security of supply - at the heart of our energy policy. We have a major programme to promote renewable energy, as part of a strategy of having a mix of energy sources from nuclear power stations to clean coal to micro-generators.  We will only regulate where necessary and will set exacting targets for reducing the costs of administering regulations. We will rationalise business inspections. The merger of the Inland Revenue and Customs and Excise will cut the administrative costs of tax compliance for small businesses.  We will take further action in Europe to ensure that EU regulations are proportionate and better designed. We strongly support the creation of an EU single market in services to match the single market in goods - and want an effective directive to provide real benefits to consumers and new opportunities to British business. We will protect our employment standards. In developing the directive we will want to avoid any undermining of our regulatory framework.  We will continue to work to protect the rights of consumers, bringing forward proposals to strengthen and streamline consumer advocacy. We look forward to action from the banking industry to remove delays  Economy: Rising prosperity in an opportunity society  in processing cheques and other payments and, if necessary, will legislate to ensure this early in the next Parliament.  There are many bank accounts that are lying dormant and unclaimed, often because people have forgotten about them or because the owner has died. We will work with the financial services industry to establish a common definition and a comprehensive record of unclaimed assets. We will then expect banks, over the course of the Parliament, to either reunite those assets with their owners or to channel them back into the community.  An effective planning regime protects the environment while promoting economic growth - and does so quickly and responsively. In the next term, we will ensure that our planning system continues to protect the sustainability of local and regional environments - and we will continue to develop a regime which is simpler, faster and more responsive to local and business needs including the need to create jobs and regenerate our cities.  * Fostering entrepreneurship  There are 300, 000 more businesses now than in 1997. We are tackling barriers to financing for small and growing businesses - especially enterprises in deprived areas. Through Business Links we will offer start-ups, social enterprises and small businesses access to tailored intensive support and coaching. To foster the entrepreneurs of tomorrow, by 2006 every school in the country will offer enterprise education, and every college and university should be twinned with a business champion.  * Modern transport infrastructure  An efficient transport system is vital to the country's future, to our economy and to our quality of life. We welcome the freedom that additional travel provides and support the continuing development of a  competitive and efficient freight sector. Investment, better management of road and rail, and planning ahead are vital to deal with the pressures on the system in a way that respects our environmental objectives.  We have doubled transport spending since 1997 and will increase it year on year - committing over £180 billion in public money between now and 2015 as well as private investment. The Eddington Review will work with the Government to advise on how this investment should be targeted - in particular, where transport is vital to underpin economic growth.  We are now taking charge of setting the strategy for rail to further raise the standard of service and reliability. We will examine options for increasing capacity, including a new generation of high-speed trains on intercity routes and a new life for rural branch lines as community railways. We are committed to continuing to work to develop a funding and finance solution for the Crossrail project; and will look at the feasibility and affordability of a new North-South high-speed link.  We will support light-rail improvements where they represent value for money and are part of the best integrated transport solution. To that end, we are working with cities across the country and have committed £520 million to Manchester for Metrolink. We will support the continuing upgrade of the London Underground and the extension of the East London line.  Economy: Rising prosperity in an opportunity society  Major investment is planned to expand capacity on the M1, M6 and M25. We must also manage road space better. We are examining the potential benefits of a parallel Expressway on the M6 corridor. We will introduce car-pool lanes for cars with more than one passenger on suitable roads and explore other ways to lock in the benefit of new capacity. We will complete the introduction of Traffic Management Officers to keep traffic flowing. Because of the long-term nature of transport planning, we will seek political consensus in tackling congestion, including examining the potential of moving away from the current system of motoring taxation towards a national system of road-pricing.  We will give all over-60s, and disabled people, free off-peak local bus travel and give local authorities the freedom to provide more generous schemes. We will continue to support growth in bus provision including innovation in school transport, with greater opportunity for local authorities to control their bus networks where they are demonstrating value for money and taking strong measures to tackle congestion. To facilitate improved public transport provision, we will explore giving Passenger Transport Executives greater powers over local transport.  We will continue funding local authorities and voluntary groups to make cycling and walking more attractive. We are committed to reducing child deaths and serious injuries on the road by 50 per cent, and we will continue to work to reduce dangerous driving, especially drink driving and uninsured driving. We will work with industry to make travel on public transport safer and more secure.  Government will continue to support technological innovation to reduce carbon emissions such as the hydrogen fuel-cell buses in London. We will explore the scope for further use of economic instruments as well as other measures to promote lower vehicle emissions.  We will continue to support air travel by implementing the balanced policies set out in our aviation white paper. We are committed to using the UK's 2005 presidency of the European Union to promote the inclusion of aviation in the EU's emissions trading scheme.  For shipping, our introduction of the tonnage tax has led to a trebling in size of the fleet since 1997. We want more ships to fly the British flag, to boost jobs and training, and to increase shipping and port capacity.  * Opportunity for all  We are determined to spread the benefits of enterprise to every community in the country. Every regional economy has different strengths, and Regional Development Agencies now play an essential role in regional economic development.  'Our economy has grown in every quarter under this Government. '  We have given local authorities a direct incentive to promote local business creation, allowing them to keep up to £1 billion over three years of increased rate revenues to spend on their own priorities. The Local Enterprise Growth Initiative will work through local authorities to remove barriers to enterprise in the most deprived areas of England.  In 1997, many parts of our towns and cities were suffering from deeply entrenched and multiple disadvantage. To tackle this we established a ten-year programme, the New Deal for Communities, empowering local communities - and this is already delivering improvements in education outcomes and crime reduction.  No area in our country should be excluded from the opportunity to get ahead, to benefit from improving public services, and to be secure and safe. We will maintain our commitment to tackling issues of worklessness, low skills, crime, poor environment and health in our poorest neighbourhoods.  Economy: Rising prosperity in an opportunity society  * Fairness at work  Since 1997, the Labour Government has introduced new rights for people at work and new opportunities for trade unions to represent their members. We see modern, growing trade unions as an important part of our society and economy. They provide protection and advice for employees, and we welcome the positive role they have played in developing a modern model of social partnership with business representatives. The Labour Party has agreed a set of policies for the workplace (the Warwick Agreement) and we will deliver them in full. They will be good for employees and for the economy.  We have introduced, for the first time, an entitlement for every employee to four weeks' paid holiday, and we propose to extend this by making it additional to bank holiday entitlement.  * Promoting equality at work  A strong economy draws on the talents of all. We have extended legislation to protect people from discrimination at work to cover not only gender, disability, race and ethnicity but also religion and sexual orientation and - from 2006 - age. Labour has transformed legal rights for disabled people. We will empower disabled people further by joining up services and expanding personalised budgets.  We will take further action to narrow the pay and promotion gap between men and women. The Women and Work Commission will report to the Prime Minister later this year.  We will implement the National Employment Panel's report on measures to promote employment and small business growth for ethnic and faith minorities. We will take forward the Strategy for Race Equality to ensure that we combat discrimination on the grounds of race and ethnicity across a range of services. The Equalities Review reporting to the Prime Minister in 2006 will make practical  recommendations on the priorities for tackling disadvantage and promoting equality of opportunity for all groups.  * Thriving rural areas  Since 1997, Labour has made it more difficult to close rural schools, put in £750 million to support rural post offices and introduced a 50 per cent rate relief on village shops. Through our £51 million Rural Bus Subsidy Grant we have delivered over 2, 200 new bus services in rural areas this year.  We set targets for the creation of affordable homes in rural areas, which we have now exceeded. We will explore how to ensure a proportion of all new housing development is made available and affordable to local residents and their families.  Because of our success in achieving extensive reforms in the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP), 2005 will be the first year for decades when farmers will be free to produce for the market and not simply for subsidy. We will continue to push for further reform of the CAP in the next Parliament, starting with the sugar regime.  We will continue to promote the competitiveness of the whole food sector, and assure the safety and quality of its products. We will introduce an explicit policy for schools, hospitals and government offices to consider local sourcing of fresh produce. We will continue to improve the environmental performance of agriculture, rewarding every farmer in England for environmental protection and enhancement work through our new Stewardship schemes. We will also promote biomass, bio-fuels and non-food crops. We will work to tackle diffuse water pollution through addressing impacts across water catchments without the costs falling on water customers.  Under difficult circumstances, Labour is working with the fishing  Economy: Rising prosperity in an opportunity society  industry to create a sustainable long-term future for the fishing communities of the United Kingdom. We have reformed the Common Fisheries Policy and will continue to protect the marine environment and ensure fish stocks and their exploitation are set at sustainable levels.  We will introduce the Animal Welfare Bill as soon as possible in the new Parliament.  The choice for 2010  The Conservatives are the party of high interest rates, high inflation, mass unemployment and house repossessions. Their taxand-spend promises do not add up; and they would cut £35 billion from public investment. With new Labour, Britain can seize the opportunities of globalisation, creating jobs and prosperity for people up and down the country. We can only do so if we build a clear sense of shared national economic purpose, not just around economic stability but also investment in infrastructure, skills, science and enterprise. The choice is to go forward to economic stability, rising prosperity and wider opportunities with new Labour. Or go back to the bad old days of Tory cuts, insecurity and instability.  Chapter 2  Education: More children  making the grade  Forward to personalised learning, not back to mass failure  Britain forward not back  1997: 42nd in the World Education League  2005: Third best in the world for literacy at age ten and fastest improving for maths  2010: Every 16-year-old offered school, college, training or apprenticeship  Britain forward not back  Education is still our number one priority. In our first term, we transformed recruitment, training and methods of teaching, with record results in primary schools. In our second term we have driven fundamental reform in secondary provision - more teachers and support staff, more money, specialist schools and the Academies programmes. Our plan now is to tailor our education system to individual pupil needs, with parents supporting teachers and support staff in further raising standards. That means music, art, sport and languages as well as English and maths in primary school; a good secondary school for every child, with modern buildings and excellent specialist teaching; catch-up support for all children who need it; the guarantee of a sixth-form place, apprenticeship or further education at 16; sufficient quality and quantity in higher education. At each stage we send a clear message - every child has a right to a good education, but no child has the right to disrupt the education of other children.  * The new Labour case  For generations our country has been held back by an education system that excelled for the privileged few but let down the majority. Every child can and should be able to fulfil their potential. We will achieve this by uniting our commitment to equal opportunities for all children with a reform programme which gives every child and young person, from pre-school to sixth-form or apprenticeship and beyond, the personalised package of learning and support they need. In a third term, we will entrench high expectations for every child, ensure the flexibility of provision to meet all needs and make parents true partners as we aim for the highest ever school standards.  'Our plan now is to  tailor our education  system to individual  pupil needs, with parents  supporting teachers and  support staff in further raising standards. '  * Every pupil with better teaching  There is no greater responsibility than teaching the next generation. Head teachers, teachers and support staff deserve support and respect. There are now over 28, 000 more teachers and 105, 000 more support staff than in 1997; graduate teacher applications are up 70 per cent; average salaries are up by more than 30 per cent. The remodelling of the school workforce is benefiting staff and helping to tailor provision to pupil need. We will now go further - to intensify in-service training for teachers, to widen further routes into teaching, to help more teachers and pupils get the benefit of the range of support staff now working in schools, from learning mentors to music and arts specialists. The goal is clear: every pupil with extra support in their weakest subjects and extra opportunities in their strongest.  We want to see every pupil mastering the basics. If they are not mastered by 11, there will be extra time in the secondary curriculum to get them right: schools will be judged on how pupils do in English and maths at the ages of 11, 14 and 16.  We want every pupil to be stretched, including the brightest, so we will develop extended projects at A-level, harder A-level questions to challenge the most able, and give universities the individual module marks - as well as overall grades - of A-level students.  * Every school with more money and effective leadership Since 1997, school funding has risen by £1, 000 per pupil. Education spending that was 4. 7 per cent of national income in 1997 will rise to 5. 5 per cent this year. We will continue to raise the share of national income devoted to education. And we will continue to recognise the additional needs of disadvantaged pupils. We will also ensure fundamental reform in the way the money is spent. Funding will be allocated on a multi-year timescale. There will be a dedicated national schools budget set by central government, with a guaranteed per pupil increase for every school. Heads and governors will be in control. Successful schools and colleges will have the independence to take decisions about how to deploy resources and develop their provision. Schools will work together to raise standards. New provision will be created where standards are too low or innovation is needed. Local authorities have a vital role in championing the parent interest and providing support services.  A strong, effective governing body is essential to the success of every school and governors must be given support to help them play this role. We will allow more flexibility in the structure of governing bodies, including the ability to have smaller governing bodies, of ten members or less, to streamline management while strengthening the position of parents.  * Parents as partners  Our aim for the education system is to nurture the unique talents of every child. But children and schools do best with real and effective parental engagement. Parents should have the information and support they need to encourage their children, from the first reading book to the key choices they make at 14 and 16. And parents should be central to the process of assessing school performance and driving improvement, as well as their vital role in promoting good behaviour and raising the quality of school meals (see chapter 4).  All schools should have good home-school links, building on the new school and pupil profiles. Some schools are using ICT to make contact between parents and schools easier and better for both sides. We will encourage all schools to follow suit.  Ofsted now actively seeks the views of parents when undertaking inspections. Ofsted will be given new powers to respond to parental complaints and where necessary to close failing schools or replace failing management.  Education: More children making the grade  * Enriching primary schools  International studies show that our ten-year-olds are the third highest achievers in literacy in the world and the fastest improving in maths. Three-quarters of 11-year-olds now reach high standards in reading, writing and maths. We will intensify our literacy and numeracy programme to help an extra 50, 000 pupils achieve high standards at age 11, reaching our targets of 85 per cent of pupils succeeding at the basics.  All primary school children will have access to high-quality tuition in the arts, music, sport and foreign languages. We have set aside funds for this purpose, working with head teachers to develop support programmes and modernise the school workforce.  We have abolished infant class sizes of more than 30, and almost all primary schools have gained improved facilities since 1997. We will now upgrade primary schools nationwide in a 15-year Building Schools for the Future programme, including under-fives and childcare facilities where needed. Primary schools will become the base for a massive expansion of out-of-school provision (see chapter 6).  Foundation schools operate within the local family of state schools, and are funded in the same way as others, but manage their own assets and employ their staff directly. We will allow successful primary schools, like secondary schools, to become foundation schools by a simple vote of their governing body following consultation with their parents.  * Every secondary school an independent specialist school We want all secondary schools to be independent specialist schools with a strong ethos, high-quality leadership, good discipline (including school uniforms), setting by ability and high-quality facilities as the norm.  'we will entrench high  expectations for everychild, provide the flexibility  of provision to meet all  needs and make parents  true partners as we aim for  the highest ever school  standards. '  The way to achieve this is not a return to the 11-plus or a free-for-all on admissions policies. It is to ensure that independent specialist schools tailor education to the needs, interests and aptitudes of each pupil within a fair admissions system.  There are over 2, 000 specialist schools - schools which teach the entire national curriculum and also have a centre of excellence. Their results are improving faster than those of non-specialist schools. We want every secondary school to become a specialist school and existing specialist schools will be able to take on a second specialism. Over time all specialist schools will become extended schools, with full programmes of after-school activities.  Every part of the country will benefit, over fifteen years, from the Building Schools for the Future programme. This is a once in a generation programme to equip the whole country with modern secondary education facilities, open five days a week, ten hours a day.  Good schools will be able to expand their size and also their influence - by taking over less successful schools. We will develop a system to create rights for successful schools to establish sixth-form provision where there is pupil and parent demand, extending quality and choice for local students.  Britain has a positive tradition of independent providers within the state system, including church and other faith schools. Where new educational providers can help boost standards and opportunities in a locality we will welcome them into the state system, subject to parental demand, fair funding and fair admissions.  We strongly support the new Academies movement. Seventeen of these independent non-selective schools are now open within the state system; their results are improving sharply, and 50 more are in the pipeline. Within the existing allocation of resources our aim is that at least 200 Academies will be established by 2010 in communities where  low aspirations and low performance are entrenched.  We will encourage more small schools and boarding schools as ways of helping the most disadvantaged children. We will make sure schools in deprived areas receive the resources they need. To enable all young people to enjoy the opportunities previously enjoyed by the few, we are developing a nationwide week-long summer residential programme for school students. We support partnership between the state and private sectors to bridge the unhealthy historic divide between the two.  * Good discipline  Every pupil has the right to learn without disruption;no teacher should be subject to abuse or disrespect. We have given head teachers the powers needed to maintain discipline and the highest standards of conduct. Violent behaviour, including the use of knives will not be tolerated. We are also working with schools and teacher organisations to implement a zero tolerance approach to lower-level disruption. The number of places in out-of-school units has almost doubled, and the quality of provision has been enhanced. We will give head teachers within each locality direct control of the budgets for out-of-school provision, so they can expand and improve it as needed. We will encourage more dedicated provision for disruptive and excluded pupils, including by charities and voluntary groups with expertise in this area, and no school will become a dumping ground for such pupils.  Parents have a duty to get their children to attend school. We have introduced parenting orders and fines and will continue to advocate truancy sweeps.  * Special educational needs  Children with special educational needs require appropriate resources and support from trained staff. For some this will be in mainstream  Education: More children making the grade  schools; for others, it will be in special schools. Parents should have access to the special education appropriate for their child. It is the role of local authorities to make decisions on the shape of local provision, in consultation with local parents.  * No more dropping out at 16  The historic problems of our education system at 14-plus have been an academic track that has been too narrow and a vocational offer too weak.  We are determined to raise the status and quality of vocational education. Beyond the age of 14, GCSEs and A-levels will be the foundation of the system in which high-quality vocational programmes will be available to every pupil. Designed in collaboration with employers, specialised diplomas will be established in key areas of the economy, leading to apprenticeships, to further and higher education and to jobs with training. We will review progress on the development of the 14-19 curriculum in 2008.  We will not let economic disadvantage stand in the way of young people staying in education beyond the age of 16. We have rolled out Educational Maintenance Allowances, providing lower income students with a £30-a-week staying-on allowance. We believe that everyone up to the age of 19 should be learning, so we will expand sixth-form, college and apprenticeship places, and ensure that all 16to 19-year-olds in employment get access to training.  We believe that every 16- to 19-year-old should have dedicated supervision and support, including in the further education sector. We will support sixth-form colleges and expect FE colleges to have dedicated centres for 16- to 19-year-olds.  Further education is vital to vocational lifelong learning. Achieving a transformation of FE colleges requires both our increased investment  and serious reform. Every FE college will develop a centre for vocational excellence, and we will establish new skills academies led by leading entrepreneurs and employers from the relevant skill sectors. Sir Andrew Foster's review will help shape the reform process.  * Children's Trusts  Ofsted reports show that local government is continuing to improve the vital services on which schools and families rely. Education and social services should collaborate to help youngsters, especially the most vulnerable, achieve their potential. Local government should be the champion of parents and high-quality provision, including special needs education, school transport, and other support services. We are reforming local education authorities to form Children's Trusts to provide seamless support to children and families and work in partnership with the private and voluntary sectors.  * World-class higher education, open to all  Universities are critical to Britain's future prosperity. We need a bigger, better higher education system. We are investing £1 billion more in the science base, and increasing public spending on higher education by 34 per cent in real terms. But graduates and employers must also play their part. Our funding reforms will generate £1 billion of extra funds by 2010; the abolition of up-front fees and the creation of grants will help poorer students. A quarter of the income from the new student finance system will go to bursaries for students from poorer families. The maximum annual fee paid by students will not rise above £3, 000 (uprated annually for inflation) during the next Parliament.  As school standards rise we maintain our aim for 50 per cent of young people to go on to higher education by 2010. Two-year foundation degrees in vocational disciplines have a key part to play.  PhD students are vital to universities and the nation's research base.  Education: More children making the grade  The number of PhD students in the UK has risen by nearly 10, 000 since 1997, and we are carrying through a 30 per cent increase in average PhD stipends to make doctoral research still more attractive to high-flyers.  We will incentivise all universities to raise more charitable and private funding for student bursaries and endowments.  The choice for 2010  Under their last government the Conservatives spent more on unemployment and debt interest than on education. Their priority now is to take at least £1 billion from state schools to subsidise private education for the privileged few. In addition they would allow a free-for-all in school admissions - including an extension of selection - for five- and 11-year-olds, cap the number of pupils who can succeed at GCSE and A-level, and reduce places in higher education. The choice for 2010 is forward with new Labour: pupils with quality and opportunity through the system from three to 18; parents with the confidence that where there is no improvement there will be intervention; teachers knowing that quality will be supported and rewarded; and employers with a system that gets the basics right and provides the skills that industry needs. Or back with the Tories to an education system designed to look after the few but fail the many.  Chapter 3  Crime and security:  Safe communities, secure borders Forward to neighbourhood policing, not back to rising crime  Britain forward not back  1979-1997: Recorded crime had almost doubled 2005: Almost 13, 000 more police officers  2010: A neighbourhood policing team in every community  Britain forward not back  Today, there is less chance of being a victim of crime than for more than 20 years. But our security is threatened by major organised crime; volume crimes such as burglary and car theft, often linked to drug abuse; fear of violent crime; and anti-social behaviour. Each needs a very different approach. We are giving the police and local councils the power to tackle anti-social behaviour; we will develop neighbourhood policing for every community and crack down on drug dealing and hard drug use to reduce volume crime; we are modernising our asylum and immigration system;and we will take the necessary measures to protect our country from international terrorism.  * The new Labour case  The modern world offers freedoms and opportunities unheralded a generation ago. But with new freedoms come new fears and threats to our security. Our progressive case is that to counter these threats we need strong communities built on mutual respect and the rule of law. We prize the liberty of the individual; but that means protecting the law-abiding majority from the minority who abuse the system. We believe in being tough on crime and its causes so we will expand drugs testing and treatment, and tackle the conditions - from lack of youth provision to irresponsible drinking - that foster crime and anti-social behaviour. In a third term we will make the contract of rights and responsibilities an enduring foundation of community life.  * A neighbourhood policing team for every community Overall crime as measured by the authoritative British Crime Survey is down 30 per cent - the equivalent of almost five million fewer crimes a year. Record numbers of police - almost 13, 000 more than in 1997 - working with 4, 600 new Community Support Officers (CSOs), local councils, and the Crown Prosecution Service deserve the credit. But local people want a more visible police presence and a role in  setting local police priorities. So our pledge is a neighbourhood policing team for every community. We will carry on funding the police service to enable it to continue to employ historically high numbers of police officers.  Hard-working police officers should be supported by professional and trained support staff. So a new £340 million a year fund will take CSO numbers up to 24, 000 - to work alongside the equivalent of an additional 12, 000 police officers freed up for frontline duties. And we will work with representatives of police officers and other police staff to develop a modern career framework for the whole police team.  Not all problems need a 999 response, so a single phone number staffed by police, local councils and other local services will be available across the country to deal with anti-social behaviour and other non-emergency problems.  * Empowering communities against anti-social behaviour  People want communities where the decent law-abiding majority are in charge. The experience of almost 4, 000 Anti-Social Behaviour Orders, nearly 66, 000 Penalty Notices for Disorder, and the closure of over 150 crack houses shows that communities can fight back against crime. We are ready to go further.  Parish Council wardens, like those working for local authorities, will be given the power to issue Penalty Notices for Disorder for noise, graffiti and throwing fireworks. Victims of anti-social behaviour will be able to give evidence anonymously. Local people will be able to take on 'neighbours from hell' by triggering action by councils and the police.  We have reformed housing and planning legislation to ensure that councils plan for the needs of genuine Gypsies and travellers. But with rights must go responsibilities so we have provided tough new powers  'We E are giving the police  and local councils the  power to tackle anti-social  behaviour; we will develop  neighbourhood policing for  every community'. '  for councils and the police to tackle the problem of unauthorised sites.  Excessive alcohol consumption fuels anti-social behaviour and violence. The new Licensing Act will make it easier for the police and councils to deal with pubs and clubs that cause problems. Local councils and police will be able to designate Alcohol Disorder Zones to help pay for extra policing around city centre pubs and clubs, with new powers to immediately shut down premises selling alcohol to underage drinkers, and bans from town and city centres for persistent offenders. Police will be able to exclude yobs from town centres for 24 hours when they issue a Penalty Notice for Disorder.  'We believe in being tough on crime and its causes so we will expand drugs  testing and treatment, and tackle the  conditionsthat foster crime and anti-social behaviour. '  We will continue to overhaul our youth justice system and improve Young Offender Institutions. We will make more use of intensive community programmes, including electronic tagging and tracking to deal with the most persistent young offenders, and will increase the number of parents of young offenders getting help with their children's behaviour. We will increase, by at least a half, programmes targeted at young people most at risk of offending and will expand drug-treatment services for young people.  Crime and security: Safe communities, secure borders  o Cutting crime through cutting drug dependency Communities know that crime reduction depends on drug reduction. There are now 54 per cent more drug users in treatment and new powers for the police to close crack houses and get drug dealers off our streets. We will introduce compulsory drug testing at arrest for all property and drugs offenders, beginning in high-crime areas, with compulsory treatment assessment for those who test positive. Offenders under probation supervision will be randomly drug tested to mirror what already happens to offenders in custody.  From 2006, the Serious Organised Crime Agency will bring together over 4, 000 specialist staff to tackle terrorism, drug dealers, people traffickers and other national and international organized criminals. And in consultation with local police authorities and chief constables we will re-structure police resources in order to develop strong leadership, streamline all police support services, and focus upon national and regional organised crime.  o Reducing the use of guns and knives  Dangerous weapons fuel violence. We have banned all handguns, introduced five-year minimum sentences for those caught with an unlawful firearm and raised the age limit for owning an air gun. Now we will go further. We will introduce a Violent Crime Reduction Bill to restrict the sale of replica guns, raise the age limit for buying knives to 18 and tighten the law on air guns. Head teachers will have legal rights to search pupils for knives or guns. At-risk pubs and clubs will be required to search for them and we will introduce tougher sentences for carrying replica guns, for those involved in serious knife crimes and for those convicted of assaulting workers serving the public.  o Punishing criminals, reducing offending  As court sentences have got tougher, we have built over 16, 000 more prison places than there were in 1997. The most high-risk violent offenders will now be detained in custody indefinitely and our 2003 Criminal Justice Act confirmed that life sentences must mean life for the most heinous murders. Where significant new evidence comes to light we have abolished the 'double jeopardy' rule so that serious criminals who have been unjustly acquitted can be tried again. And we will introduce much tougher penalties for those who cause death by careless driving or who kill while driving without a licence or while disqualified.  We will tackle reoffending. By 2007 every offender will be supervised after release; we will increase the use of electronic tagging; and we will test the use of compulsory lie detector tests to monitor convicted sex offenders. Our new National Offender Management Service will ensure that every offender is individually case-managed from beginning to end of their sentence, both in and out of custody - with increased effort targeted on drugs treatment, education and basic skills training to reduce reoffending. Voluntary organisations and the private sector will be offered greater opportunities to deliver offender services and we will give local people a greater say in shaping community punishment.  * Making sure crime does not pay  Those who commit crimes should not profit from them. Already we have introduced laws that enable the courts to confiscate the assets and property of drug dealers and other major criminals. We will enable the police and prosecuting authorities to keep at least half of all the criminal assets they seize to fund local crime-fighting priorities. And we will develop new proposals to ensure that criminals are not able to profit from publishing books about their crimes. In addition we will support magistrates effectively in fighting crime and improve the enforcement of court decisions - including the payment of fines.  Where a defendant fails to turn up for court without good excuse, the presumption should be that the trial and sentencing should go ahead anyway.  We will overhaul laws on fraud and the way that fraud trials are conducted to update them for the 21st century and make them quicker and more effective.  'Overall crimeis down 30 per cethe equivalent of almost five million fewer crimes a year. '  * Backing the victim  The legal system must dispense justice to the victim as well as the accused. We have invested to create a modern, self-confident prosecution service. With new powers and new technology to bring more offenders to justice more speedily and effectively. We will improve the way the courts work for victims, witnesses and jurors by:  * Building a nationwide network of witness and victim support unitsthat provide practical help.  * Expanding specialist courts to deal with domestic violence and specialist advocates to support the victims of such crime and of other serious like murder and rape.  We will extend the use of restorative justice schemes and Community Justice Centres to address the needs of victims, resolve disputes and help offenders to make recompense to victims for their crimes.  Legal aid will be reformed to better help the vulnerable. We will ensure independent regulation of the legal profession, and greater competition in the legal services market to ensure people get value for money. We will tackle the compensation culture - resisting invalid claims, but upholding people's rights.  'We prize the liberty of  the individual; but tham  eans protecting the  law-abiding majority  from the minority who  abuse the system. '  Following consultation on the draft Bill we have published, we will legislate for a new offence of corporate manslaughter.  * Migration: The facts  Over seven million people entered the UK from outside the EU in 2003: of whom 180, 000 came here to work and over 300, 000 to study, with the rest coming here as business visitors and tourists. People from overseas spent almost £12 billion in the UK, and overseas students alone are worth £5 billion a year to our economy. At a time when we have over 600, 000 vacancies in the UK job market, skilled migrants are contributing 10-15 per cent of our economy's overall growth.  Since 1997, the time taken to process an initial asylum application has been reduced from 20 months to two months in over 80 per cent of cases. The number of asylum applications has been cut by two-thirds since 2002. The backlog of claims has been cut from over 50, 000 at the end of 1996 to just over 10, 000. There are 550 UK Immigration Officers posted in France and Belgium to check passports of people boarding boats and trains, and Airline Liaison Officers and overseas entry clearance staff are helping to stop 1, 000 people a day improperly entering the UK.  * Building a strong and diverse country  For centuries Britain has been a home for people from the rest of Europe and further afield. Immigration has been good for Britain. We want to keep it that way.  Our philosophy is simple: if you are ready to work hard and there is work for you to do, then you are welcome here. We need controls that work and a crackdown on abuse to ensure that we have a robust and fair immigration system fit for the 21st century that is in the interests of Britain.  A points system for immigration  We need skilled workers. So we will establish a points system for those seeking to migrate here. More skills mean more points and more chance of being allowed to come here.  We will ensure that only skilled workers are allowed to settle long-term in the UK, with English language tests for everyone who wants to stay permanently and an end to chain migration.  Where there has been evidence of abuse from particular countries, the immigration service will be able to ask for financial bonds to guarantee that migrants return home. We will continue to improve the quality and speed of immigration and asylum decisions. Appeal rights for non-family immigration cases will be removed and we will introduce civil penalties on employers of up to £2, 000 for each illegal immigrant they employ.  Strong and secure borders  While the Tories would halve investment in our immigration services, we would invest in the latest technology to keep our borders strong and secure.  By 2008, those needing a visa to enter the UK will be fingerprinted. We will issue ID cards to all visitors planning to stay for more than three months. Over the next five years we will implement a new electronic borders system that will track visitors entering or leaving the UK.  Across the world there is a drive to increase the security of identity documents and we cannot be left behind. From next year we are introducing biometric 'ePassports'. It makes sense to provide citizens with an equally secure identity card to protect them at home from identity theft and clamp down on illegal working and fraudulent use of public services. We will introduce ID cards, including biometric data like  fingerprints, backed up by a national register and rolling out initially on a voluntary basis as people renew their passports.  o Fair rules  We can and should honour our obligations to victims of persecution without allowing abuse of the asylum system. We will:  * Fast-track all unfounded asylum seekers with electronic tagging where  necessary and more use of detention as we expand the number of dtion places available. * Remove more failed applicants. We have more than doubled the number of failed asylum seekers we remove from the UK compared to 1996. Bgerprinting every visa applicant and prosecuting those who deliberately destroy their documents we will speed up the time taken to redocument and remove people and will take action against those countries thatrefuse to cooperate. By the end of 2005, our aim is for removals of failed asylum seekers to exceed new unfounded claims.  o Tough action to combat international terrorism  We know that there are people already in the country and who seek to enter the United Kingdom who want to attack our way of life. Our liberties are prized but so is our security.  Police and other law enforcement agencies now have the powers they need to ban terrorist organisations, to clampdown on their fundraising and to hold suspects for extended questioning while charges are brought. Over 700 arrests have been made since 2001. Wherever possible, suspects should be prosecuted through the courts in the normal way. So we will introduce new laws to help catch and convict those involved in helping to plan terrorist activity or who glorify or condone acts of terror. But we also need to disrupt and prevent terrorist activity. New control orders will enable police and security agencies to keep track on those they suspect of planning terrorist outrages including  bans on who they can contact or meet, electronic tagging and curfew orders, and for those who present the highest risk, a requirement to stay permanently at home.  We will continue to improve coordination between enforcement agencies and cooperation with other countries so that every effort is made to defeat the terrorists.  The choice for 2010  Labour's goals for 2010 are clear. Overall crime down, the number of offenders brought to justice up, with a neighbourhood policing team in every community to crack down on crime and disorder and a modern criminal justice system fit for the 21st century. And to reduce threats from overseas: secure borders backed up by ID cards and a crackdown on abuse of our immigration system. The Conservative threat is equally clear. Savage cuts to our border controls, 'fantasy island' asylum policies and a return to the days of broken promises on police numbers and crime investment.  'We will introduce ID  cards, including biometricdata like fingerprints,  backed up by a nationalregister and rolling out  initially on a voluntary  basis as people renew  their passports. '  Chapter 4  Our NHS: Free to all, personal to each Forward to personalised healthcare for all of us, not back to two-tier healthcare  1997: 12-hour waits in Accident and Emergency, and waiting more than 18 months for operations  2005: Less than four hours in A&E for 97 per cent of patients. Virtually no one waiting more than nine months for an operation  2008: No one waiting more than 18 weeks from referral to treatment. No hidden waits. Free choice of hospital  Britain forward not back  The NHS is being restored to good health: more doctors, more nurses, better facilities. Waiting times are coming down and the survival rates for the biggest killers are improving. The revolution in quantity of care must be matched by a revolution in quality of care. With equal access for all and no charges for operations. That means new types of health provision, more say for patients in how, where and when they are treated, and tackling ill-health at source.  * The new Labour case  Healthcare is too precious to be left to chance, too central to life chances to be left to your wealth. Access to treatment should be based on your clinical need not on your ability to pay. This means defeating those who would dismantle the NHS. But it also means fundamentally reforming the NHS to meet new challenges - a more demanding citizenry with higher expectations, major advances in science and medical technology, changes in the composition and needs of the population.  'We promised to revive the NHS;we have. In our third term we will make the NHS safe for a generation. '  So our aim is an NHS free to all of us and personal to each of us. We will deliver through high national standards backed by sustained investment, by using new providers where they add capacity or promote innovation, and most importantly by giving more power to patients over their own treatment and over their own health.  We promised to revive the NHS; we have. In our third term we will make the NHS safe for a generation.  * New investment  NHS spending has doubled since 1997, and will triple by 2008; already we have an extra 27, 000 doctors in post or in training and 79, 000 extra nurses; over 100 new hospital building projects under way; 500, 000 more operations a year. We are proud of the dedication and commitment of NHS staff. We have widened the responsibilities of nurses and pharmacists, paramedics and porters, creating health services more convenient for patients.  Together with our organisational reforms, the investment is paying off. The maximum time that people waited for operations in 1997 was well over 18 months. Now virtually no one waits longer than nine months, and this year it will fall further to six months. For a heart operation or for cataract removal no one is waiting longer than three months; 97 per cent of people wait less than four hours in Accident and Emergency before treatment, admission or discharge. And speedier treatment saves lives. Death rates from heart disease are down by 27 per cent since 1996; from cancer by 12 per cent.  We will do even better. For too long waiting times have only counted the time after diagnosis. We will be the first Government to include all waiting times in this calculation, including waiting for outpatient appointments and for test results. There will be no hidden waits. So:  * By the end of 2008, no NHS patient will have to wait longer thana maximum of 18 weeks from the time they are referred for a hospital operation by their GP until the time they have that operation. This would  mean an average wait of nine to ten weeks.  *We will commit to faster test results for cervical smears. *We will go further in improving cancer waiting times.  'The NHS is being  restored to good health:  more doctors, more nurses,  better facilities. .  The revolution in  quantity of care mustbe matched by a revolution  in quality of care. '  All this with equal access for all, free at the point of need with no charges for hospital operations.  We have tightened the rules on NHS operations so that 'health tourists' now have to pay for treatment.  'One principle underpins our reformputting patients centre stage.  And extending patient power and choice is crucial to achieving this. '  We will deal with the challenge of MRSA. Infections acquired in hospital are not new. The time to destroy MRSA was in the early 1990s - when only five per cent of the bacteria were resistant to antibiotics. At that time the Tory government did not even keep records about the incidence of MRSA and were forcing hospitals to contract out cleaning services. We were the first government to publish statistics on the problem. Now, thanks to the tough measures we have already taken, including the end to a two-tier workforce for contracted-out cleaning services, MRSA rates are on their way down. But there is still some way to go. We all want clean hospitals, free of infection. We have already reintroduced hospital matrons and given them unprecedented powers to deal with cleanliness and infections in their wards; we shall reinforce this by consulting on new laws to enforce higher hygiene standards  And by strengthening accountability and cutting bureaucracy, we shall ensure that the new investment is not squandered. We are decreasing the numbers of staff in the Department of Health by a third, and are  Our NHS: Free to all, personal to each  halving the numbers of quangos - freeing up £500 million for frontline staff. Given the pace of change within medical services we will ensure that it is possible for the NHS to change the way in which it organises its services as quickly as possible. Further streamlining measures will allow us to release an additional £250 million a year for frontline services by 2007.  In the light of the findings of the Shipman Inquiry, we will strengthen clinical governance in the NHS to ensure that professional activity is fully accountable to patients, their families and the wider public. Following the recommendation of the Health Select Committee, we will require registration of all clinical trials and publication of their findings for all trials of medicinal products with a marketing authorisation in the UK.  * Innovation and reform  To achieve our goals we need to expand and develop different types of provision. We will put more money into the frontline, develop practice-based commissioning, and so ensure that family doctors have more power over their budgets. We will create more services in primary care. We will build on our family doctor service with more GPs delivering more advanced services more locally; new walk-in centres for commuters; specialised diagnostic and testing services; comprehensive out-of-hours services; high-street drop-in centres for chiropody, physiotherapy and check-ups. And we will continue to expand the role of nurses. These changes will result in more quality, convenience and care.  Expansion in NHS capacity will come both from within the National Health Service - where we will develop the NHS Foundation Trust model and the new freedom for GPs to expand provision - as well as from the independent and voluntary sector, where specialist services are available at NHS standards to meet NHS need.  'Healthcare is tooprecious to be left to  chance, too central to life  chances to be left to your  wealthThis meansdefeating those who would  dismantle the NHS. '  To help create an even greater range of provision and further improve convenience, we will over the next five years develop a new generation of modern NHS community hospitals. These state-of-the-art centres will provide diagnostics, day surgery and outpatients facilities closer to where people live and work.  We shall continue to encourage innovation and reform through the use of the independent sector to add capacity to, and drive contestability within, the NHS. We have already commissioned 460, 000 operations from the independent sector, which will all be delivered free - with equal access for all based on need, not the ability to pay.  Whenever NHS patients need new capacity for their healthcare, we will ensure that it is provided from whatever source.  * Empowering patients: choosing not waiting  One principle underpins our reforms - putting patients centre stage. And extending patient power and choice is crucial to achieving this. We shall be embedding both throughout the NHS. So:  * By the end of 2008, patients whose GPs refer them for an operation will be able to choose from any hospital that can provide that operation to  NHS medical and financial standards. There will be the choice of a convenient time and place for a non-urgent operation for example a location  close to relatives.  *We will expand capacity and choice in primary care too. Where GPs'lists are full we will expand provision by encouraging entrepreneurial GPs and other providers to expand into that location.  * By 2009 all women will have choice over where and how they have their baby and what pain relief to use. We want every woman to be supported by the same midwife throughout her pregnancy. Support will be linked closely to other services that will be provided in Children's Centres.  * In order to increase choices for patients with cancer we will double the  investment going into palliative care services, giving more peoplethe choice to be treated at home.  By October 2005 we will have recruited more than 1, 000 new NHS dentists and will have increased the number of dental school places by 25 per cent. We will undertake a fundamental review of the scope and resourcing of NHS dentistry.  We will provide more information and advice. Through NHS Direct, Health Direct, interactive TV, print media and the internet we will give more convenient access to much better information about health and health services, including the performance of doctors and hospitals.  * Empowering patients:  long-term conditions and social care  We will promote the integration of health and social care at local level, so that older people and those with long-term conditions can retain their independence. We will continue to provide healthcare free in long-term care establishments, and provide the right framework for schemes such as equity release which make staying at home an attractive option. We will develop our policy of community matrons for those with severe conditions, helping to keep people out of hospital by providing better care at home.  *We will develop personalised budgets in social care where people can decide for themselves what they need and how it should be provided.  *We shall extend case-management for the 18 million people with long-term conditions. We will treble the investment in the Expert Patients Programme, and help many more patients take control of their own care plans.  * Almost a third of people attending GP surgeries have mental health problems and mental health occupies approximately one third of a GP's time. So we will continue to invest in and improve our services for people with mental health problems at primary and secondary levels, including  behavioural as well as drug therapies.  *We shall provide safeguards for the few people with long-term mental  health problems who need compulsory treatment coupled with appate protection for the public. We shall also strengthen the system for pring the public from offenders who have served their sentence but maystill pose a threat because they have a serious psychopathic disorder.  * Living healthier lives  People want to take responsibility for their own health outside the NHS as well as within it. They have the right to expect help from government. The killer diseases of the heart and the many forms of cancer are often the product of poor diet, lack of exercise and above all smoking. By 2010 we aim to reduce deaths from coronary heart disease and strokes by 40 per cent from 1997. And we want death rates from cancer to be cut by 20 per cent.  * Healthy choices for children  We will start the drive for better health early - at school. We have already extended the provision of free fruit to all 4- to 6-year-olds at school. We will invest more in renovating and building new kitchens as well as investing an extra £210 million in school meals, guaranteeing that at least 50p per meal is spent on ingredients in primary schools, and at least 60p in secondary schools. We are introducing an independent School Food Trust, better training for dinner ladies and Ofsted inspection of healthy eating. We will legislate for tougher standards of nutrition for school meals and will encourage schools to teach more about healthy eating. We will ban certain products that are high in fat/salt content from school meals and ensure that fresh fruit and vegetables are part of every school meal. We will encourage secondary schools to keep pupils on the premises to ensure that they have a healthy meal. We will ensure that all school children have access to a school nurse.  * Healthy choices for all  We will put in place a simple system of labelling to make it easier for busy shoppers to see at a glance how individual foods contribute to a healthy balanced diet. We will help parents by restricting further the advertising and promotion to children of those foods and drinks that are high in fat, salt and sugar.  We recognise that many people want smoke-free environments and need regulation to help them get this. We therefore intend to shift the balance significantly in their favour. We will legislate to ensure that all enclosed public places and workplaces other than licensed premises will be smoke-free. The legislation will ensure that all restaurants will be smoke-free; all pubs and bars preparing and serving food will be smoke-free; and other pubs and bars will be free to choose whether to allow smoking or to be smoke-free. In membership clubs the members will be free to choose whether to allow smoking or to be smoke-free. However, whatever the general status, to protect employees, smoking in the bar area will be prohibited everywhere.  These restrictions will be accompanied by an expansion of NHS smoking cessation services to encourage and support smokers to improve their own health by giving up smoking  Starting with the poorest areas of the country we will introduce health trainers to help people maintain their healthy choices. By 2010, through this activity we plan to reduce the health inequalities that exist between rich and poor.  All this will be free at the point of need.  The choice for 2010  Today's Conservatives want to do what not even Margaret Thatcher would countenance - introducing charges for hospital  Our NHS: Free to all, personal to each  operations so that those who can afford to pay thousands of pounds can push ahead of those who cannot. As well as ending the founding principle of the health service, this would take more than £1 billion out of the system to subsidise those who can afford to pay. For the rest of us, the Tories would abandon waiting-list targets and allow a return to the 18-month waits that were their NHS legacy. The choice is forward with new Labour to a health system with patients in the driving seat, free to all and personal to each of us. Or back with the Tories to longer waits, and to a health system where treatment depends not on your condition but on your bank balance.  Chapter 5  Older people: Secure today, prepared for the future Forward to new opportunities in old age, not back to poverty and insecurity  Britain forward not back  1997: 2. 8 million pensioners in poverty, the poorest living on £69 per week  2005: Minimum income for pensioners of £109 per week  2010: A long-term settlement for pensions  Britain forward not back  Our priority since 1997 has been to tackle pensioner poverty. Nearly two million pensioners have been lifted out of absolute poverty as a result of Labour's measures, which are now getting on average an extra £2, 000 a year to the poorest third. Our priorities now are to build a national consensus for tomorrow's pensioners, combining public and private pension schemes to build security in retirement, and to extend the quality of life of older people.  * The new Labour case  By 2020 there will be more people over the age of 80 than under the age of five. For a progressive government there can be no compromise of our duty to today's pensioners. But while we fulfil that duty we must also see old age as a time of independence and opportunity. On pensions, our aim is a system that provides security and decency for all, which encourages and rewards saving, and is financially sustainable. And because, more than anything, people need certainty to plan for the future we will seek a national consensus - cross-party, cross-generation - for long-term reform.  * Tackling pensioner poverty:  The success of the Pension Credit  In 1997, 2. 8 million pensioners were living in poverty - with the poorest expected to live on just £69 per week. Labour's Pension Credit now means that no pensioner need live on less than £109 per week. It rewards saving and helps over three million pensioners, with women in particular benefiting. We will increase Pension Credit in line with earnings up to and including 2007-08.  'On pensions, our aim  is a system that provides  security and decency for  all, which encourages and  rewards saving, and is  financially sustainable. '  All pensioners have benefited from improved universal benefits like the state pension, the Winter Fuel Payment (now worth £300 per year for the over-80s), help with council tax and free TV licences for the over-75s. This year, all households expected to pay council tax that include anyone over 65 will receive £200 towards the cost of council tax, and the following year there will be free, off-peak local bus travel in England for the over-60s.  Millions of pensioners have benefited from our fuel poverty programme. Our goal is to eliminate fuel poverty for vulnerable groups by 2010, and for all by 2015.  * Pensions for the generation of tomorrow  The generation retiring in the future will be different in many ways from its predecessors. Their jobs will have been different; the expectations of women will be transformed;their retirements will be longer and healthier. We have begun to lay the foundations for the pensions system of tomorrow, for example, by: introducing the State Second Pension to ensure carers, low earners and disabled people have a chance to build up a decent pension for the first time; encouraging automatic enrolment into company pension schemes; creating the Pension Protection Fund;enabling pensioners for the first time to work part time and draw down their occupational pension; as well as offering an increased state pension or lump sum for those deferring their pension. We will work to increase the proportion of pension fund trustees nominated by scheme members, along with access to proper training. We will keep this issue under review, with consultation in the expectation of further progress to 50 per cent member-nominated trustees.  We need to forge a national consensus about how we move from a pension system designed for today's pension problems to one that is right for tomorrow's. We appointed the Pensions Commission to look into the future of pensions and its second report is due in autumn 2005. We are clear about the goals of a reformed system. It must tackle poverty, provide everyone with the opportunity to build an adequate retirement income, and be affordable, fair and simple to understand. In particular it must address the disadvantages faced by women.  * New rights, new choices  Many older people want to carry on working in their 50s and 60s. The welfare state should be there to help them. Older people with their skills and experience are potentially an enormous resource. That is why we set up the New Deal for the Over-50s, with over 150, 000 older people helped back to work.  We also need to put the force of the law on the side of older people who wish to continue working. Companies will no longer be able to force people to retire before the age of 65 except where specifically justified. All employees over the age of 65 will have the right to request of their employer that they be allowed to carry on working. After five years we will review whether there should be any fixed retirement ages.  'provide everyone with the opportunity to build an adequate retirement income, and be affordable, fair and simple to understand. '  We will give older people greater choice over their care. For every older person receiving care or other support, we want to offer transparent, individual budgets which bring funding for a range of services, including social care, care homes, and housing support such as adaptations, maintenance and cleaners together in one place. We will pilot individual budgets for older people by the end of this year.  We will make the most of the opportunities of an older population by creating a new programme for older people to be mentors and  Older people: Secure today, prepared for the future coaches to gifted and talented young people. We will also work with voluntary organisations to help expand grandparent and toddler groups across the country.  * Support across the generations  The challenge of balancing work and family applies to parents but also to people looking after an elderly or sick relative - now one in five adults. Since the introduction of the right to request from their employer flexible working arrangements, a million parents have changed their working hours. We are consulting on a similar right for carers of elderly or sick relatives.  The choice for 2010  The Tories are the party of pensioner poverty. When they left office in 1997, one in four pensioners was living in poverty and the poorest pensioners were expected to get by on just £69 a week. They would phase out the Pension Credit and abolish the State Second Pension, hurting most those most in need. When the one thing we all need is certainty, the Tories have admitted they have absolutely no plans for how to fund their pensions policy beyond four years. The choice is whether we go forward with new Labour with today's pensioners provided for and poverty falling, a national consensus on fair and sustainable long-term reform and the policies to give older people enhanced rights and choices. Or back with the Tories to rising levels of pensioner poverty and unending insecurity for tomorrow's pensioners.  Chapter 6  Families: Choice and support at work and at home Forward to family prosperity, not back to family poverty  Britain forward not back  1997: Childcare places for only one in eight children under eight  2005: Universal, free, part-time nursery education for all three- and four-year-olds  2010: Universal, affordable childcare for threeto 14-year-olds and a Sure Start Children's Centre in every community  Britain forward not back  It is impossible to fulfil the potential of our country - never mind promoting social mobility and equality of life chances - unless every child gets the best possible start in life. Government does not bring up children, but it must support parents in their key role. We will help parents balance work and family, expand paid leave, deliver the biggest ever expansion in childcare and end child poverty in a generation.  * The new Labour case  Strong families are the bedrock of a strong society. Children cannot be the forgotten constituency of politics; parents put their children first and they deserve support from government. Yet fear of seeming to 'nanny' has in the past meant British law and culture have not supported parents and children. Government cannot shirk its responsibilities. Our starting point is that for children to come first parents need to be given choices: a tax and benefit system to raise family incomes and tackle child poverty; legal changes to promote a healthy balance between work and family; and services built around the needs of children. Our third-term commitment - not a nanny state but a familyfriendly government.  * Tackling child poverty  We will end child poverty, starting by halving it - both in terms of relative low-income and in terms of material deprivation - by 2010-11.  Work is the best anti-poverty strategy. Tailored help, especially for lone parents, is key but we are also committed to making work pay - with a guaranteed income of at least £258 per week for those with children and in full-time work.  The benefits system needs to support all children, and those in greatest need the most. That is the rationale for universal child benefit and targeted tax credits, and why we have committed to increasing the  Child Tax Credit at least in line with earnings up to and including 2007-08. By October 2005, families with children will be on average £1, 400 per year better off, and those in the poorest fifth of the population on average £3, 200 a year better off compared to 1997. Labour's Child Trust Fund creates a nest egg for newborns that they can access at age 18. It is the world's first example of a government ensuring that all children grow up with a financial stake. We are determined to see it grow and are consulting on making payments at age seven and at secondary school age, in addition to those made at birth.  'Over 350, 000 mothers and 80, 00 fathers each year are using new rightsto paid maternity and paternity leave. '  We are supporting local authorities in the radical reform of children's services, above all to ensure there is one professional with lead responsibility for each vulnerable child. We will also ensure that services are designed to meet the additional needs of disabled children and their families.  * Universal childcare  Since 1997, the Government has funded an additional 520, 000 sustainable childcare places and now every family with a three- or four- year-old child has access to a free nursery place. By 2010, we will create 3, 500 Sure Start Children's Centres for children under five years - five in every constituency - a universal local service that brings together childcare and services for families. By 2010, all parents of three- and four-year-olds will have increased rights to flexible, free, part-time nursery provision for 15 hours a week over the whole school  Families: Choice and support at work and at home year. Over the longer term we will increase free provision to 20 hours.  For older children up to the age of 14 extended schools, working in partnership with the private and voluntary sectors, will offer affordable out-of-school childcare from 8am to 6pm throughout the year, with a range of arts, music, sport and study support.  We will help families with incomes of up to £59, 000 a year with their childcare costs through more generous Working Tax Credit, including help for those using a nanny or au pair. Parents using childcare supported by their employer will be able to get a tax break worth up to £50 a week each. We are working with the GLA and the Mayor to bring down the cost of childcare in London.  * Creating time  Over 350, 000 mothers and 80, 000 fathers each year are using new rights to paid maternity and paternity leave. Parents consistently say their top priority is more choice of whether to stay at home with their baby in the first year of its life. We will therefore increase paid maternity leave to nine months from 2007 - worth an extra £1, 400 - with the goal of achieving a year's paid leave by the end of the Parliament while simplifying the system for employers. We want to give fathers more opportunities to spend time with their children, and are consulting on how best to do this including the option of sharing paid leave. We have already introduced the right to request flexible working to parents of children under six and nearly a million parents have benefited. We need to balance the needs of parents and carers, with those of employers, especially small businesses. We are consulting on extending the right to request flexible working to carers of sick and disabled adults as a priority, and also on whether we should extend the right to parents of older children.  'Children cannot be  the forgotten constituency  of politics; parents put  their children first and  they deserve support  from government. '  * Supporting family life  Common sense, as well as research, says that children need to be able to depend on the love and support of both parents. The financial support we are giving families, along with new rights to flexible working and access to childcare, are all designed to support family life. Government can and should support those public and voluntary agencies that support families and parents. We are examining the development of a new information service - Parents Direct - to provide advice on all aspects of children's services and parental entitlements.  For those parents who do separate or divorce, both have a responsibility for a meaningful relationship with their children where that is safe. We are introducing reforms to minimise conflict and encourage conciliation by greater and early use of mediation. We stand by the principle that absent parents should make a fair contribution to the cost of the upkeep of their children, and we are committed to tackling the backlog of Child Support Agency claims as efficiently and fairly as possible. We also need to ensure court orders on access are enforced according to the best interests of the child, which ideally gives both parents an important role.  * Increasing home ownership  A decent home is crucial to family well-being. Homeownership has increased by over one million with Labour and by the end of our third term we aim for it to have risen by another million to two million. Rising house prices in many areas of the country have made it difficult for people on lower incomes to get a foot on the housing ladder. So we have raised the stamp duty threshold from £60, 000 to £120, 000 for residential properties, exempting an extra 300, 000 homebuyers from stamp duty every year.  We will continue to respond to the challenges of local housing markets across the UK. In the South we will invest in extra housing in London and the wider South East, with particular emphasis on the Thames Gateway and other growth areas. In the Midlands and North we will tackle the problems of low demand and abandonment that threaten communities.  We want to widen the opportunity to own or part-own, especially for more young people and those tenants who rent in the private or public sector. Our comprehensive plan includes:  * A new Homebuy scheme offering up to 300, 000 council and housing association tenants the opportunity to buy part of their home, increasing their equity over time if they wish.  * A First Time Buyers Initiative to help over 15, 000 first-time buyerswho could not own or part-own a home without extra help. We will use surplus public land for new homes, enabling the buyer to take out a mortgagefor only the building.  * Strengthening existing home ownership schemes, such as the Key Worker Living scheme and Shared Ownership.  * Social housing  The increased supply and quality of social housing is central to Labour's belief in mixed, sustainable communities.  Since 1997, we have cut the number of substandard social-rented homes by one million; installing 300, 000 new kitchens, 220, 000 new bathrooms and 720, 000 new boilers and central heating systems into council homes. By 2010 we will ensure that all social tenants benefit from a decent, warm home with modern facilities.  For too long, tenants have had little say over where they live. In a third term, Labour will offer greater flexibility and choice for those who rent. We will increase the annual supply of new social homes by 50 per cent by 2008, an extra 10, 000 homes a year, and give local authorities  the ability to start building homes again and bring empty homes back into use. And we will end the 'take it or leave it' approach to social renting by expanding choice-based lettings nationwide.  The choice for 2010  The Tories are all talk and no action on family policy. They opposed our increases in maternity and paternity pay and the introduction of flexible working rights. Even the measures they have proposed wouldn't come in until 2009, by which time the Tories are committed to making deep cuts in spending. The choice is forward with new Labour to a universal, affordable, good-quality childcare, a million more homeowners, more choice for all parents and an end to child poverty. Or back to the risky economic policies of a Tory government that would let families sink or swim whatever the pressures they face.  Britain forward not back  Chapter 7  International policy: A stronger country in a secure, sustainable and just world  Forward to international leadership, not back to isolation and powerlessness  1997: Marginalised in Europe, aid in decline and Bosnia in ruins  2005: Aid doubled, elections in Iraq and Afghanistan, Kosovo and Bosnia peaceful  2010: A strong Britain in a reforming Europe, 300 million out of poverty, global action on climate change  Britain forward not back  Globalisation means that events elsewhere have a direct impact at home. So we will pursue British interests by working with our allies to make the world a safer, fairer place. This means reforming Europe. It means fighting terrorism and stopping the spread of weapons of mass destruction. It means modernising our armed forces. And it means using our leading role in the G8, EU, the Commonwealth and UN to promote global action on climate change and poverty.  * The new Labour case  Domestic interests and international action are entwined more than ever before. Action on drugs, terrorism, people trafficking, AIDS, climate change, poverty, migration and trade all require us to work with other countries and through international organisations. The best defence of our security at home is the spread of liberty and justice overseas. In a third term we will secure Britain's place in the EU and at the heart of international decision-making. We will always uphold the rule of international law.  * Making Europe work better for Britain  We are proud of Britain's EU membership and of the strong position Britain has achieved within Europe. British membership of the EU brings jobs, trade and prosperity; it boosts environmental standards, social protection and international clout. Since 1997 we have gone from marginal players, often ignored, to leaders in the European Union. Working hard with Labour MEPs, we are determined to remain leaders. Outside the EU, or on its margins, we would unquestionably be weaker and more vulnerable.  The EU now has 25 members and will continue to expand. The new Constitutional Treaty ensures the new Europe can work effectively, and that Britain keeps control of key national interests like foreign policy, taxation, social security and defence. The Treaty sets out what the  EU can do and what it cannot. It strengthens the voice of national parliaments and governments in EU affairs. It is a good treaty for Britain and for the new Europe. We will put it to the British people in a referendum and campaign whole-heartedly for a 'Yes' vote to keep Britain a leading nation in Europe.  We will also work to reform Europe. During Britain's EU presidency this year, we will work to promote economic reform, bear down on regulation;make progress in the Doha development trade round;bring closer EU membership for Turkey, the Balkans and Eastern Europe; and improve the focus and quality of EU aid so it better helps the poorest countries.  We will continue to lead European defence cooperation. We will build stronger EU defence capabilities, in harmony with NATO - the cornerstone of our defence policy - without compromising our national ability to act independently. We will ensure the new EU battle groups are equipped and organised to act quickly to save lives in humanitarian crises.  On the euro, we maintain our common-sense policy. The determining factor underpinning any government decision is the national economic interest and whether the case for joining is clear and unambiguous. The five economic tests must be met before any decision to join can be made. If the Government were to recommend joining, it would be put to a vote in Parliament and a referendum of the British people.  * Protecting British interests and British citizens abroad  We will continue to provide effective support to British businesses and trade unions abroad, and we will continue to improve our ability to respond quickly to international crises and disasters which affect our citizens. The Foreign Office already provides a wide range of services for British people in difficulty overseas, and we will consult widely before drawing up a comprehensive statement spelling out the rights and responsibilities of British travellers abroad. This will include the help that people can expect from their government in times of need.  * Helping make you more secure  We have worked closely with the US and other nations to combat the threat of terrorism in Afghanistan and in Iraq. The threat of the proliferation of chemical, biological and nuclear weapons - and their use by rogue states or terrorist groups - is a pressing issue for the world today. We have worked with the US to ensure that Libya has given up its WMD, and we will continue with France and Germany to ensure that Iran does not develop nuclear weapons. In North Korea we will support the multilateral approach of the Six Parties talks. We will continue to strongly support the peace process between India and Pakistan, and back moves to resolve the long-running dispute over Kashmir. And we will work to put an end to the international network of trade in weapons of mass destruction. Labour has already introduced a strict regime to control the export of conventional weapons, and we led moves for EU-wide measures. We will work actively to secure an international treaty on the arms trade.  * Promoting human rights, peace and democracy  We need to be tough on terrorism and its causes. The threat of terrorism and the danger to British citizens is proven, not just by September 11th but by repeated attacks in Europe and around the world. So we cannot sit back and hope that we will be unaffected. It is right that we do everything in our power to disrupt terrorist networks, and to challenge the conditions that help terrorism to breed.  The UN Charter proclaims the universal principles of human rights and democracy. In an uncertain world they are not only right in principle, they are important guarantees of our national security and prosperity too.  'Domestic interests and international action are entwined more than ever before. Action on drugs, terrorism, people trafficking, AIDS, climate change, poverty, migration and trade all require us to work with other countries and through international organisations. '  There have been major strides forward in recent years: in Indonesia, Afghanistan and many parts of Africa and Latin America, democracy is being extended.  We mourn the loss of life of innocent civilians and coalition forces in the war in Iraq and the subsequent terrorism. But the butchery of Saddam is over and across Iraq, eight million people risked their lives to vote earlier this year. Many people disagreed with the action we took in Iraq. We respect and understand their views. But we should all now unite to support the fledgling democracy in Iraq. British troops should remain in Iraq under a United Nations mandate as long as the democratically elected government there wants them. They will continue to train Iraqi security forces to take responsibility for their own future.  We welcome the wider process of democratic reform across the Middle East, and we will work with our allies to encourage and promote economic and political change.  We strongly support the peace process between Israel and Palestine. Resolution of the conflict is crucial to peace in the region and the wider world. The conference held in London in March 2005 has started the process of helping a democratic government in Palestine build security and prosperity. We will work tirelessly to bring about a peace settlement in which a viable and independent state of Palestine lives alongside a safe and secure Israel.  * Supporting our armed forces  Britain's armed forces are among the best in the world. They are able to play a key role in advancing our interests and values. We want to keep it that way.  We are immensely proud of the bravery, skill and dedication our armed forces have demonstrated in Afghanistan, Iraq, Sierra Leone, the  Balkans and elsewhere across the world. They are a force for good. We will never commit forces to battle unless it is essential; but when they are committed they will have the investment, strategy, training and preparation they need. That is one reason we have given the armed forces the biggest sustained increase in funding since the end of the Cold War. But we also know that modern demands on our armed forces are changing. That is why reform and modernisation are essential. A reduction in the number of infantry battalions, made possible because of the improved security situation in Northern Ireland, has allowed extra resources for the vital support services such as signals, engineers, intelligence and logistics units - the parts of the army most under pressure. This is essential to allow our infantry soldiers to be fully supported when they go into action on our behalf. We will continue with the investment and reform that make our fighting forces the most flexible and effective in the world.  We are also committed to retaining the independent nuclear deterrent and we will continue to work, both bilaterally and through the UN, to urge states not yet party to non-proliferation treaties, notably the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, to join.  * Veterans  Labour has always recognised the sacrifice and bravery of our servicemen and women. That is why we were the first government to appoint a Minister for Veterans Affairs. This has enabled us to put veterans' affairs at the heart of decision-making at the Ministry of Defence. Labour has also put more money than ever before into veterans'issues, including £27 million of Lottery funding over the last two years. We will continue to give priority to veterans' affairs as we mark 60 years since the end of the Second World War.  * Reforming the United Nations  The UN is crucial to our efforts to build a more secure and more  International policy  prosperous world. We support the reform of the Security Council so it becomes more representative and has a stronger focus on conflict prevention. We support the recommendation of the Secretary-General's High-level Panel for a Peace-building Commission to assist countries emerging from conflict and to develop mechanisms to enhance conflict prevention. We will press for more radical reform of the UN humanitarian system, so it is better equipped to saves lives. We will also press for reform of the World Bank and IMF to improve transparency, give more say to developing countries and, with the EU better focus their efforts on the poorest countries, particularly in Africa.  * Climate change and Africa  Britain has the chair of the G8 this year. We will use the summit for two particular purposes.  First, climate change is the one of the most pressing challenges that the world faces. We will continue to lead internationally on climate change, and to strive for wider acceptance of the science and the steps needed to combat the problem. We will look beyond Kyoto and promote an international dialogue to reach agreement on the long-term goals and action needed to stabilise the level of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. We will also work for effective international action to adapt to the impacts of climate change.  The UK has already met its obligations under the Kyoto Protocol. We remain committed to achieving a 20 per cent reduction in carbon dioxide emissions on 1990 levels by 2010, and our review of progress this summer will show us how to get back on track. A 60 per cent reduction by 2050 remains necessary and achievable.  We will continue to promote and develop renewable energy sources, to seek high standards of energy efficiency in the public and private sectors, and to support emissions trading in Europe and beyond.  Secondly we will focus on Africa and the global fight against poverty.  We have more than doubled aid since 1997. We have cancelled the debts of the poorest countries and are now pushing others to follow our lead and offer 100 per cent debt relief for the poorest. We are proud to have established a Department for International Development, with a clear mission to reduce poverty. Now, for the first time ever the UK has a clear timetable - 2013 - for achieving the UN target of 0. 7 per cent of national income devoted to development. Globally we are pressing for a doubling of aid backed by getting international agreement to an International Finance Facility as supported by the Commission for Africa.  But aid will not be successful without conflict prevention, good governance and zero tolerance of corruption. We will work for faster repatriation of stolen assets from UK financial institutions, ratification of the UN Convention on corruption, and more open and accountable reporting of revenues from oil and mining - that so often fuel local conflicts. Our commitment is to the people of the developing world; our contract is with their governments for reform. But if poor countries are committed to good governance and poverty reduction we then believe they should be in control of their own policies. We will end the practice of making aid conditional on sensitive economic policy choices, such as trade liberalisation and privatisation.  With this leadership and extra money, we can now work to ensure all children go to school, and millions of people in Asia and Africa suffering from AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria have access to treatment. In particular, we will press for an international agreement on universal access to AIDS treatment by 2010 and for all people in poor countries to have access to free basic healthcare and education.  Our long-term aim is to help lift a billion people out of poverty.  International policy  * Fair trade  We also know that without fairer trade rules and private investment, poor countries will not generate the growth needed to lift themselves out of poverty. We will press for the conclusion of an ambitious trade deal that will completely open markets to exports from poorer countries; for further reform of rich countries' agricultural subsidies, including the EU's Common Agricultural Policy and a 2010 timetable to end agricultural export subsidies. We do not believe poor countries should be forced to liberalise. We will allow them to sequence their trade reforms, so they can build their capacity to compete globally.  The choice for 2010  In 1997 the Tories had left Britain isolated in Europe, overseas aid had declined and we lacked any coherent vision of our place in the world. With Labour, a strong Britain will force international terrorism into retreat and help spread democracy and freedom around the world. We will be leaders in a reformed Europe, and, with others, make significant progress towards raising a billion people out of extreme poverty. We will fight for a new global agreement on climate change, an arms trade treaty, and a trade deal that makes trade work for the many, not just the few. Our armed forces will continue to be the best in the world. The alternative is to go back to the Tories with their record of cuts in aid and defence and their policies of tearing up the Social Chapter, and marginalising Britain in Europe and the world.  Chapter 8  Quality of life: Excellence for all Forward to Olympic gold, not back to cuts in sport and culture  Britain forward not back  1992-1997: Arts spending cut by 13 per cent in real terms  2005: Free entry to national museums, and visits up 75 per cent  2012: An Olympic legacy for Britain  Britain forward not back  Arts, culture and sport are thriving around Britain - enriching individual lives and transforming communities, towns and cities. They are important in their own right - as nourishment for our imagination or a source of plain enjoyment and our local environment should be a source of pride. We will work to improve the quality of life of every community in Britain.  * The new Labour case  We believe in the inherent value of arts, culture and sport. Our towns and cities are being energised by sports and culture and as they are regenerated the quality of life for all is transformed. As we build on this change, our progressive challenge is to broaden participation as widely as possible, making the links between sport and health, and culture and well-being. We must combine the broadest base of participation with the ability for the most talented to progress to the very top. Our third term will embed the expectation that every child and every adult have the maximum chance to develop their creative or sporting talents.  * Creative cities  Art and culture are valuable for their own sake; they are also crucial to our national prosperity. Britain's cultural industries now make up over eight per cent of our national income; and from computer games to the fine arts, British talent is gaining global recognition and generating real wealth. This is one of the fastest growing and fastest changing areas of the economy. And the transformation of our great cities is, in great part, a story of culture-led regeneration. We are proud of the record of Labour-led councils in leading this transformation, from Gateshead to Greenwich.  To help young talent get the right start we will work to establish Creative Apprenticeships. Through the National Endowment for Science, Technology and the Arts (NESTA) we are funding the Creative Pioneer Academy which will develop the entrepreneurial  skills of recent graduates with outstanding talents and original business ideas - and for some there will be the offer of up to £35, 000 to start their own business.  From 2006 we will provide £12 million over two years to the Arts Council England to promote leadership and management in the cultural sector. We want to invest in high-flyers developing commercial and business skills, encourage the talents of leading ethnic minority figures and improve the links between arts and business.  * Arts, culture and museums  Since 1997 we have increased funding for the arts by 73 per cent in real terms. We will continue to support our finest artists and institutions to achieve world-class standards.  Thanks to our policy of free admissions the number of people visiting formerly charging national museums and galleries has risen by 75 per cent over three years. Many are first-time visitors, with the biggest increases among children.  Victorian City leaders left us a legacy of great local and regional museums, and through our investment programme 'Renaissance in the Regions', we are re-creating them as centres of excellence. By 2008 we will have invested £147 million in partnerships across the country, modernising museum collections, broadening access to new audiences and providing a comprehensive service to schools. We will explore further ways to encourage philanthropy to boost the quality of our public art collections.  We will legislate, as soon as time allows, to implement the findings of the Heritage Protection Review, which allows the public a greater say in listing decisions.  Quality of life: Excellence for all  * Creative Sparks  Our aim is that everyone should have the opportunity to participate in cultural life, and we want that involvement to start as early as possible. Creative Partnerships, our programme of support for art in schools in our most disadvantaged areas, has already reached over 150, 000 children. We will build on this approach by rolling out our new programme Creative Sparks to guarantee that all children and young people will be given the chance to experience the very best of culture every year.  * Sport for all  Our aim is to increase participation in sport year on year. Central to this is having modern, high-quality facilities close to where people live. £1. 5 billion is being invested in sports facilities in every community. By 2008 our aim is that almost everyone will be within 20 minutes of a good multi-sport facility.  Grassroots clubs are the lifeblood of sports in Britain, and week in, week out, they are sustained by an army of volunteers. Reform of Sport England will continue, to reduce overheads and ensure that more money reaches the grassroots. We have put sports clubs at the forefront of our investment plans with the £100 million Community Club Development Scheme and mandatory rate relief at 80 per cent for registered Community Amateur Sports Clubs already worth about £5 million. As we review the operation of the new licensing regime we will ensure that there is not an unfair burden on local community groups, including sports clubs.  Investment in school sports will ensure that by 2010 all children will receive two hours high-quality PE or sport per week. Building on that, we pledge that by 2010 every child who wants it will have access to a further two to three hours sport per week.  'Our towns and cities  are being energised by  sports and culture and  as they are regenerated  the quality of life for  all is transformed. '  Every child should have the chance to compete at school. We have clamped down on the sale of playing fields: 96 per cent of schools in School Sport Partnerships now hold at least one sports day or sports festival each year. All secondary schools will be expected to field teams in regular competitive fixtures. We will also establish individual and team rankings in all the main sports, with clear and transparent success criteria.  * Sport in the community  To make it easier to get access to sports in your local area we will establish Sport Direct - a single point of access for sports in the UK. One website and one phone number will help you find out what's going on in your area. Together with £155 million from the Big Lottery Fund, the Government will ensure that children who have had little access to play facilities and those with a disability have much better access to safe, modern playgrounds.  Building on the lessons of the Football Foundation, we will develop a National Sports Foundation to bring resources from the private and voluntary sectors together with public money to invest in grassroots sporting facilities. We will work with the Premier League and the FA to find innovative ways of assisting community sport, including Supporters Direct. Having passed the necessary legislation, we remain committed to completing the sale of the Tote to a Racing Trust.  * The Olympics  Britain's medal hauls at the Sydney Olympics in 2000 and in Athens in 2004 were the best for over 80 years, and we maintained our position as one of the leading nations in the Paralympics. Now we are supporting the bid to bring the Olympics to London in 2012. Our plans would bring regeneration to the East End of London and will leave lasting sporting, economic and cultural legacies. As we approach the Olympics we will continue to invest in elite athletes through the Talented Athlete Scholarship Scheme for young athletes. In addition we have launched 2012 Scholarships worth around £10, 000 a year each for our most talented 12- to 18-year-olds.  Libraries in the information age  Where they offer new services like childcare, after-school education for pupils, and IT learning our libraries are successful. We will develop a strategy for the modernisation of our libraries which builds on the best, strengthens library leadership, sharpens customer focus and harnesses local popular support. We will encourage further cooperation in back-office functions and identify the best ways to improve our library infrastructure.  o Public service broadcasting and the BBC  We support a strong, independent and world-class BBC with clearly defined public purposes at the heart of a healthy public broadcasting system. We will replace the BBC Governors with a BBC Trust to ensure that the BBC's governance and regulation is accountable to the licence-fee payers to whom it belongs. The licence fee will be guaranteed for the whole of the ten-year Royal Charter that will take effect on 1 January 2007. Channel 4 will continue to be a publicly owned broadcaster providing distinctive competition to the BBC. ITV and Five will also be retained in our public service broadcasting system.  Digital switchover  The success of satelite and cable television in driving take-up of digital shows how changes in technology bring real benefits - in terms of greater choice, and increasingly, in access to services. Our aim is to make those benefits available to all. We will achieve digital switchover between 2008 and 2012 ensuring universal access to high-quality, free-to-view and subscription digital TV. This will happen region by region, and we will make sure that the interests of elderly people and other vulnerable groups are protected.  o Digital challenge  We will deliver our cross-government strategy for closing the digital divide and using ICT to further transform public services:  * By 2006 every school supported to offer all pupils access to computersat  home.  * A Digital Challenge for a local authority to be a national and itional pathfinder in universal digital service provision.  * A new National Internet Safety Unit to make Britain the safest placein the world to access the internet.  o Copyright in a digital age  We will modernise copyright and other forms of protection of intellectual property rights so that they are appropriate for the digital age. We will use our presidency of the EU to look at how to ensure content creators can protect their innovations in a digital age. Piracy is a growing threat and we will work with industry to protect against it.  Film  The strength of Britain's film industry is a source of pride, and employment. We will continue to make the UK the right place to invest in film production. We will legislate to provide new tax reliefs that will ensure support is delivered directly and efficiently to those who produce films.  We will work with the UK Film Council to achieve a higher priority for funding film festivals around the country, in particular for the Edinburgh Film Festival, the oldest in Britain.  o The Lottery  Every single part of British life has been touched by the £15 billion generated for good causes by the Lottery. Labour has made the Lottery more inclusive and more in tune with people's priorities. We have  created the Big Lottery Fund and given it an explicit mandate to involve people not just in setting strategy but also in awarding grants. Our Lottery Bill will give a duty and a power to every Lottery distributor to involve the public more radically in decision-making at every level.  By the end of 2005 we will put in place a new, national consultation on the way that the National Lottery good causes proceeds are spent after the new Lottery Licence is awarded in 2009.  * The local environment  The quality of our local environment is vital to our well-being and our natural environment is a key part of our national heritage.  The environment starts at the front door, and we have made action to improve the cleanliness of public spaces and communities a priority. The 2005 Clean Neighbourhoods and Environment Act will give local authorities and regulators the powers they have asked for to tackle litter, graffiti, abandoned cars, fly-tipping, noise pollution and other environmental concerns. We will further crack down on environmental crime, minimising litter, cleaning up graffiti and tackling fly-tipping. We will extend kerbside collection of at least two types of recyclable materials to all households in England by 2010. Polluters will have the opportunity to invest in environmental remediation or new local environmental projects rather than just pay fines. Rather than 'polluter pays' this new system would mean the 'polluter improves'.  Britain's beaches, rivers and drinking water are now of the highest ever quality. We have added 30, 000 hectares to the green belt while exceeding our target of building 60 per cent of new houses on brownfield sites. We have established the first National Park in England since the 1950s. To enhance our children's understanding of the environment we will give every school student the opportunity to experience outof-classroom learning in the natural environment.  Quality of life: Excellence for all  All newly developed communities - such as the Thames Gateway Development - will be built to high environmental standards on issues such as energy efficiency and water use, and we will develop a clear plan to minimise the impact of new communities on the environment. From April 2006, all new homes receiving government funding will meet the new Code for Sustainable Buildings and we will encourage local authorities to apply similar standards to private homes.  Through a Marine Act, we will introduce a new framework for the seas, based on marine spatial planning, that balances conservation, energy and resource needs. To obtain best value from different uses of our valuable marine resources, we must maintain and protect the ecosystems on which they depend.  The choice for 2010  The Tories have always neglected the arts, seeing them as an easy target for cuts. They do not understand the role that culture can play in the lives of individuals, in the futures of our towns and cities, and in the prosperity of our country. The choice is forward with new Labour to more sport in schools, arts for all children and young people, and continued investment in culture. Or back to the Tories and cuts of £207 million across culture, arts and sport.  Chapter 9  Democracy: Power devolved, citizens empowered Forward to reform and decentralisation not back to opportunism and neglect  Britain forward not back  1979-1997: Power centralised to Whitehall  1997-2005: Power devolved to Scotland,  Wales, London  2010: Stronger local government, with local communities able to make the key decisions about their own neighbourhoods  In our first two terms we enshrined a new constitutional settlement between the nations of the United Kingdom. In our next term we will complete the reform of the House of Lords so that it is a modern and effective revising Chamber. And we will devolve more power to local authorities and local communities, giving people real power over the issues that matter most to them.  * The new Labour case  Widening access to power is as important as widening access to wealth and opportunity. National standards are important to ensure fairness. But the best way to tackle exclusion is to give choice and power to those left behind. Our political institutions - including our own party - must engage a population overloaded with information, diverse in its values and lifestyles, and sceptical of power. However, people are passionate about politics - when they see it affects them. So our challenge is to bridge the chasm between government and governed. Our third term will build upon our unprecedented programme of constitutional reform embedding a culture of devolved government at the centre and self-government in our communities.  * Building from the neighbourhood up  People want a sense of control over their own neighbourhood. Not a new tier of neighbourhood government, but new powers over the problems that confront them when they step outside their front door - issues like litter, graffiti and anti-social behaviour. That is why we will offer neighbourhoods a range of powers from which they can choose, including:  * New powers for parish councils to deal with anti-social behaviour. * Powers for local people to trigger action in response to persistent local problems.  * Community funds for local neighbourhoods to spend on local priorities.  Democracy: Power devolved, citizens empowered  'Widening access to power is as important as widening access to wealthand opportunity. National standards are important to ensure fairness. '  * New opportunities for communities to assume greater responsibilityor even ownership of community assets like village halls, community centres, libraries or recreational facilities.  Good parish councils engage communities and make a real difference, so we will extend the right to establish parish councils to communities in London.  * A vibrant civil society  We believe that enterprises in the mutual and cooperative sector have an important role to play in the provision of local services, from health to education, from leisure to care for the vulnerable. As democratic, not-for-profit organisations, they can help to involve local people in shaping the services they want, unleash creativity and innovation, create jobs and provide new services - especially in neighbourhoods where traditional services have failed local people in the past.  We have introduced a new legal form - the Community Interest Company (CIC) - and want to support new enterprises. As a major stimulus to this sector, central government and local authorities will work with these 'social enterprises' wherever possible. Where services can be provided by mutuals, cooperatives or CICs to the required standards of quality and value for money, they should be positively encouraged to develop and be included in procurement policies. We will discuss with local authorities the best way to achieve this.  In a range of services the voluntary and community sector has shown itself to be innovative, efficient and effective. Its potential for service delivery should be considered on equal terms. We will continue to improve the context in which the gifting of time and resources to the voluntary sector takes place. We will reintroduce the widely supported reforms in the Charities Bill.  We understand that often the spark for local innovation and change comes from one or two dedicated, visionary individuals. These people, sometimes dubbed 'social entrepreneurs', deserve our full support. We will develop a framework of incentives and rewards, to recognise the special people in every community whose voluntary efforts transform the lives of others.  o A better alternative for young people  We know that parents and young people think that there should be more things to do and places to go for teenagers. We will publish plans to reform provision in order to ensure that all young people have access to a wider set of activities after the school day such as sport and the arts. We are determined that better provision will be allied to a stronger voice for the young themselves in designing and managing local provision. We will establish the first ever national framework for youth volunteering, action and engagement - a modern national youth community service, led by young people themselves - with an investment over the next three years of up to £100 million with matched funding from business, the voluntary sector and the Lottery.  o Councils: more freedom, less bureaucracy  Strong communities ultimately require strong local government. We will give councils further freedoms to deliver better local services, subject to minimum national standards, with even greater freedoms for top-performing councils. We will reduce unnecessary bureaucracy by cutting both the cost of inspection and the total number of inspectorates, and we will dramatically simplify the many funding streams available to local areas through new Local Area Agreements. We will also give councils greater stability by providing three-year funding. We will continue to deliver efficiency savings and improvements to local services through joint procurement, shared services, streamlining administrative structures while promoting decision-making at the level that will make a difference. We will continue to strengthen the  Democracy: Power devolved, citizens empowered  community leadership role of local authorities working in partnership with public, voluntary and private bodies.  o Stronger leadership  Strong local government requires strong leadership. We will ensure that councils are organised in the most effective way to lead and support local partnerships and deliver high-quality services. We will explore giving people a more direct opportunity to express a view about whether they would like to have a directly elected mayor. We will also consult with city councils on the powers needed for a new generation of city mayors. And we will examine the case for simplifying the current local government election cycle by moving towards 'whole council' elections every four years.  o Council tax under control  Labour recognises the concerns that have been raised about the level of council tax. This year we have delivered the lowest council tax increase in over a decade through a combination of extra investment and tough action to cap excessive increases.  We will continue to invest in local services with year-on-year increases in grants to local councils, and will not hesitate to use our capping powers to protect council taxpayers from excessive rises in council tax.  We remain concerned that many council taxpayers are not claiming reductions in their council tax bills to which they are already entitled. We will therefore introduce measures to make it easier for pensioners and people on low incomes to claim Council Tax Benefit.  In the longer term, we are committed to reforming council tax and will consider carefully the conclusions of the Lyons Review into local government finance.  'The best way to tackle exclusion is to givechoice and power to those left behind. '  * The nations and regions of the UK  In our first term, we devolved power to Scotland and Wales and restored city-wide government to London. Britain is stronger as a result. In the next Parliament, we will decentralise power further. In Wales we will develop democratic devolution by creating a stronger Assembly with enhanced legislative powers and a reformed structure and electoral system to make the exercise of Assembly responsibilities clearer and more accountable to the public. We will also review the powers of the London Mayor and the Greater London Authority. And we will devolve further responsibility to existing regional bodies in relation to planning, housing, economic development and transport.  * Northern Ireland  The Belfast Agreement on Good Friday 1998, was a remarkable achievement. Life in Northern Ireland is immeasurably better as a result. A huge programme of reform in policing, justice and rights, together with the lowest ever unemployment has helped address the inequalities of the past and has created a new confidence.  It is unacceptable that seven years after the agreement there are still paramilitary groups involved in criminality and punishment attacks. This has to end. The period of transition is over. Unionist politicians have made it clear that they are prepared to share power with nationalists and republicans if violence is ended once and for all. It is time for all groups in Northern Ireland to make it clear they will only use democratic and peaceful means to advance their aims.  We will work tirelessly with the parties in Northern Ireland and with the Irish government to re-establish the devolved institutions. But this can only happen on an inclusive basis if the IRA ends paramilitarism and criminality for good and decommissions its weapons. Bringing this about so that normal politics can take over in the Province will be our principal aim.  Loyalist paramilitary violence and criminality is equally intolerable. We will ensure that it is dealt with severely while providing the assistance necessary to Loyalist communities to ensure that prosperity is spread throughout Northern Ireland.  * Parliamentary reform  Labour has already taken steps to make the House of Commons more representative, through all-women shortlists. Labour will also continue to support reforms that improve parliamentary accountability and scrutiny led by the successful Modernisation Committee.  In our first term, we ended the absurdity of a House of Lords dominated by hereditary peers. Labour believes that a reformed Upper Chamber must be effective, legitimate and more representative without challenging the primacy of the House of Commons.  Following a review conducted by a committee of both Houses, we will seek agreement on codifying the key conventions of the Lords, and developing alternative forms of scrutiny that complement rather than replicate those of the Commons; the review should also explore how the upper chamber might offer a better route for public engagement in scrutiny and policy-making. We will legislate to place reasonable limits on the time bills spend in the second chamber - no longer than 60 sitting days for most bills.  As part of the process of modernisation, we will remove the remaining hereditary peers and allow a free vote on the composition of the House.  Labour remains committed to reviewing the experience of the new electoral systems - introduced for the devolved administrations, the European Parliament and the London Assembly. A referendum remains the right way to agree any change for Westminster.  Democracy: Power devolved, citizens empowered  Having been the first government to take action to clean up the funding of political parties, we will continue to work with the independent Electoral Commission to explore how best to support the vital democratic role of political parties while recognising that campaigning activity must always be funded by parties from their own resources.  Since 1997 there has been a flowering of innovative forms of public engagement, for example, the Citizens Council used by the National Institute for Clinical Excellence to advise on ethical dilemmas. With the growing importance of new public policy issues and dilemmas - particularly those arising from scientific advances - we will continue to explore new and innovative forms of public engagement raising their profile and status in policy-making.  * A voice for all  A fully democratic society depends on giving everyone a voice and stake. Only Labour governments have ever introduced race relations legislation, and laws passed in 2000 are ensuring that all public bodies promote diversity and tackle discrimination against black and Asian Britons. We will continue to promote civil rights for disabled people, ensuring full implementation of the new positive duty on the public sector to promote equality of opportunity for disabled people. We will also introduce a similar duty to promote equality of opportunity between women and men, and will further extend protection against discrimination on the grounds of religion and belief. We are committed to improving the rights and opportunities of gays and lesbians, that's why we brought in legislation on civil partnerships, reducing the age of consent, repealed Section 28 and reformed the sexual offences legislation so that it was no longer discriminatory.  It remains our firm and clear intention to give people of all faiths the same protection against incitement to hatred on the basis of their religion. We will legislate to outlaw it and will continue the dialogue we have started with faith groups from all backgrounds about how best to balance protection, tolerance and free speech.  We are proud to have brought in the Human Rights Act, enabling British citizens to take action in British courts rather than having to wait years to seek redress in Strasbourg. But rights must be balanced by responsibilities. So we will continue to bear down on abusive or frivolous claims.  In the next Parliament we will establish a Commission on Equality and Human Rights to promote equality for all and, tackle discrimination, and introduce a Single Equality Act to modernise and simplify equality legislation.  The choice for 2010  The Tories have only one policy on democratic reform - opportunism. Arch centralisers when in office, they now claim to be localists. Having refused for decades to accept any reform of the archaic House of Lords, some of them now claim to support a fully elected House. The choice is forward with new Labour to modern institutions and more power than ever devolved to communities and successful local authorities. Or back with the Tories to a government indifferent to the health of our democracy and negligent of our institutions."
"Liberal Democrats",200505,"The Real Alternative  Applicability note:  Liberal Democrats have championed the devolution of powers to Scotland and Wales, and many decisions made in Westminster now apply to England only. That means that policies in those nations are increasingly different from those in England  reflecting different choices, priorities and circumstances, and often the influence of Liberal Democrats in government. Our Scottish and Welsh Parties will publish their own manifestos, based on this document but reflecting those differences. This manifesto sets out our plans for a Liberal Democrat government in Westminster.  Promoted and published by Chris Rennard on behalf of the Liberal Democrats, both at 4 Cowley Street, London, SW1P 3NB.  INTRODUCTION BY CHARLES KENNEDY  I believe that the 2001  2005 parliament will be remembered as the period during which the Liberal Democrats came of age, ushering in a new era of truly three-party politics. That is why we enter this General Election campaign with such optimism, unity of purpose and public goodwill.  We have been tested  inside and outside parliament  as never before. We have stuck to our principles: from our opposition to the war in Iraq to our defence of fundamental civil liberties over control orders. Again and again, we have been the real opposition to Tony Blairs increasingly discredited Government  over Council Tax, top-up and tuition fees, and ID cards.  The challenge  and the opportunity  is now to provide the real alternative at this election. That is what this manifesto is all about  detailing our analysis and policy ambitions; and all of it is underpinned by costed and credible pledges. We are determined that what we promise can be achieved. Our figures, based on official costings, all add up. And at the heart of our programme is a determination to achieve a fairer and more straightforward tax system which delivers the social priorities we believe that people want.  The mark of a decent society is one which creates opportunity for young people and provides security and dignity for those in their older years. At both ends of the age spectrum, we believe that Britain must do better. Thats why we set our commitment to abolishing student top-up and tuition fees alongside our determination to guarantee free long-term personal care for the elderly. And we can point with pride to the example of Scotland, where Liberal Democrat ministers in government have already delivered both these policies. In addition, we would scrap the Council Tax and replace it with a fair system based on peoples ability to pay.  Society is still scarred by inequality. Tackling that is a priority for the Liberal Democrats. For example, its time that we redressed the scandalous discrimination against women in the state pension system. We propose a citizens pension, based on residency instead of national insurance contributions, which would  at last  provide women who have spent time caring for children and elderly parents a pension in their own right.  In addition, we remain proud of a Britain which is enriched precisely because it is a multi-racial, multi-ethnic society. We will not pander to fear and prejudice. We offer fair and effective policies over the distinct issues of asylum and immigration.  Through all our thinking, there is a green thread of environmental awareness and urgency. We are by far the greenest of the three main UK political parties and this manifesto again confirms that fact.  It is a privilege at this election to be leading the most socially progressive party in British politics. Our priorities here at home are clear; our instinctive internationalism  through positive and proactive engagement with Europe, the United Nations and the Commonwealth  is definitive.  I am ambitious for the Liberal Democrats and the Liberal Democrats are the real alternative at this election. Please read, reflect  and if you like what we stand for, your support can make the difference.    OUR PRINCIPLES   Freedom. Fairness. Trust. These are the qualities of the British people at their best, and they are the guiding principles of the Liberal Democrats.  This manifesto is built on these principles  principles that we believe must underpin the government of this country, but which are too often lacking in public life today.  FREEDOM  because Liberal Democrats believe that individuals should govern their own lives, free from unnecessary interference by government or society. So we want to build a society which gives individual men and women opportunities to pursue their aims, develop their talents and shape their successes. A country where people are free to shape their future is stronger, wealthier, happier, and more fulfilled.  FAIRNESS  because ill-health, disability, poverty, environmental pollution and the fear of crime curtail freedom, just as much as discriminatory laws or arrest without trial. So we want government to provide the essential requirements that everyone needs to make real choices in their lives  a good education, a decent pension, a clean environment, effective policing and high quality healthcare. And we want to see fairness too in the way in which taxes are raised and minorities are treated.  TRUST  because to deliver freedom and fairness, we need to give citizens the power to hold government to account. So we want to see government brought closer to the people it is meant to serve  which is why we are committed to curtail the personal power and patronage of the Prime Minister, strengthen British democracy, and hand many powers back from central government to local neighbourhoods, with real democratic control over those who wield power.  Throughout this manifesto we explain how we will put these beliefs into practice creating a society where people are more free, where government exercises its powers more fairly, and where the bond of trust is re-established between the people and their government.  Throughout this manifesto, we recognise our responsibility to future generations, to protect the precious environment that sustains all life on the planet. Policies for environmental sustainability are therefore set out in every area  because for us, environmental policy is not an optional extra but an integral part of the way in which we will govern.  Throughout this manifesto, we show how we can help achieve these aims through Britain playing a leading role in Europe and on the wider international stage, building effective global institutions and acting in accordance with international laws  because in an ever more globalised and interdependent world, isolation is in none of our interests.  Throughout this manifesto you will find this Liberal Democrat approach. Freedom. Fairness. Trust.  Costings  Liberal Democrats are open and straightforward about how we will pay for our policies. At the last three general elections we set out full details of how much our policies would cost and how we would pay for them. None of the other parties did this.  Labour has increased spending, an increase only the Liberal Democrats were honest enough to propose at the last election. Given this growth in spending, most of our proposals at this election can be funded from savings in current budgets. This means switching around £5 billion each year from low-priority government programmes in order to fund our key proposals. Our savings include:  - CUTTING SUBSIDIES. By abolishing the Department of Trade and Industry and ending unnecessary subsidies we will save approximately one third of the Departments expenditure. This will be re-invested instead in our priorities set out in this manifesto.  - USING THE MONEY SET ASIDE FOR THE CHANCELLORS CHILD TRUST FUND TO CUT CLASS SIZES IN PRIMARY SCHOOLS. The Child Trust Fund will cost almost £1.5 billion over a parliament to give cash handouts when todays babies reach 18. Its better for these children to benefit from the money now, in their early years, by cutting class sizes.  - NOT INTRODUCING ID CARDS. Hundreds of millions can be saved by not introducing ID cards. That money would be better spent on increasing the number of police on the streets by 10,000 and providing them with the technology to make them more effective.  We will also make taxes fairer  cutting costs for most people. At present, people on low incomes or in old age have to pay a higher proportion of their income in taxes and government charges than those who are much better off. That cannot be right. Today, under Labour, the poorest 20 per cent of the population pay 38 per cent of their income in tax, compared with just 35 per cent for the richest 20 per cent. That is unfair. Three of our key policies will create a fairer distribution of the costs of public services*:  SCRAPPING TUITION AND TOP-UP FEES FOR STUDENTS.  Cost: £1.2 billion per year.  INTRODUCING FREE PERSONAL CARE FOR ELDERLY AND DISABLED PEOPLE.  Cost: £1.7 billion per year.  KEEPING DOWN LOCAL TAXES (AS WELL AS BASING THEM ON ABILITY TO PAY).  Cost: £2.0 billion per year.  These three items will cost £4.9 billion and we will pay for them with one tax change. We will introduce a new 50 per cent rate on the portion of individual income exceeding £100,000 a year. Just one per cent of taxpayers will pay this (because they can afford to) whilst most people will be better off as we abolish student tuition fees, abolish care charges for the elderly, and abolish the Council Tax.  * All figures are for financial year 2006/7.  MATTHEW TAYLOR  CHAIR OF THE LIBERAL DEMOCRAT PARLIAMENTARY PARTY   Green Action  The environment features on every page of this manifesto  a strong green thread running through everything we do and promise.    PUTTING PATIENTS FIRST    It is not asking much, surely? A National Health Service that helps you stay healthy, and makes sure that when you do fall ill you are treated quickly, irrespective of wealth or status.  Yet despite the investment now going in  which Liberal Democrats so famously pressed the government to deliver  far too much is still wrong in the NHS.  Older people needing basic care, such as feeding, dressing and washing, are too often forced to pay  sometimes even to sell their homes  despite the Governments own Royal Commission report saying this is wrong.  Instead of doctors and nurses being freed up to give their best to patients, Labour ministers try to pull the strings with pointless targets and endless bureaucracy. Instead of clean wards and the most modern equipment, MRSA and other superbugs are spreading, and scanners lie idle for lack of trained staff.  Labour and Conservative politicians talk about choice  but health care isnt like choosing a supermarket or a pair of shoes. I believe that choice has a place in the NHS, but I dont subscribe to the false idea that choice will solve all its problems. When you have a heart attack or a serious accident, and are rushed to hospital, no one wants to know that if they could have had the choice theres a hospital fifty miles away with better funding and better equipment. What people want is their own local hospital well-funded, well-staffed and well-equipped to give them the best possible chance to survive and recover.  The NHS was conceived by Beveridge, a Liberal, and brought into being by a Labour administration very different from todays Government. Too often hitting the government target means missing the point. It is time to remember the founding principles of the NHS: care, of the highest possible quality, available fairly to all who need it, with doctors free to focus on the patient, not the red tape.  Paul Burstow  Liberal Democrat Shadow Secretary of State for Health  Health  FREE PERSONAL CARE. Those towards the end of their lives deserve the best possible care. Liberal Democrats will provide free personal care for elderly people and people with disabilities, for as long as they need it, funded out of our new 50 per cent rate on that part of peoples incomes over £100,000. In short, we will implement the recommendations of the independent Royal Commission on Long-Term Care. Liberal Democrats in government in Scotland have already achieved this for elderly people.  QUICKER DIAGNOSIS FOR SERIOUS CONDITIONS  SO YOUR NHS TREATMENT IS NOT DELAYED. Your chances of surviving life-threatening and debilitating illnesses improve the swifter the diagnosis. When a GP considers you may have a serious illness we will make sure you are offered diagnosis by the quickest practical route, public or private, so that the NHS can treat you more quickly. More tests and scans will be available in places like GPs surgeries and community pharmacies. We will tackle the scandal of expensive scanners being under-used by investing in training, recruitment and retention of the key staff needed to operate them. We will provide more scans at weekends and in the evenings. We will publish waiting times for tests and scans  figures which the Labour Government has refused to make public.  CUT UNFAIR CHARGES  FREE EYE AND DENTAL CHECKS, FEWER PRESCRIPTION CHARGES. To reduce the risk of illness going undetected we will end the charges for eye and dental check-ups which deter people from coming forward for testing. It is also unfair that some people living with long-term conditions pay no prescription charges, while people with other, equally serious, conditions (such as cystic fibrosis and multiple sclerosis) have to pay. We will extend the range of long-term conditions which qualify for exemption from prescription charges, based on an independent review.  PUT PATIENTS FIRST  MORE DOCTORS AND NURSES, FREE FROM WHITEHALL MEDDLING. We will complete NHS plans to recruit at least an extra 8,000 more doctors, 12,000 more nurses and 18,000 more therapists and scientists by 2008. That will cut waiting times and improve the quality of care. Doctors, nurses and therapists are highly trained and dedicated health professionals, while ministers and civil servants are not. Liberal Democrats will hack away the red tape and abolish the absurd targets set by government, and free frustrated health professionals from demoralising government meddling. Clinical decisions should be taken by health professionals and local investment will be determined by locally elected and accountable people who can be removed by local people if they get it wrong. Scrapping unnecessary centralised targets will mean that your local hospital will have the time and flexibility to put patients first, providing personalised care and cleaner hospitals and treating the sickest the quickest.  HIGH-QUALITY DENTAL CARE. Many people cant find an NHS dentist to take them on. We will reform NHS dental contracts so that more dentists are encouraged to do more NHS work. This will rebuild the relationship between the dental profession and government which has been badly damaged under Conservatives and Labour. Personal Dental Plans will set out how frequently people should have a check-up, how better to look after their teeth and, for those with serious dental problems, their future course of treatment.  GIVE PEOPLE MORE CONTROL OVER THEIR HEALTHCARE. We will encourage regular health MoTs tailored to individual patients needs, with wider access to screening and blood pressure and cholesterol tests. Tens of thousands of patients die in the NHS every year without access to specialised care and pain management. We will prioritise extending choice and access to these services, including more support for hospices. People with long-term conditions should be entitled to an agreed Personal Care Plan, setting out their course of treatment, where and when they will be treated, and what other help, such as social care, they will receive. We will introduce new legislation to safeguard the rights and welfare of people with mental health problems, allowing them to exercise more control over their treatment. We will end inappropriate age discrimination within the NHS; for example, many older women are not currently invited for the routine breast cancer screening which could save their lives.  PREVENTION IS AS IMPORTANT AS CURE. We will concentrate on helping people stay healthy, as well as caring for them when they fall ill. According to the NHS report, Securing our Future Health, the Governments failure to tackle the unnecessary causes of ill-health will cost the NHS an extra £30 billion a year by 2022. If the causes of ill-health arent tackled, the NHS of the future wont be able to cope  so we will give people the information and opportunities to make healthy choices, for example through clearer food and alcohol labelling. To improve childrens health, on top of plans to increase funding for school meals, we will introduce minimum nutrition standards for school meals, as we already have in Scotland; we will restrict advertising of unhealthy food during childrens television programmes; and we will require food and drink sold in vending machines on school premises to meet minimum health and nutrition standards. Because second-hand smoke kills, we will ban smoking in all enclosed public places. Our policies as a whole will help tackle other causes of ill-health, such as poverty, pollution and poor housing.  Green Action:  CLEAN AIR AND WATER. Pollution in the air, in water and in the food chain causes or aggravates many illnesses as well as destroying the environment. We support the adoption of the EU Registration, Evaluation and Authorisation of Chemicals (REACH) Directive. This will mean that information becomes available to the public on the consequences of exposure to all chemicals in daily use and that those of high concern are replaced by safer alternatives.  PROMOTE WALKING AND CYCLING. Fewer school-run car journeys means less pollution, less congestion and fewer road deaths. Children walking or cycling to school also get fitter  but the journey must be safe. Liberal Democrats will encourage and promote nationally what many Liberal Democrat councils already do locally, such as Safe Routes to School with calmed traffic, safe pavements, good lighting and adults on hand to conduct walking buses. We will also provide more cycle routes and reform planning rules to make sure that key services are more easily accessible by foot or bicycle. This will benefit adults as well as children.  My diagnosis for the NHS is simple really  and the Liberal Democrats share it. More doctors, nurses and health professionals on the front line, free to take professional decisions on the basis of patient need, speedier diagnosis, and effective treatment. Labours red tape, and Conservative private subsidies, make no sense.  JULIA NEUBERGER  LIBERAL DEMOCRAT HEALTH SPOKESPERSON IN THE LORDS AND FORMER CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF THE LEADING HEALTH POLICY INSTITUTE, THE KINGS FUND  Ambitious for Every Child  The finest investment our generation can make is to give a high-quality education to the next generation. Nothing sets a child free more than this. If we are successful, each and every child is given the opportunity to unlock their potential. If we fail then we put their whole future at risk.  Before I became an MP I worked for thirty four years as a teacher  the last fifteen as head teacher of one of Britains largest secondary schools. I taught some of the most disadvantaged children in the country, and I saw at first hand the power of a high-quality education. Indeed, my passion to enter Parliament came because I could no longer stand aside whilst politicians continued to fail our children.  As a head teacher I was utterly dismayed by the way in which Conservative and Labour politicians used education as a political football. Each new education minister had to make their mark by changing the curriculum, increasing red tape, interfering in the classroom and pretending education could be micro-managed from London. Yet not one of them seemed genuinely prepared to fight for the investment needed to reduce class sizes, provide modern equipment, support good discipline and provide a well-trained teacher workforce.  The policies I have helped develop are about addressing these issues. They are about striving for excellence and being ambitious for every child and every student. I want our young people to maximise their potential by being free to choose the most appropriate university course without fear of a mountain of debt. I want them to be able to choose high-quality apprenticeships and skill training  not as a second-best option but ranked alongside traditional academic pathways. And I want to see adults, too, being given the opportunity to acquire new skills to meet the demands of ever-changing technologies and global competition.  Parents are rightly ambitious for their children  I most certainly was for my own. I am proud of what many children already achieve, but more can be done. Quite simply, we must be ambitious for every child.  PHIL WILLIS  LIBERAL DEMOCRAT SHADOW SECRETARY OF STATE FOR EDUCATION AND SKILLS   Education and Skills  NO TUITION FEES, NO TOP-UP FEES, FAIR GRANTS  UNIVERSITY AFFORDABLE FOR EVERY STUDENT. Labour broke their promise on tuition fees. The result: tens of thousands of able students are saddled with mortgage-sized debts or deterred altogether from going to university. Funded from part of our new 50 per cent rate on incomes over £100,000, Liberal Democrats will abolish all tuition fees and make grants available to help poorer students with maintenance costs. That will build on the achievements of Liberal Democrats in government in Scotland. No one will be denied the opportunity of a university education because of the fear of debt, while universities will receive the increased funds they need.  CUT CLASS SIZES  USING THE £1.5 BILLION CHILD TRUST FUND. Expert opinion confirms what common sense tells us: children well taught and well-cared-for in their early years have a better opportunity to lead successful and rewarding lives. The Government has the wrong priorities, handing out a one-off cash windfall to 18 year-olds at taxpayers expense through the Child Trust Fund. Liberal Democrats will use this money better by recruiting 21,000 more teachers to cut infant class sizes from the present maximum of 30 to an average of 20, and junior class sizes to an average of 25. We will extend before and after school provision from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. for all children and complete 3500 Childrens Centres by 2010. Building on our Maternity Income Guarantee, which will raise maternity pay for the first six months to £170 a week instead of £102.80 at present, these policies will give every child the best possible start.  EVERY CHILD TAUGHT ENGLISH, MATHS, SCIENCE, MODERN LANGUAGES, PLUS INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGY, BY SUITABLY QUALIFIED TEACHERS. The teacher recruitment crisis means that thousands of children are being taught key subjects by staff who are not trained specialists in that subject. Liberal Democrats will guarantee that all children will be taught the core subjects of English, Maths, Science, Modern Languages and ICT by suitably qualified teachers through funding secondary schools to provide the necessary high-quality teacher-training courses in these subjects.  SCHOOL DISCIPLINE. Children need to learn in a safe and orderly environment, where high standards of behaviour are upheld, where bullying is challenged effectively and where teachers are able to teach without disruption. Our smaller class sizes will help reduce discipline problems. To deal with more persistent disruption schools will agree externally-monitored positive behaviour plans with parents and pupils. If necessary, local education authorities Behavioural Support Units will tackle exceptional problems in particular schools. When all else fails we will guarantee that head teachers will have local education authority support for managed transfer to other schools or special units for pupils whose behaviour remains unacceptable.  TIME TO TEACH. Children in England are now the most tested in Europe, yet there is little evidence that the Governments obsession with testing and targets has improved standards. Liberal Democrats believe that teachers should be given more time to teach and that testing should have a clear purpose: to improve learning for individual children. We will reduce the level of external testing, replacing compulsory tests at seven and eleven with a system of sampling against national standards. Teachers will regularly assess pupils performance, using the results to inform teaching and give parents accurate information on their childs progress.  SPECIAL EDUCATIONAL NEEDS. Children with special educational needs should be schooled in an environment appropriate to their needs - usually in local schools with appropriate support, or in specialist schools for those who need them. Parents wishes must be considered when making decisions about type of schooling. A designated teacher in each school will have responsibility to identify and plan for children with special needs, and act as a contact point for parents and other teachers. We will make sure that all teachers and teaching assistants working with children with special educational needs are appropriately trained. Special schools will act as resource centres to support local schools with their specialist provision. In turn special schools will be linked to research departments in universities so that they can benefit directly from, and be involved with, the latest research in special education.  SKILLS FOR WORK. School-leavers should be equipped with the skills they need to succeed in the workplace. We will combine GCSE, A-level and vocational programmes of study within a new diploma system, stretching the most gifted and engaging those previously turned off by schooling. We will give all students over the age of 14 the opportunity to combine vocational and academic learning, as Liberal Democrats in government in Scotland are already doing.  WORLD-CLASS SKILLS FOR A WORLD-CLASS ECONOMY. We are committed to closing the funding gap between schools and colleges, starting by providing equal funding for equivalent courses, wherever they are taught. To deliver world-class skills, world-class facilities are needed. We will implement plans to invest in the modern, high-quality college facilities needed to deliver high-quality skills training.  SCHOOL TRANSPORT. We will maintain the right of children to free school transport when they live more than two miles from their designated primary school and three miles from their secondary school  a right which is being taken away by the Labour Government. For those who live nearer school, there still need to be safe alternatives to the car; we will promote Safe Routes to School, with calmed traffic, safe pavements, good lighting and adults on hand to conduct walking buses.  Green Action:  GREEN EVERY SCHOOL, COLLEGE AND UNIVERSITY. All plans for new educational buildings must be good for the environment as well as good for education, for example by minimising the need for heating and using sustainable building materials. By putting the two together, children and students can learn about caring for the environment by seeing green projects in real action in their own school or college. We also believe that out-of-classroom learning is a key part of a good education, and will include the quality of out-of-classroom education in the criteria on which schools are inspected.  In Scotland, thanks to Liberal Democrats in government, we have already abolished tuition fees, just as we promised. When you vote Liberal Democrat, people can now see it really makes the difference. This time, I hope youll help us deliver the same for all of Britain.  JIM WALLACE QC MSP  DEPUTY FIRST MINISTER OF THE SCOTTISH EXECUTIVE AND MINISTER FOR ENTERPRISE AND LIFELONG LEARNING  TACKLING CRIME, DEFENDING LIBERTY  Crime  and the fear of crime  wrecks peoples lives. Governments keep talking tough, but everyone knows it isnt working. Its time to concentrate on the basics: more police on the beat, more effort to stop prisoners re-offending, more help for victims of crime.  This Government just keeps trying to take away citizens basic freedoms  such as the right to jury trial, or to demonstrate peacefully outside parliament. They even wanted the power to lock anyone up at the whim of the Home Secretary. They plan to charge every citizen nearly £100 each to hold a compulsory identity card, despite the fact that other countries have found that they dont work. Its all done in the name of cutting crime and tackling terrorism; but it is the terrorists who want to take away freedom and democracy  our government should defend our liberties.  The truth is that ID cards did not stop the Spanish train bombs, and even the 9/11 bombers had their papers in order. The US has ruled out ID cards because they dont work. What stops both terrorists and criminals is good intelligence and effective investigation  and that takes a lot more police. What protects Britains borders is not costly ID cards for law-abiding British citizens, but a strong UK Border Force detecting illegal entry and criminal activity.  Both the Conservatives and Labour like to talk tough, but have failed to deliver. I want my children to grow up in a safe community, while keeping intact the basic freedoms for which the British people have fought so hard across the centuries.  MARK OATEN  LIBERAL DEMOCRAT SHADOW HOME SECRETARY   Justice and Crime  10,000 MORE POLICE ON THE STREETS  CUT CRIME AND THE FEAR OF CRIME. By getting rid of Labours expensive, illiberal and ineffective ID card scheme, we will pay for 10,000 police on top of Labours plans. We will also complete existing plans for an extra 20,000 community support officers to back them up. The average police officer today spends more time in the police station than they do on the streets. We will give the police the technology they need, and simplify the bureaucracy they face, to allow them to spend more time on patrol and less time tied to the desk. We will concentrate more police efforts on tackling drug traffickers and those drug users who resort to crime to feed their habits, rather than criminalising people possessing cannabis only for their own personal use.  MAKE OFFENDERS PAY BACK TO VICTIMS AND THEIR COMMUNITIES. Liberal Democrats will make more non-violent criminals, such as fine defaulters, shoplifters and petty vandals, do tough community work as an alternative to jail. Experience shows that this reduces re-offending, gives them skills for legitimate work, and means that they pay back to the community. Through Community Justice Panels, local people will have more say in the punishment offenders carry out in the community  for example, by making them clean off graffiti or repair damage to victims property.  GET TOUGH ON ANTI-SOCIAL BEHAVIOUR. Many towns and cities are becoming no-go areas at the weekend. We will tackle excessive drinking by cracking down on licensees who serve people when clearly drunk or under-age. We will make big late-night venues contribute to the cost of extra late-night policing. Unacceptable noise and offensive behaviour will be tackled through Acceptable Behaviour Contracts agreed between the individual, their family, the police and the local authority. Where individuals do not co-operate we will use Anti-Social Behaviour Orders, plus appropriate measures to tackle underlying causes.  GIVE PRISONERS SKILLS FOR WORK, NOT CRIME. With four out of five prisoners functionally illiterate, and over half of prisoners re-offending, its time to make prison work. Prisoners will be subject to a tough working day, with increased resources for education and training a top priority so that they learn the skills to acquire a legitimate job. The effort a prisoner puts into their education and work-related skills will be one of the factors used when considering their release date, as part of our emphasis on tackling the causes of crime.  QUALITY INVESTIGATIONS, SAFE CONVICTIONS, FIGHTING CRIME AND TERROR. We will increase police resources to improve the detection and investigation of crime. We will create a co-ordinated UK Border Force to strengthen the countrys borders against terrorism, people-trafficking and drug smuggling. We oppose moves to reduce or remove rights to jury trial, and the routine use of hearsay evidence or revelation of previous convictions. We opposed Labours plans to allow the Home Secretary to order house arrest and other restrictions on personal liberty. A British citizens liberty must only be removed through a fair judicial process, not on the command of politicians. Liberal Democrats achieved substantial amendment of the Prevention of Terrorism Act, but it still has serious flaws, and we will repeal it. Effective action against terrorism is vital, and our priority will be to extend the criminal law to enable terrorist suspects to be prosecuted in the mainstream courts. We will admit evidence from communications interception. If control orders are still required they must be granted by a judge, be time-limited and be subject to a high standard of proof.  FIRM BUT FAIR ON ASYLUM. For centuries Britain has had a proud record of granting safe refuge to those fleeing persecution. In turn, refugees have enriched the UKs culture and wealth immeasurably. The Home Office has a record of delays and bad decisions on asylum, so we will transfer responsibility for assessing asylum claims to a dedicated agency to sort out the mess, ensuring that those who need help get it, whilst those who dont cant abuse the system. We will work within the EU to develop common standards so that all EU countries take their fair share of refugees. We will also end asylum-seekers dependence on benefits, allowing them to work so they can pay their own way and use their skills to benefit everyone.  STRENGTHEN THE FIGHT AGAINST DISCRIMINATION. We will introduce a Single Equality Act to outlaw all unfair discrimination, (including on the grounds of race, gender, religion or belief, sexual orientation, disability, age or gender identity), thus giving equal protection for all. We will establish hate-crimes investigation units in each police force to co-ordinate information and action against racism, homophobia and other hate crimes. Liberal Democrats led the call for an amendment to the laws on incitement to racial hatred, to criminalise those who use religious words as a pretext for race hate. Our Equality Act will stop same-sex couples in civil partnerships being treated unfairly compared with married couples in pension arrangements.  Green Action:  TOUGHER ACTION TO ENFORCE HIGH ENVIRONMENTAL STANDARDS. The courts have struggled to enforce the rules in environmental cases that are often highly technical and specialised. We will improve the enforcement of pollution controls through a specialist Environmental Tribunal to deal with enforcing environmental rules. We will also make sure that the level of penalties that polluters have to pay are appropriate to the offence  at present they are often trivial compared to the profits from environmental crime.  I have been been horrified to find that Labour doesnt seem to understand that in fighting crime and terrorism, the point is to defend Britains justice and democracy, not give it away. Tough Liberal policies put more police on the beat and tackle the causes of crime. We wont surrender Britains liberties.  NAVNIT DHOLAKIA  LIBERAL DEMOCRAT DEPUTY LEADER IN THE LORDS AND SPOKESPERSON ON HOME AFFAIRS  BUILDING PROSPERITY FOR BRITAIN  There is no job more important for any government than managing the economy well.  When Labour was first elected, they seemed to understand this. Liberal Democrats were the first to propose making the Bank of England independent, to stop politicians playing with interest rates to suit their own re-election rather than the economy. Gordon Brown adopted this suggestion, even though there had been nothing in Labours manifesto about it.  As a result, and by balancing the books  with the advantage of relatively good world economic conditions  the economy prospered.  Increasingly, Labour has started to make mistakes. Too many rules and tax complications, holding businesses back. Inadequate action to contain the explosion of personal debt. Economic forecasts making unrealistic assumptions about future growth. Failure to take the tough decisions to prioritise taxpayers money, to spend it where it matters most. Over-complicated tax credits and means-tested benefits.  As the former Chief Economist at Shell, I have wrestled with these problems all my life, including advising governments. I know these decisions are not easy  and can easily be thrown by world events.  So I want to make clear my priorities for managing the economy:  First, and most important, I will ensure a stable and well-managed economy. Ill stick to the Golden Rules  that government borrowing should only finance investment over the economic cycle, and that government debt should be no higher that 40 per cent of GDP. To make sure of that, Ill give the National Audit Office the job of publicly checking the budget figures.  Second, I will insist on tough choices on public spending, cutting out low priorities in order to spend more on what matters most. As a result, all our policies are costed and affordable.  Third, I will introduce fairer taxes. Our only net tax rise in this manifesto is on that slice of peoples earnings over £100,000 a year, in order to abolish student tuition fees and care charges on the elderly, and cut local taxes. But we will make taxes fairer  such as replacing the Council Tax with a system based on ability to pay. The typical households tax bill will be cut by around £450 each year as a result.  Finally, simpler taxes. Gordon Brown has endlessly made the tax system more complex and unworkable. That, in the end, is self-defeating, simply adding to business costs, chaos at the Inland Revenue, and misery for confused taxpayers.  These simple rules are my basic principles  and foundationstones for Britains future prosperity.  VINCENT CABLE  LIBERAL DEMOCRAT SHADOW CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER   The Economy  ALL OUR POLICIES ARE COSTED AND AFFORDABLE. Unlike the other parties, we have consistently set out costings for our manifesto pledges, explaining how much money they will need and how they will all be paid for. So this manifesto includes a specific section outlining our main costings. Our package of tough choices on spending, and fairer taxes, means that most people will be better off. There is only one proposed net tax rise (to 50 per cent on the proportion of incomes over £100,000 a year, affecting just one per cent of taxpayers) which will pay for the abolition of student tuition fees, free personal care for the elderly, and lower local taxes. Most peoples tax will be cut by replacing Council Tax with a system based on ability to pay, saving the typical household around £450 per year.  TOUGH CHOICES IN PUBLIC SPENDING. Liberal Democrats have different spending priorities from Labour. We believe that in order to concentrate resources on currently under-funded areas such as pensions, policing and early years education, funding should be switched from lower priority areas. That means reducing unnecessary subsidies to industry, and cutting wasteful new initiatives like the ID card and the Child Trust Fund handouts for future 18 year-olds. This will allow us to spend more on the things that really matter, like better pensions, more police and smaller class sizes.  A STABLE, WELL-MANAGED ECONOMY. We welcome the greater economic stability that has been established since interest rates were set independently by the Bank of England (which the Liberal Democrats were the first party to advocate). Now, there needs to be more independent scrutiny and discipline in fiscal policy. We will give the National Audit Office the power to scrutinise the budget figures, including public borrowing, so that no Chancellor can fiddle the figures. We will make sure that the Office for National Statistics is independent and accountable to parliament, not subservient to ministers. We will tackle irresponsible credit expansion in mortgages and personal loans by curbing misleading advertising and anti-competitive practices by promoters of insurance for mortgages and loans, and of credit cards. We oppose the increasing complexity of business taxes and we will consult with business on a simpler and fairer system, giving priority to helping small businesses.  FAIRER TAXES. Under Labour, ordinary hard-working families pay more as a share of their incomes in tax than the very rich. Under Labour, the elderly have to sell their homes to pay for their care, while rising Council Tax and university top-up fees are making the system even more unfair. Taking all taxes together, the poorest 20 per cent of the population pay 38 per cent of their income in tax, compared to just 35 per cent for the richest 20 per cent. Thats not what people expected from a Labour Government. Liberal Democrats will make the tax system fairer and simpler. As a first step towards reducing tax paid by low earners, we will axe the unfair Council Tax and replace it with a Local Income Tax based on peoples ability to pay. This will cut the typical households tax bill by over £450. To pay for our policies of abolishing student top-up and tuition fees, ending elderly and disabled people needing to pay for their care, and cutting Council Tax, the richest one per cent of the population will pay 50 per cent tax (up from 41 per cent) on that part of their income over £100,000 per year.  CUT STAMP DUTY. People are increasingly struggling to afford their first home. We will raise the starting point for stamp duty from £120,000 to £150,000. This step will take 150,000 mainly first-time buyers out of paying stamp duty altogether, and cuts the cost of home ownership.  AN OUTWARD-LOOKING ECONOMY. Liberal Democrats support a liberal economic approach to trade, investment and migration in the national interest. We want Britain to be at the centre of a liberalised, reformed European Union. Liberal Democrats believe that Britain should work to create the right economic conditions to join the euro (subject to a referendum) in order to safeguard investment in the UK and reduce the cost and risk of trade with the rest of Europe. We will work to break down the trade barriers that prevent the poorest countries in the world selling their goods to the richer countries on fair terms.  ECONOMIC MIGRATION. Economic migrants have helped make Britain one of the richest countries in the world, both economically and culturally. There remains a positive economic benefit from managed immigration to fill the demand for skills and labour that are in short supply. We will consult with business and the public services to agree numbers of work permits for economic migration to make sure that Britain continues to prosper.  In Vince Cable, a former leading economist in industry, the Liberal Democrats have as Shadow Chancellor someone who can be relied on to make sure that every Liberal Democrat policy is affordable, and that economic policy delivers more stability and less red tape. This manifesto is realistic, costed, and deliverable  thats why it wins my support.  SUSAN KRAMER  FORMER INTERNATIONAL BANKER  Before entering parliament in 1983 I worked in business. The red tape, bureaucracy and wasteful rules were bad enough then. They are much worse today.  People running businesses up and down the country are the powerhouse of the economy. They need the freedom to generate economic growth  yet they are held back, struggling under a mountain of government rules, tax complications, bureaucracy and inspections.  So I have used my experience in business to make one thing sure above all else  that Liberal Democrat business policy is all about making things simpler, easier and fairer for businesses  particularly small businesses  to prosper and grow.  That means getting government off the back of business. For example, we will cut back the cost of business rates for small businesses. We will use sunset clauses to prevent unnecessary regulations imposing a burden on business long after their usefulness has passed. And we will get rid of the top-heavy old-style DTI industrial subsidies, investing instead in high-quality training so that young people have the skills employers want.  It also means a fairer playing field between small and large businesses  for example, by tackling the abuse of monopoly power through creating a duty to trade fairly. And where there is a need for government intervention, for example in tackling pollution, our promise is to harness market forces with incentives for sustainable development, so that good businesses pay less tax.  The business people I meet dont want subsidies, they just want government off their backs. They want government to deliver skills and infrastructure, not ever more red tape. They want the freedom to succeed. These are our ambitions too.  MALCOLM BRUCE  LIBERAL DEMOCRAT TRADE AND INDUSTRY SPOKESPERSON  BUSINESS  CUT THE RED TAPE THAT STOPS BUSINESSES FROM GROWING. Liberal Democrats will slash the red tape, bureaucracy and over-regulation that are holding British businesses  especially small businesses  back. We will start with these three measures:  - No new regulation will be passed until a full assessment of its costs and necessity is published.  - New regulations affecting business will automatically be scrapped unless Parliament specifically approves their renewal after a period specified in a sunset clause.  - Endless visits by all sorts of inspectors will be replaced in most cases by one all-purpose inspection.  INTRODUCE SMALL-BUSINESS RATE RELIEF. Many small businesses pay a disproportionate amount in rates  as much as 35 per cent of their profits. We will help small businesses by reforming the business rates system to allow firms with a rateable value of less than £25,000 to claim a business rate allowance of up to £1,500. This would represent a saving of over £600 a year for the majority of small businesses. We will also reform the valuation system to base rates on site values, rather than rental value, which penalises businesses that invest in improving their premises.  SCRAP THE DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND INDUSTRY. There is no need for a big department that interferes in the economy and subsidises failing companies at taxpayers expense. The DTI is irrelevant to most enterprises, so in abolishing it Liberal Democrats will cut away its bureaucratic and wasteful functions. We will transfer its useful roles to more appropriate departments, such as support for scientific research to our Department for Education, Skills and Science. The Chief Secretary to the Treasury will take on the role of advocate for business at the Cabinet table. Overall, this will save £8 billion of taxpayers money over the life of a parliament. We will invest this saving in our priorities, including improving education and training  which are of far more real benefit to business.  PROTECT CONSUMERS FROM RIP-OFFS. We will introduce a new legal duty on businesses to trade fairly, while cutting back unnecessary red tape and bureaucracy. Enforced by the courts, this will require less form-filling than Labours complex rules, yet provide more effective protection for consumers, and promote free competition.  BOOST TOURISM. We will promote domestic tourism opportunities, starting by creating an English Tourism Board to match those in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, with increased resources for marketing England. These measures will help reduce the tourism deficit  the difference between the amount spent by overseas visitors in the UK and the amount spent by UK tourists abroad  which has quadrupled under Labour and now stands at £17 billion.  GREEN ACTION:  USING ECONOMIC INSTRUMENTS TO BENEFIT THE ENVIRONMENT. Green tax reforms and traded permits should be used to encourage people to act in a more environmentally responsible way. We will change the Climate Change Levy into a Carbon Tax, making it more effective at discouraging the use of the polluting fuels and energy sources that harm the environment. We will also strengthen tax incentives to use smaller and less polluting vehicles and create more energy-efficient homes. We will launch a Treasury-led Environmental Incentive Programme, examining tax reforms that will reduce pollution and protect the environment, on the clear principle of taxing differently, not taxing more.  PROMOTE CLEAN ENERGY. Liberal Democrats will make sure that at least 20 per cent of the UKs electricity comes from a full range of renewable sources by the year 2020, by increasing and reforming the obligation on energy suppliers to use renewable energy. Liberal Democrats will not replace existing nuclear power stations as they come to the end of their safe and economic operating lives  instead we will use renewables and conserve energy. We will encourage the use of alternatives, such as hydrogen fuels, as technology develops.  It comes down to this: government needs to concentrate on its own job  delivering a stable, sustainable economy, a skilled workforce, and a modern infrastructure. It should only intervene in the market where it can show that the benefits clearly outweigh the costs. Regulation is a last resort. Red tape must be cut. In my experience this combination is unique to the Liberal Democrats.  IAIN VALLANCE  FORMER CHAIRMAN OF BT AND FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE CBI    Fair Pensions and Benefits  Every week I am contacted by people needing help with problems caused by the unfair and complex pensions and benefits system.  I receive letters from pensioners in poverty, struggling with unfair and demeaning means tests, or forced to pay for the care they need. I hear from women denied even the basic pension simply because they took time out of work to care for their children.  Then there are letters from people who want work to support themselves, fobbed off with government New Deal schemes that just dont give them the training and skills they need to get a job. Letters from workers who are angry that they have been robbed of their company pensions. Letters from people with severe disabilities who are at their wits end because of the bureaucracy and complexity of the benefits system.  We are all growing older. Anyone can be suddenly disabled. These days no job is for life. Everyone wants to know that there is a safety net if they, or their family, need it  but equally, no one wants to pay benefits to cheats, or keep people on the dole longer than necessary.  Yet, over and over again successive governments have just complicated the system, hitting decent people with unfair and demeaning means tests and sanctions, introducing computer systems that dont work  and yet have still failed to tackle the frauds effectively.  Before entering Parliament, I was Professor of Social Policy at Bath University, studying the mistakes governments kept making. Since being elected, I have sought to use my professional skills to develop alternatives that will work  plans that will guarantee everyone a decent old age, help when they are disabled or lose their job, and a decent start for every child. These principles of fairness and opportunity are close to the hearts of the British people, and are values held deeply by Liberal Democrats. In one of the richest countries in the world, we should not settle for less.  STEVE WEBB  LIBERAL DEMOCRAT SHADOW SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WORK AND PENSIONS   Pensions and Benefits  OVER £100 MORE ON THE PENSION EVERY MONTH AT 75  A MILLION PENSIONERS OFF MEANS-TESTING. Millions of elderly people are failing to receive the pensions theyve earned  and deserve and need  because of demeaning and unworkable means tests. Liberal Democrats will simplify the system, immediately guaranteeing a basic pension at 75 of at least £109.45 per week, with future increases linked to earnings. Thats over £100 a month more at 75 for every single pensioner. Every pensioner couple over 75 will receive at least £167.05 per week state pension  over £140 a month more than at present. This will abolish the need for means tests altogether for a million people.  CITIZENS PENSION. Many women who gave up work to bring up their children receive as little as a penny a week because they havent paid enough national insurance. From the age of 75 we will give pensioners our increased Citizens Pension as of right, making sure that 2.8 million women pensioners have security and dignity in retirement.  HELP PENSIONERS BY AXING THE COUNCIL TAX. Too often, pensioners are forced to pay huge Council Tax bills despite being on low incomes, and many will be faced with further massive increases due to revaluation. Replacing Council Tax with Local Income Tax means eight out of ten pensioners will be better off and six million poorer pensioners will pay no local tax at all. Unlike the other parties proposals, no one will be denied help simply because of their age or who they live with  everyone will only pay what they can afford.  HELP WORKING PARENTS SPEND MORE TIME WITH THEIR CHILDREN. Becoming a parent for the first time is a daunting and expensive task. Giving new working parents more support has benefits for them, their babies, their employers and the economy. Liberal Democrats will give working families having their first child increased maternity pay for the first six months at the rate of the minimum wage  thats £170 a week instead of £102.80 at present, a lot more just when parents really need it.  REFORM THE NEW DEAL TO GET MORE PEOPLE INTO WORK. The present New Deal leaves too many people on unnecessary or ineffective schemes rather than getting them into real jobs. Liberal Democrats will instead tailor the assistance so that jobseekers receive the package of support they need to get proper, permanent work. We will also scrap benefit sanctions which leave genuine claimants unable to feed and house themselves.  SCRAP THE CHILD SUPPORT AGENCY. The CSA is failing. Some parents are required to pay an unrealistic amount for maintenance, whilst other payments are never enforced. We would scrap the CSA and hand over its initial assessment and enforcement functions to the Inland Revenue so that payment is enforced fairly and effectively. Special circumstances would be addressed by appeal to a specialist tribunal able to take account of individual circumstances, instead of the present unfair rigid formula.  PROVIDE MORE SUPPORT FOR PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES. Many severely disabled people feel the cold intensely and cannot afford to heat their homes adequately, despite the fact that the cold will often make their conditions worse. We will help severely disabled people of working age with their fuel bills by giving them the same £200 a year Winter Fuel Payment that pensioners receive. We will also implement the recommendations of the Royal Commission on Long-Term Care to guarantee free personal care for people with disabilities who need it.  PRIVATE AND PUBLIC SECTOR PENSIONS. More than 60,000 workers worked for companies that have gone out of business leaving insufficient money in their pension funds. We will bolster the governments compensation scheme to make sure that these workers are compensated at the same level available under the new Pension Protection Fund. Unlike Labour, we will give proper time for consultation before making changes to existing public sector pension schemes, and we will honour the entitlements already built up.  BEATING FRAUD AND ERROR. Each year, around £3 billion is lost to the taxpayer due to fraud and error in the social security system  £100 for every taxpayer every year. The new tax credits could add a further £1.6 billion to that loss. We will reverse the spread of mass means-testing, simplify the benefits and tax credit system, and extend fraud prevention and detection activities to all benefits, reducing both fraud and error.  Green Action:  SAVE ENERGY AND CUT FUEL BILLS. Thousands of people  mostly pensioners  die each year from preventable cold-related illnesses. On average, around fifty people die unnecessarily in each constituency every year. Poor home insulation and poor-quality housing lead to cold homes and high fuel bills, the main causes of this fuel poverty, while the average pensioner household spends £500 a year on energy. We will help pensioners and severely disabled people cut this bill by allowing them to take a years Winter Fuel Payment as a voucher redeemable against insulation and energy saving materials. These would be made available at about half price through a partnership with fuel suppliers. A pensioner could save more than £100 from their energy bill every year by investing just one years Winter Fuel Payment, and help the environment as well. In this way we will invest in cutting energy use and at the same time help pensioners and severely disabled people stay warm and save money.  I am appalled that in the fourth richest country in the world, so many pensioners, particularly older women, are trapped in so much poverty. I left the Labour Party and joined the Liberal Democrats four years ago because the more I saw Labour failing in action, the more I realised it was time to face the truth: that the Liberal Democrats are now the only party I can trust to deliver the decent pensions, and above all the free care when its needed, to guarantee everyone dignity and security in retirement.  CLAIRE RAYNER  PRESIDENT OF THE PATIENTS ASSOCIATION AND MEMBER OF THE ROYAL COMMISSION ON LONG-TERM CARE FOR THE ELDERLY  STRONG LOCAL COMMUNITIES  Villages, towns, cities, counties  we all live in communities. As local people, we know whats good in our own community  and whats bad. When things go wrong, we want them put right, and to hold those in charge to account if theyre not.  When local democracy works, the people taking decisions are people who actually use their local schools or hospitals, and care about them. They are locally elected people, who earn your trust when they get it right, or are thrown out if they get it wrong.  Yet successive Conservative and Labour governments have stripped power from local communities. Ministers and officials in Whitehall take all the key decisions now, over the heads of local doctors, police chiefs or head teachers  without ever visiting the schools, hospitals or police stations that are so precious to their communities.  Worse still, theyve imposed an unfair tax system for all this. The Council Tax was dreamt up by the Conservatives, but Labour has made it even worse, with bills rocketing. Its just not right to force people on incomes as low as £12,000 a year to hand over an average of a thousand pounds or more in Council Tax. Now millions are threatened with huge further increases in Council Tax if Labour and Conservative plans to revalue our homes and change the Council Tax bands go ahead  its already hit Wales.  Meanwhile more and more young people cant even afford a home and the number of homeless families is at a record high. While the Conservatives sold off affordable homes, Labour cut the numbers being built. Thats why Im so determined to help create new opportunities for people to afford their first home.  It makes no sense to me that local decisions are taken by distant bureaucrats or politicians who dont know local services, and will never use them. And I will never accept that local taxes should impoverish families and pensioners, or that millions should be unable to afford a decent home. Its time to cut the Whitehall red tape and absurd rules. Bring in a fair system for paying for local services. Help and encourage voluntary initiatives, such as social enterprises and local credit unions. In other words, its time to trust local communities to take their own decisions again.  EDWARD DAVEY  LIBERAL DEMOCRAT SHADOW SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE OFFICE OF THE DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER   Local Communities  AXE THE UNFAIR COUNCIL TAX  LOCAL INCOME TAX IS FAIR AND AFFORDABLE. On top of the Chancellors plans to increase Council Tax yet again, Council Tax revaluation in England in 2007 threatens one in three households with huge and arbitrary rises, as is already happening in Wales. The Council Tax penalises pensioners and people on low incomes, who pay a far higher proportion of their income in Council Tax than the very rich. A Local Income Tax is based very simply on the ability to pay. It would be run through the existing Inland Revenue Income Tax mechanism, so saving hundreds of millions of pounds by abolishing Council Tax administration. The typical household will save around £450 per year, and eight out of ten pensioners will have lower bills.  AFFORDABLE HOMES. We will help tackle the affordable housing crisis by making available public sector land currently owned by the Ministry of Defence, the Department of Health and English Partnerships, sufficient to build 100,000 more homes both for rent and for affordable purchase through shared ownership schemes for local people. We will reform VAT to encourage developers to repair and reuse empty buildings and brownfield land, rather than building on greenfields and eroding the countryside. We will take 150,000 homebuyers a year out of paying stamp duty altogether, by raising the threshold to £150,000. In areas where second homes are overwhelming the local housing market, we will require people to get planning permission before turning another full-time home into a holiday home.  ART, HERITAGE AND SPORT. Liberal Democrats have a proud tradition of championing the arts, culture and heritage, which successive governments have undervalued. This Governments move towards greater state interference in the arts has threatened to stifle artistic freedom. We will restore the National Lottery funds independence, requiring the Department for Culture, Media and Sport to separate clearly government spending from independently determined Lottery spending in its annual reports. We will end Labours freeze in the core Arts Council budget, guaranteeing that growth in core arts funding at least matches inflation. We will help protect the built environment by reducing VAT on historic building repairs. We will increase grassroots sports funding, and support the UKs 2012 Olympic and Paralympic bid.  SET COMMUNITIES FREE FROM WHITEHALL. We will free local councils from many of the stifling controls of central government so that they can innovate and deliver services that meet local peoples real needs. Councils will become genuinely accountable to their local communities rather than being agents of Whitehall. To cut bureaucracy and increase effectiveness we would go much further than Labour or the Tories to cut the burden of inspections, merging eight government inspectorates into one, a streamlined and independent Audit Commission.  PROTECT THE POST OFFICE NETWORK AND UNIVERSAL MAIL DELIVERY. Over 3,500 post offices have closed under Labour, and hundreds more are due to be axed. Thousands also closed under the Conservatives. Our priority is to secure a viable future for the post office network, by developing a business plan based on providing a combination of commercial services, benefits transactions and government information. This will help keep more post offices open. We will maintain the obligation on Royal Mail to provide universal same-price delivery of letters throughout the UK.  Green Action:  TACKLE WASTE. Liberal Democrats will set a long-term goal of zero municipal waste, through waste minimisation, reuse and recycling. As a first step, we will make sure that within seven years 60 per cent of all household waste is recycled and we will aim to offer every household regular kerbside recycling. Manufacturers will be held responsible for disposing of their products and materials that are difficult to reuse or recycle. We will not allow new incinerators for municipal waste unless they can be shown to be the best environmental option after considering all alternatives, including new technologies where waste reduction and reuse are not possible.  PLANNING FOR SUSTAINABILITY. We will reform the planning system to make sure that local authority development plans are sustainable. That means incorporating targets for CO~2~ emission reductions to encourage the development of renewable energy facilities, and accounting for the climate change consequences of policies, including transport. We will also use building regulations to improve the environmental quality of new buildings.  In the nineteenth century Liberals used local democracy to transform our cities, delivering for the first time clean water and sewerage, public health and education, power and transport. In the twenty-first century, we need to strip away central government red tape and unelected quangos, and set communities free again, to reinvigorate local services on the front-line, and to hold those responsible properly accountable.  SIMON HUGHES  PRESIDENT OF THE LIBERAL DEMOCRATS   Britains Place in Europe and the World  It is often said that foreign affairs is not a determining issue in UK elections. But on this occasion I believe that the conduct of Britains foreign affairs, particularly in relation to Iraq, goes right to the heart of the Labour Governments credibility.  Both at home and abroad trust has been eroded, and Britains reputation diminished. It need not have been so. Britain, as a member of the G8, the Security Council of the United Nations, the European Union, NATO and the Commonwealth, has a unique opportunity to be a force for good in the world. British practice has been one of operating through multilateral institutions  and experience shows that when Britain does this, it provides leadership and influence.  But Britain was taken to war against Iraq without express UN authority and on a flawed prospectus. The Government built its case on unreliable intelligence, in circumstances of doubtful legality. Who would have thought that Labour would lead the country into a war which has been compared to the fiasco of Suez?  This must never be allowed to happen again. The work of rebuilding trust and confidence should begin immediately. We can start by committing ourselves to the reforms of the United Nations set out in the High-Level Panels sagacious report. We can influence the whole of the Middle East by an unwavering commitment to peace between Israel and the Palestinians. We can sharpen the focus on assistance for the poorest countries in the world through aid, debt relief and trade. We can pursue the cause of human rights wherever they are abused and neglected.  We can truly put ourselves at the heart of Europe and at the heart of its reform. We can make sure that British arms exports neither encourage conflict nor assist repression. We can fashion a new relationship with the United States: a partnership of influence, not one of uncritical subordination. We can base foreign policy on liberal values, respect for the rule of law, and human rights.  I believe that only in this way can we maximise Britains influence, and restore Britains reputation.  SIR MENZIES CAMPBELL  LIBERAL DEMOCRAT SHADOW FOREIGN SECRETARY    INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS    WE SHOULD NOT HAVE GONE TO WAR IN IRAQ. There were no weapons of mass destruction, there was no serious and current threat, and inspectors were denied the time they needed to finish their job. Thousands of soldiers and civilians have been killed and it has cost the UK over £3.5 billion. Britain must never again support an illegal military intervention. But by invading Iraq the Government has imposed on us a moral obligation to work towards a stable, secure and free Iraq. We welcome the recent elections. We will seek to strengthen and enlarge Iraqi security forces so that they can assume greater responsibility, include Sunni leaders in the political process, and ensure adequate provision of food, water, sanitation and health care for all the Iraqi people. We will support the transition to a fully democratic and legitimate government, aiming to withdraw British troops by the expiry of the UN mandate at the end of the year; the open-ended presence of coalition forces is destabilising and fuels the insurgency.  BUILD SECURITY AT HOME AND ABROAD. The best way to achieve security and to tackle the threat from terrorism is through international action. Britain must work through the United Nations, as a committed member of the EU, and with the US to promote international law, democracy and respect for human rights. We will work to reform the UN and the EU to make them more responsive to international challenges.  EUROPE  MAKE EUROPE MORE EFFECTIVE AND DEMOCRATIC. Membership of the EU has been hugely important for British jobs, environmental protection, equality rights, and Britains place in the world. But with enlargement to twenty-five member states, the EU needs reform to become more efficient and more accountable. The new constitution helps to achieve this by improving EU coherence, strengthening the powers of the elected European Parliament compared to the Council of Ministers, allowing proper oversight of the unelected Commission, and enhancing the role of national parliaments. It also more clearly defines and limits the powers of the EU, reflecting diversity and preventing over-centralisation. We are therefore clear in our support for the constitution, which we believe is in Britains interest  but ratification must be subject to a referendum of the British people.  The other parties like to posture. We think its time for common sense. In the modern world, Britain is more prosperous and secure in Europe. But we need to make Europe work more effectively  through more democracy, more openness, less waste, and less bureaucracy. Thats our Liberal Democrat vision for a strong Britain in a strong Europe, a powerful voice in the world.  SAJJAD KARIM AND FIONA HALL  LIBERAL DEMOCRAT MEMBERS OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT  DEFENCE  OUR TROOPS PROTECT THE NATION  WE MUST PROTECT THEM. Britains armed forces protect the country and are a force for good in the world. But with increasing overseas commitments, they are overstretched. The Government should not be cutting the size of the armed forces while at the same time asking them to take on ever more difficult tasks. New equipment continues to arrive late and over-budget, so we will make military procurement more open and competitive. By switching funding from unnecessary programmes, for example by cutting the third tranche of the Eurofighter programme, we will be able to invest more in protecting the welfare of the armed forces, ensuring that they are well-trained and well-equipped. We will seek new ways of sharing the military burden, by working with allies through NATO and the EU. Liberal Democrats will be realistic about what Britain can, and should, take on, and British forces must always be able to deal with emergencies at home, such as terrorism or natural disasters.  WORK FOR THE ELIMINATION OF NUCLEAR WEAPONS AND TACKLE THE ARMS TRADE. We will press for a new round of multilateral arms reduction talks, retaining the UKs current minimum nuclear deterrent for the foreseeable future, until sufficient progress has been made towards the global elimination of such weapons. Arms sales contribute to conflict, so we will establish a cross-party Parliamentary Arms Export Committee to monitor arms exports and scrutinise individual licence applications. We will require arms brokers to register under a code of conduct and revoke the licences of those who break the code. We will support the establishment of an International Arms Trade Treaty.    INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT   Liberal Democrat international development policy is built on two foundations. First, we believe that this country has the wealth to help those much poorer than ourselves, and should do so. Second, we believe that we all benefit from achievement of sustainable development in the poorest countries in the world.  This country has never lived up to the promise it made long ago to devote 0.7 per cent of its annual income to aid; it is time that it did. The response of the British people to the Asian tsunami disaster was extraordinarily generous  but every day millions of families around the world are caught up in similar tragedies of famine, drought, war and terrible poverty. So it is time Britain lived up to its promises, to build the sustainable development to end such poverty once and for all.  But it is not just about aid. For example, opening European markets to the products of the poorest countries helps their economies and lifts them out of poverty. Stopping subsidised European food being dumped helps their farmers prosper and grow more. Neither policy would cost a penny.  We need to reform international institutions to make them more responsive to developing country needs; make aid more productive; make trade fairer; and take action to promote good governance, the rule of law and human rights.  The people of this country have an outstanding record of helping those in need around the world. It is time for our government to match their commitment.  TOM BRAKE  LIBERAL DEMOCRAT SHADOW SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT  MEET BRITAINS PROMISE ON AID. Liberal Democrats are committed to realising a world free from poverty. In order to achieve the UN Millennium Development Goals by 2015 (which include tackling extreme poverty and hunger, providing universal primary education, and combating HIV/AIDS) the UK needs to provide more effective international assistance. Liberal Democrats will increase British aid spending from 0.35 per cent of Gross National Income today to at least 0.5 per cent by 2007/08, and set out detailed plans for it to reach 0.7 per cent by 2011 at the latest.  FAIR AND SUSTAINABLE TRADE AND INVESTMENT. Working through the EU and the World Trade Organisation, we will seek to remove the subsidies and tariff barriers that prevent the poorest countries in the world selling their goods on fair terms. We will work to end the dumping of subsidised agricultural exports by developed economies which is wrecking farming in Africa and other parts of the world. We will work to make sure that agreements to liberalise new sectors proceed on a genuinely voluntary basis, without undue pressure on developing countries. We will require companies benefiting from open markets to behave responsibly, and we will promote a new international agreement to encourage investment, particularly in the poorest countries.  Green Action:  PROMOTE ENVIRONMENTALLY SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT. We will make sure that development assistance, whether delivered from the UK, EU, or multilateral institutions, not only meets the needs of the poor, but does so in ways that contribute to environmental sustainability. This means, in particular, targeting aid on renewable energy, clean water and sustainable agriculture, and increasing market access for green products from the developing world. We will devote resources to protecting biodiversity in developing countries, where many species of rare plants and wildlife are seriously endangered.  TAKE EFFECTIVE ACTION TO PROTECT THE GLOBAL ENVIRONMENT. We will work through the EU to promote effective and enforceable international agreements to protect the global environment, such as the Cartagena Protocol (on GM products). We will support international agreements and activities designed to stop international environmental crime, such as illegal logging or illegal trade in endangered wildlife, and improve customs training to tackle these illegal activities more effectively. We will argue for reforms of the World Trade Organisation, World Bank and International Monetary Fund to make sure that trade and development policies support rather than hinder environmental sustainability.  PUT BRITAIN AT THE FOREFRONT OF CLIMATE CHANGE NEGOTIATIONS. Catastrophic climate change is the major environmental threat to the planet. Urgent action is needed. Liberal Democrat plans will make sure that Britain achieves its targets from the Kyoto Protocol (the international agreement on the pollution that causes climate change) well before the deadline. Britain and the EU must take the lead on negotiations for the next set of targets for greenhouse gas emissions. It is vital that we include the US and Australia but we also need to work with developing countries. Our long-term goal is contraction and convergence  which means agreeing for every country a sustainable population-related allowance for emissions.  A FAIRER DEAL FOR RURAL COMMUNITIES  Successive governments  it didnt just start with Labour  have failed rural Britain.  Until about a decade ago the majority of rural communities were traditionally Conservative, but under Conservative governments thousands of rural schools, post offices, police stations and other rural services and facilities were closed or withdrawn. Much council housing was sold off and local working families found themselves unable to find an affordable home in many communities.  The Conservatives mishandling of the BSE crisis has cost the country dearly. The Conservatives also saw UK fishermen as expendable when negotiating entry to the Common Fisheries Policy, which left both fish stocks and fishermen hopelessly under-protected.  But under Labour things have gone from bad to worse. Record numbers of farmers have left farming altogether. Labour has failed to stem the continuing decline in local services and the lack of affordable accommodation. The unfair funding systems introduced by the Conservatives, which penalise health, education and police in rural areas, have worsened under Labour.  I and my family come from a background of farming and fishing in my constituency. But I do not believe that you need to have been born and brought up in a rural way of life to recognise that the Conservatives represent a countryside for the privileged few, whilst Labour are completely out of touch with rural needs and way of life. It is no coincidence that Liberal Democrat MPs represent many of the most rural constituencies in the country.  I came into parliament to champion the people who live in the kind of rural communities I grew up in and now represent. Our manifesto offers a fair deal  at last  for Britain's rural communities.  ANDREW GEORGE  LIBERAL DEMOCRAT SHADOW SECRETARY OF STATE FOR RURAL AFFAIRS AND FOOD    RURAL AFFAIRS  FAIR PRICES FOR FOOD. Of every pound consumers spend on food in supermarkets just eight pence goes to the farmer. Liberal Democrats will introduce a legal duty to trade fairly, supported by a Food Trade Inspector within the Office of Fair Trading. This will protect farmers and consumers from unfair practices by supermarkets and processing companies.  SPEED UP REFORM OF THE COMMON AGRICULTURAL POLICY. The CAP fails to protect the interests of rural communities, family farms and the environment. We will press within the EU to speed up reform so that the public funding available is used to provide public benefits. These should include improved access and environmental protection, support for traditional farming and organic systems and new opportunities for agricultural products and local markets. We will use the UKs CAP flexibility to support family farms and aid new entrants more effectively.  SAVE THE UKS FISH AND MARINE ENVIRONMENT. We will seek early further reform of the Common Fisheries Policy to give local fishermen and other stakeholders a real say in the management of their own regional waters. We will introduce a Marine Act to create a marine planning system to resolve problems of conflicting uses of the sea and sea bed. This would establish conservation zones for highly sensitive areas and strengthen protection of commercial fish stocks, dolphins, porpoises and other endangered marine wildlife.  IMPROVE ANIMAL WELFARE. Liberal Democrats will establish an Animal Protection Commission, bringing all animal welfare matters under the responsibility of a dedicated, expert body, with the duty to make sure that animal protection laws are properly enforced and kept up to date. We will introduce a new Animal Welfare Act to guarantee high standards of animal welfare across the board for farm livestock, working animals and domestic pets, and will close the loophole in existing legislation which allows people who have been banned from keeping animals still to own them if someone else has custody.  Green Action:  NO COMMERCIAL GM CROPS UNLESS WE KNOW THEYRE SAFE FOR THE ENVIRONMENT. We support the right of communities to create GM-free zones. We will insist on rigorous schemes of labelling and traceability in food to guarantee consumer choice. At the same time we will introduce measures to promote organic farming.  I am passionate about the beauty of our landscape, and the communities who live within it. The policies throughout this manifesto are about protecting the environment and re-invigorating local services, proving to me that the Liberal Democrats are the only party that genuinely shares my concern  the real party of the countryside.  KATE PARMINTER  FORMER CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF THE CAMPAIGN FOR THE PROTECTION OF RURAL ENGLAND  GETTING BRITAIN MOVING  Good transport in all forms is vital to a successful economy  yet governments, both Tory and Labour, have failed to deliver it. The Tories created the mess the countrys in, particularly with their privatisation of the railways. Labour promised to get Britain moving again, but have only made things worse. Promises to cut traffic have failed to materialise, and fewer trains arrive on time.  Like me, the British people know that things cant go on like this. We need a government that will take these problems seriously. One which accepts both that transport needs to work and that it must live within its environmental means. Any strategy which does not recognise these self-evident truths is doomed to failure.  I live in one of the most rural constituencies in the country. Here the car is a necessity, not a luxury. But when I am in Westminster, public transport is a much more convenient way of getting about. It is blindingly obvious that the same solutions dont apply in both areas.  So we need to be more creative. Our ideas for transport are all about responding to differing local needs, and helping people do the right things for the environment, rather than just taxing everyone more. We need to provide better public transport alternatives wherever possible, and we need a charging regime for car use  not ownership  which reflects both congestion and need.  Small local changes can make a big difference. Liberal Democrats are campaigning up and down the country to re-open railway stations and lines. Making stations safer wont cost much, but it will mean that people feel more secure and will be more likely to travel by rail.   I cant guarantee that every train will always run on time  but I can guarantee that a Liberal Democrat government will work to get Britain moving again.  JOHN THURSO  LIBERAL DEMOCRAT SECRETARY OF STATE FOR TRANSPORT   Transport  MAKE THE RAILWAYS WORK AGAIN. Conservative privatisation left the railways in a mess, but Labour hasnt solved the problems. Whilst delays have doubled, bureaucracy has increased fivefold, while services are being cut. Liberal Democrats will streamline the system, with fewer, larger franchises, given longer contracts in return for more investment and better services. We will use savings from the roads budget to prioritise safety at stations, and to restore the key rail upgrades postponed or cancelled under Labour.  REWARD OWNERS OF LESS POLLUTING CARS WITH LOWER TAXES. For many people, particularly in rural areas, cars are a necessity and cannot be replaced by public transport. But they can be far less damaging to the environment when they use less fuel or alternative fuels. We will start by reforming the Vehicle Excise Duty system (road tax) to cut tax altogether on cars that pollute least, funded by increasing it on those that pollute more. Congestion charging in London (first proposed by the Liberal Democrats) has cut pollution, cut traffic jams and paid for new investment in buses. We will encourage more cities and towns where traffic congestion is a problem to extend congestion charging, linked to up-front investment in better public transport to give millions real alternatives to the car and to reduce the need to drive. In the longer term, as technology allows, we will scrap petrol duties and VED altogether, replacing the revenue with a national road user charging system based on location, congestion and pollution (including the level of pollution of the particular vehicle). As a result, pollution and congestion will be better targeted, with no need for the present system of heavy taxes on every journey.  FREE OFF-PEAK LOCAL BUS TRAVEL FOR ALL PENSIONERS AND DISABLED PEOPLE. Liberal Democrats were the first to make the case for giving all pensioners and disabled people free off-peak local bus travel, and have already done so in Scotland and Wales. We will implement this policy, and we will in addition provide all pensioners, disabled people, families and young people with their rail discount cards free.  CUT LORRY TRAFFIC, REDUCE POLLUTION, AND MAKE TOWNS AND VILLAGES SAFER. In office, Labour has now increased road building, while the Conservatives plans would concrete over an area half the size of London with new roads. Both their approaches mean more traffic and pollution, not less. We will not proceed with major new road-building schemes unless the benefits are clear, including environmental and safety factors and a full assessment of alternative public transport schemes. Resources switched from the roads programme will be used to increase investment in public transport, and we will promote safer cycle and pedestrian routes throughout towns and cities. In addition, we will encourage the development of freight interchanges to facilitate growth in rail freight, and we will develop a shipping, ports and waterways strategy.  REFORM AVIATION TAXES. To encourage more fuel-efficient aircraft and discourage half-empty planes we will press for international agreement on extending emissions trading to aviation, while at the same time implementing per-aircraft rather than per-passenger charges. We will oppose the construction of international airports on new sites, and also the expansion of airports in the South East. We will end the regulation on busy national airports which results in retail rents subsidising landing charges and encouraging congestion and pollution. We will protect essential lifeline routes to remote UK communities.  GREEN ACTION:  GREEN TRANSPORT POLICIES. All our transport policies are designed to encourage more environmental transport options, including cutting the cost of using more environmentally friendly vehicles, boosting public transport, discouraging heavily polluting vehicles and reforming aviation policies to cut emissions.  Like everyone else who drives a car, takes a train or uses the tube  as I do twice a day  I suffer week-in week-out the mess Conservative and Labour governments have made of public transport in this country. More and more traffic congestion destroys quality of life and wrecks the environment, whilst train services are ever more crowded and unreliable. Simply put, Liberal Democrats will help people get from A to B safely without undue delay, and without wrecking the environment.  LYNNE FEATHERSTONE  CHAIR OF THE GREATER LONDON ASSEMBLY TRANSPORT COMMITTEE  STOP THE ABUSE OF POWER  Every time you open a newspaper or see the news, the government seems to be taking more power for itself, and in particular for the Prime Minister.  It started with Mrs. Thatcher. It has got worse since Tony Blair became Prime Minister. His Policy Unit at No. 10 Downing Street tells ministers what to do. His Cabinet no longer makes the key decisions; he does. The House of Commons is no longer supreme; it is treated as a rubber-stamp, rather than as the peoples representatives to whom government is accountable.  Local councils are controlled by centrally imposed rules and regulations, or by-passed by government-appointed boards and quangos. I remember the remarkable record of great towns and counties in the past, and the pride local people felt in them. Why does the government so undermine them?  Professional men and women, like doctors, teachers and nurses are constantly told by the government exactly what they should do. The blizzard of orders and directives is relentless. Today we have the nanny state with a vengeance.  Yet the Government does not have a popular majority for what it is doing. Even in 2001, the last election, only four out of ten voters supported it. If Britain had a fair voting system, Labour would never have had its current huge majority of parliamentary seats.  I have served in parliament for thirty years, nearly twenty in the Commons and ten in the Lords. I have never felt so worried about the safety of British democracy. It is being eroded bit by bit. Only the opposition parties in the House of Lords, and some independent cross-benchers, saved the country from a regime of detention without trial, determined not by judges but by ministers. Up to now, that kind of behaviour only happened in tyrannies like Pinochets Chile, or Verwoerds South Africa.  The arrogant abuse of power must be stopped, by restoring cabinet government, protecting the independence of civil servants, giving greater power to local government, and ensuring that parliament has the time to do its crucial job of holding the executive to account.  Liberties, once lost, are rarely restored. The freedom of the individual lies at the heart of liberal democracy, and we Liberal Democrats are determined to defend it.  SHIRLEY WILLIAMS  FORMER LIBERAL DEMOCRAT LEADER IN THE HOUSE OF LORDS   Better Government  CURB THE POWER OF THE PRIME MINISTER. In recent decades Prime Ministers have exercised a growing domination over the political system, insufficiently accountable to Parliament or the people. We will curb this excessive concentration of power. We will cut back the powers of patronage, in particular through our plans for a predominantly elected second chamber. We will make the Royal Prerogative powers which the Prime Minister exercises  such as decisions over war and peace  subject to parliamentary accountability, including bringing in a War Powers Act to require parliaments authority before a government takes Britain to war. A Civil Service Act will introduce a barrier to politicisation of the civil service. We will also strengthen the powers of parliament to scrutinise the actions of the government, enhancing the Select Committee system.  CUT BACK CENTRAL GOVERNMENT. We will cut the excessive number of government departments and reduce the number of government ministers by over a third. We will also move government bureaucracy out of London, saving money on office rents and spreading wealth and jobs more equally through the UK. The savings will be ploughed back into better public services.  MORE POWER FOR LOCAL COMMUNITIES. Our priority is to make local services, like health and education, work better for people. That means that local communities need to have more influence and say over the major issues affecting them. So we will strengthen local democracy, taking power down from Whitehall and reducing central interference and the burden of inspection. The powers of many unelected regional and national quangos and administrators will be given to local cities and counties, including returning to County Councils their strategic planning role. The healthcare planning role of Primary Care Trusts will be given to elected local social services authorities. We will streamline remaining regional functions into a single agency, increasing accountability to the local community through an executive comprising councillors elected from the cities and counties, rather than appointed by the Secretary of State. Underpinning these reforms will be a new system for dividing up government funding fairly within the UK, so that the system is fair for the nations and regions according to their real needs.  A MORE DEMOCRATIC BRITAIN. Liberal Democrats will improve and strengthen the UKs democratic systems. Liberal Democrats in government in Scotland are already bringing in the single transferable vote (STV) system for local elections, so that local councillors will genuinely represent their community. We will extend this fair voting system to all local elections in Britain, and to the House of Commons, Scottish Parliament and National Assembly for Wales. At the age people can marry, leave school and start work, they will have the right to vote. We will review the European electoral system so people can choose their MEPs personally, rather than just vote by party list as at present. Reform of the House of Lords has been botched by Labour, leaving it unelected and even more in the patronage of the Prime Minister. We will replace it with a predominantly elected second chamber.  BETTER GOVERNMENT IN THE NATIONS OF THE UK. Liberal Democrats have led the way in arguing for devolution to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. We believe that people in those parts of the UK, rather than the government in London, should take the decisions on issues that affect them directly. We will therefore strengthen the powers of the Northern Ireland Assembly and extend primary legislative powers to the National Assembly for Wales. In consultation with the Scottish Parliament, we will consider how to extend its role.  MAKE THE BBC MORE INDEPENDENT FROM GOVERNMENT. The BBC has, over the last eighty years, made a major contribution to Britains democracy, culture and standing in the world. The Liberal Democrats will make sure it remains the worlds leading public service broadcaster  strong, independent, and securely funded. But the regulation of the BBC has been insufficiently independent of its own management, and of the government. Labours proposals fail to address this. Liberal Democrats will scrap the current government-appointed Board of Governors, and introduce a new, independent external regulator appointed by parliament, to make sure that all public service broadcasters live up to their obligations to the public.  GREEN ACTION:  MAKE GOVERNMENT TAKE THE ENVIRONMENT SERIOUSLY. It is vital that government and business are made to take their environmental obligations seriously. We will strengthen reporting obligations for government and business as part of an Environmental Responsibility Act, holding government as well as business to account. We will use the purchasing power of government to boost the market for green products and services. We will unite those areas of government with the biggest impact on the environment in a single Environment, Transport and Energy department.  Since being elected to parliament I have been appalled by how unrepresentative it is and how easily it has been manipulated by the Government, culminating in Blair taking Britain to war on a false premise. Thats why Liberal Democrats will curb the power of the Prime Minister. And well introduce a fair voting system, so that parliament better represents the views of Britain and better reflects its diversity - with more women and a greater proportion of ethnic minority MPs.  SANDRA GIDLEY  LIBERAL DEMOCRAT SPOKESPERSON FOR WOMEN  THE LIBERAL DEMOCRAT PLEDGE FOR GREEN ACTION  Catastrophic climate change is the greatest man-made threat to the planet, leading to fertile plains turning to desert, extreme weather conditions, rising sea levels, the spread of diseases and water shortages. These are not distant threats  in particular, the UK is likely to become much more vulnerable to flooding and tropical diseases such as malaria. Yet governments here and abroad have lamentably failed to rise to the challenge.  Conservative and Labour politicians have preferred short-term popularity to taking the tough decisions for the long term. This year, the Labour Government actually decided to raise the UK ceiling for emissions of the greenhouse gases that are causing climate change, and the environment does not even feature on Labours pledge card. Sometimes it feels like the Prime Minister is just too close to George Bush.  I stood for Parliament after years as an environmental campaigner, because I realised that it was only possible to change what the government does by changing the politicians. Otherwise ministers would go on saying they cared, but doing nothing. The Liberal Democrats can be trusted to make that change  thats why I joined them.  My daughter is now five years old. I want her future to be bright  not destroyed before it really starts because the present generation has failed to take action. It is time the government helped people to make the changes needed  changes that can cut energy and other bills as well as protect the worlds future. It is time for a government that takes the environment seriously  before it is too late.  Thats why the environment features on every page of this manifesto  a strong green thread running through everything we do and promise.  NORMAN BAKER  LIBERAL DEMOCRAT SHADOW SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE ENVIRONMENT  Concern for the environment has always been a core Liberal Democrat value. Our policies are focused on three main areas:  - TACKLE CLIMATE CHANGE. Catastrophic climate change is the major environmental threat to the planet. Urgent action is needed. Liberal Democrat plans will make sure that Britain achieves its targets from the Kyoto Protocol (the international agreement on the pollution that causes climate change) well before the deadline. Britain and the EU must take the lead on negotiations for the next set of targets for greenhouse gas emissions. It is vital that we include the US and Australia but we also need to work with developing countries. Our long-term goal is contraction and convergence  which means agreeing for every country a sustainable population-related allowance for emissions.  - CLEANER TRANSPORT AND ENVIRONMENT. Pollution and congestion have a major impact on peoples health and quality of life, as well as on climate change. Many of the solutions to these problems involve transport and this document includes plans to promote public transport, especially the railways. However, pollution can also be cut by reducing domestic waste and promoting recycling. Pioneering Liberal Democrat controlled local authorities are leading the way in cutting unnecessary waste and we will expand these practices nationally.  - CLEANER POWER. Energy use is the main source of greenhouse gas emissions and hazardous waste. We will introduce measures to reduce energy use overall  for example through better home insulation which will also tackle the fuel poverty faced in particular by pensioners. We will make sure that at least 20 per cent of the UKs electricity derives from a range of renewable sources by the year 2020. Finally, given their long-term problems of cost, pollution and safety, we will not replace existing nuclear power stations as they reach the end of their safe and economic operating lives. We will use renewables and save energy instead.  I joined the Liberal Party twenty-five years ago because they were fighting a local Tory plan to create towering rubbish dumps close to peoples homes  action speaks louder than words. Now the world faces catastrophic climate change, our commitment to the environment has never mattered more.  SUE DOUGHTY  LIBERAL DEMOCRAT SHADOW MINISTERIAL SPOKESPERSON, DEFRA (ENVIRONMENT)  10 GOOD REASONS TO  VOTE LIBERAL DEMOCRAT  WE OPPOSE: Putting targets first  WE PROPOSE: Putting patients first  WE OPPOSE: Tuition fees & Top-up fees  WE PROPOSE: Scrapping student fees  WE OPPOSE: Compulsory I.D.

"Conservatives",200505,"ARE YOU THINKING WHAT WE'RE THINKING?  IT'S TIME FOR ACTION  THE BRITISH DREAM  I BELIEVE that Britain could be doing so much better.  Our country has everything going for it. Creative flair, world-beating companies, globally-respected universities, a tradition of tolerance, a love of freedom, a talent for enterprise, a concern for the underdog and the ability to pull together in a crisis.  Britain is a great country. But today it is heading in the wrong direction. Far too many people are held back from achieving their full potential. A thousand everyday frustrations prevent the British people from living fulfilled lives.  Conservatives know that governments don't have all the answers. But if they govern with the right values, they can make a real difference. Today, Britain is being governed with the wrong values.  Instead of rewarding families who do the right thing, work hard and pay their taxes, Mr Blair's Government takes them for granted. And after eight years in power, all he offers is more talk.  Meanwhile, people worry about infections they might catch in hospitals which are dirty when they should be clean. Parents worry about their children not learning to read and write properly in classrooms which are unruly, not disciplined. In too many communities it is responsible citizens, not criminals and yobs, who walk in fear. Our out-of-control immigration system encourages people smugglers and penalises genuine refugees. And all this has happened despite huge, stealthy increases in taxation.  So long as this continues, the people of this country are deprived of the chance to be all they can be. They shouldn't have to settle for this.  At this election there is a chance for us to be optimistic about our future again. People have been let down by a Government that has lost touch with them. On May 5th they can elect a Government that focuses on the things that matter. A Government that acts - and delivers results. A Government that does exactly what it says.  We will be ambitious for our country - a Conservative Government will aspire to give everyone the chance to make the most of their lives. We will govern on behalf of the forgotten majority and their values, the people who make up the backbone of our country: people who work hard; save to buy their first home; take responsibility for their families. People who do the right thing should be rewarded, not punished.  We will extend choice - a Conservative Government will give individuals more control over their own money and over the public services we all depend on.  We will devolve power from the centre to our communities - a Conservative Government will trust professionals and enable parents and patients to shape services according to their needs.  We will secure the foundations of a successful and decent society - a Conservative Government will tilt the balance of the justice system in favour of the victim, and will restore control of our borders. We will settle our relationship with the European Union by bringing powers back from Brussels to Britain.  The British people should feel confident that they can get on with their lives while their Government concentrates on tackling the practical problems which matter to them. That is why a Conservative Government will be focused on cleaner hospitals, school discipline, more police, controlled immigration and lower taxes.  I'm in politics to give something back to the country which gave so much to me. As the child of immigrants, as a state school pupil, as the first person in my family to go to university, I am driven by a profound sense of pride in Britain.  For me the heart of politics is all about people - their hopes and aspirations. People want the freedom, security and opportunity to get on in life.  They want the freedom to take the important decisions about their families and to keep more of the money they earn. They want the security that goes with owning your home, saving for your retirement, living in a safe neighbourhood. They want the opportunity provided by a good education and a thriving economy.  And they expect fair play. I believe that to be treated equally is a birthright, and that discrimination is wrong. A Conservative Government will govern in the interests of everyone in our society - black or white, young or old, straight or gay, rural or urban, rich or poor.  People are tired of politicians who talk and talk, but fail to deliver. They're tired of politicians saying one thing before an election and doing something else afterwards. So the next Conservative Government will not only make a difference: it will be different. Accountability will be our watchword. This manifesto sets out clearly our priorities for what we will do, how we will pay for it, and the values by which we will govern.  People have had enough talk. It's time for action.    Value for Money and Lower Taxes  A strong economy is the foundation for everything we do. It provides higher living standards so that people can look to the future with optimism. It creates the jobs we all depend on - enabling families to build their financial independence. It should guarantee our pensions in old age. It provides a safety net for the least fortunate. It is essential in tackling poverty, including child poverty. It pays for our public services - our children's education and our parents' healthcare. And it allows us to invest in our nation's security - defence, the police and border controls.  Our economic success over generations has been built on the hard work, enterprise and creativity of the British people.  Today, government is spending too much, wasting too much and taxing too much. Britain cannot continue indefinitely to spend more than she is earning without higher taxes or higher interest rates - either of which will harm our economic prospects. If we are to secure our future prosperity, government must once again start to live within its means.  The consequences of Labour's profligacy are now plain to see. Last year, average living standards fell for the first time in over a decade - and the poorest 10 per cent of Britons became poorer.  We need to change direction.  The way in which a government allocates taxpayers' money demonstrates its values. By going to war on waste and ending ineffective  public spending programmes, we will achieve three simple aims.  First, we will give taxpayers value for money. We will spend the same as Labour would on the NHS, schools, transport and international development, and more than Labour on police, defence and pensions. But we will save £12 billion a year by 2007-8 by cutting back other expenditure. We will freeze civil service recruitment, remove 235,000 bureaucratic posts, and cut or abolish 168 public bodies.  Over the period to 2011-12, we will increase government spending by 4 per cent a year, compared to Labour's plans (on current trends) to increase spending by 5 per cent a year.  Second, we will avoid further Labour stealth taxes by reducing government borrowing. Of our £12 billion savings, we will use £8 billion to reduce Labour's excessive borrowing, so that we can avoid the tax rises that would otherwise be needed.  Third, we will lower taxes. We believe that people should choose how their money is spent. They should be rewarded for their hard work and be given peace of mind in old age. We will use the remaining £4 billion of our £12 billion savings to cut taxes in our first Budget.  Lower taxes promote enterprise and growth. But they also promote the right values. Hard-working families have suffered from Labour's tax raids on mortgages and marriage, pensions and petrol, buying a home and having a job.  "" People who work hard, pay their taxes and do the right  thing should be rewarded, not punished""      We will change direction. Whereas Labour want to make people more dependent on the State, we believe that lower taxes help families build their financial independence and security. For those on low incomes we will retain the minimum wage, together with proposed increases.  After a lifetime of paying taxes, we believe people deserve dignity in retirement. Rising council tax bills, which are up by 76 per cent since Labour came to power, have hit pensioners particularly hard. That is why our tax plans include halving council tax bills for millions of pensioners. Our new, permanent discount, reducing council tax bills by up to £500 for households where all residents are over 65 will be fully funded by central government.  A Conservative Government will increase the basic state pension in line with earnings rather than prices, reversing the spread of meanstesting. Over four years, this will increase the value of the pension by around £7 a week for single pensioners and £11 a week for couples - on top of increases in line with inflation. We will also keep all the other benefits that pensioners currently receive, including the Winter Fuel Payment, free television licences for the over-75s, and this year's one-off £200 council tax payment.  The financial security of pensioners tomorrow will be vastly improved by encouraging more saving today. To get more people into the saving habit, we will create a new Lifetime Savings Account in which government contributions top up the money that people save themselves. And we will take a series of steps to strengthen company pensions. We will abolish the rules that stop firms promoting pension  schemes to their staff, encouraging employers to make pension schemes 'opt-out' rather than 'opt-in'. We will also use the unclaimed assets of banks and other financial institutions to replenish the pension funds of people who lose out when a scheme fails.  The best guarantee of future prosperity is a dynamic economy. The growth of China, India and other Asian economies poses a direct challenge to our future competitiveness. New technology and the speed of global capital flows punish the inflexible and the sluggish. We need to reward risk-taking and innovation so that Britain becomes the best place in the world to start and grow a business.  As well as keeping taxes low, we must reduce the burdens on business through deregulation.  A Conservative Government will negotiate to restore our opt-out from the European Social Chapter and liberate small businesses from jobdestroying employment legislation.  Lower Taxes  · Value for money  · A lower tax economy  · Support for saving, dignity for pensioners  · Less regulation  · A stable economy with low interest rates      We will set regulatory budgets for each department, capping and then cutting the cost of the regulations that they can introduce in any one year. All new regulation will have to have benefits exceeding costs, and regulations will be given 'Sunset Reviews' to check that this remains the case. A Conservative Government will end the elaboration or 'goldplating' of EU directives.  A Conservative Government will lock in economic stability. We will maintain the independence of the Bank of England in setting interest rates. We will not join the Euro. By keeping the pound as our currency, control of our interest rates will continue to be set to meet the needs of the British economy. As the other major parties are committed to joining the euro, only the Conservatives can make this pledge.    Flexible Childcare and School Discipline  It's not easy bringing up a family in modern Britain. Parents who work hard to give their children the best start in life need a government that is on their side. That means access to flexible childcare and schools with good discipline and high standards.  Juggling work and family life can be a struggle. Under Labour, Britain has the most expensive childcare in Europe, and many working families receive no help.  Conservatives trust families to make the right decisions about childcare. We will reform the system to increase choice, flexibility and support for working families.  We will provide more flexible maternity pay - giving mothers a choice of whether to receive it over nine months, or a higher amount paid over six months.  During the next Parliament, we will ensure that all working families who qualify for the working tax credit will receive up to £50 a week for each child under the age of five, irrespective of the type of childcare they choose. We will end Labour's insistence on endless  form-filling and enable families to choose between formal and informal childcare.  We will also give extra support for workplace nurseries and provide a new network of clubs for older children.  Education enriches lives and provides us all, whatever our background, with the tools to achieve our ambitions.  Providing good education costs money - and our plans provide for an extra £15 billion a year for schools by 2009-10. Even more important than extra money, we must get the fundamentals right.  Classrooms need to be disciplined environments where children can learn. Teachers must be free to follow their vocation and inspire young minds. Standards must be maintained so that pupils, colleges and employers have examinations they can trust. Our education system should encourage excellence and ambition.  "" Teachers can only teach and children can only learn in  a school with good discipline""  Today, these basics have been completely neglected. Over one million children play truant each year. Head teachers have been denied the final say on expulsions, and good schools will be further punished by being forced to admit a quota of disruptive pupils.  Last year a third of children left primary school unable to write properly and more than 40,000 teenagers left school without a single GCSE. Examinations have been devalued so that it is possible to secure a 'C' Grade at GCSE maths with just 16 per cent.  A Conservative Government will put the right values at the heart of our education system. We will ensure proper discipline in schools by giving heads and governors full control over admissions and expulsions. We will not allow a minority to ruin the education of the majority. Instead of disrupting the education of others, difficult pupils will be given the chance to get their lives back on track in special Turnaround Schools.  The respect due to teachers will be enhanced by protecting them against malicious allegations of abuse and, most importantly, reducing the massive burden of paperwork.  Schools will be liberated to set their own priorities and budgets. The current proliferation of funding streams will be replaced by a simple system, with funds allocated on the basis of pupil numbers. Money will follow the pupil. Head teachers will then have the freedom to spend money in accordance with their school's own needs, without interference from Whitehall.  The examination system will be made more transparent and accountable. The targets which encourage examiners to award higher and higher grades for the same level of performance will be scrapped. Marks will be published alongside grades. And schools will be free to offer internationally-recognised qualifications alongside GCSEs and A-Level. We will slim down and improve the National Curriculum, root out political correctness, restore rigour and give teachers the scope once again to be creative and imaginative.    Many children leave school at 16 because they are bored and because vocational education does not have the status that it deserves. We will end the snobbery that has damaged vocational education. New grants will be made available to help pupils who wish to combine GCSEs with vocational study at a wide range of colleges, businesses and other enterprises. We will introduce 300,000 vocational grants of £1,000 each for 14-16 year olds.  Education should be about more than academic learning. Under Labour, sport has been squeezed out of the curriculum and child obesity has risen alarmingly.  Our schools should be places where children also learn other skills for life, such as healthy living, being part of a team and respecting others. We will give every child the right to two hours of after-school sport with our Club2School programme, at no cost to parents. We support improvements to school dinners, and will go further by banning junk food in schools.  Children need to be taught how to deal with risks in life. We will encourage learning outside the classroom and provide protection for teachers worried about school trips.  Parents know their children best and are increasingly frustrated at not being able to exercise more choice and control over their children's education. We will give parents the right to choose the school best suited to their child's needs, and our school expansion fund will provide an additional 600,000 places in our first term. This  will ensure that in our first five years 100,000 more parents get their first choice of school.  Schools will have responsibility for admissions, good schools will be allowed to grow and support will be given to new schools set up to respond to parental demand. Parents will also be able to send their children free of charge to any independent school that offers a place at no more than the cost of a state-funded school.  We will pay particular attention to children with special needs. Under Labour, the dogmatic pursuit of inclusion has led to the closure of special schools and children have suffered as a result. A Conservative Government will introduce a moratorium on the closure of special schools and give parents proper information and choice so they can secure the best opportunities for their children.  Labour have ignored the further education sector. We will simplify funding, replace the bureaucratic Learning and Skills Councils, ensure that money follows the student and allow colleges to apply for ""Super college"" status with greater freedom to manage budgets, specialise and innovate.  We will restore real choice in higher education by scrapping fees and abolishing Labour's admissions regulator. University funding will depend on attracting new students and so excellence will be encouraged. We will also help universities move towards greater financial independence by building up their individual endowments.  School Discipline  · Discipline in class  · Rigorous standards  · Choice for parents  · Investing more in local schools  · No university fees  Better Healthcare and Cleaner Hospitals  We believe that everyone has the right to high quality healthcare, free at the point of use, delivered when and where they need it.  Record amounts of taxpayers' money have been spent on the NHS. Yet over a million people are still waiting for treatment, and average waiting times have gone up. More people die each year from infections they pick up in hospitals than on Britain's roads.  Taxpayers have not received value for money because the NHS has not been reformed. It is too impersonal, too inflexible, too centralised and too bureaucratic to respond to the needs of patients.  Staff in the health service - from doctors and nurses to porters and cleaners - work hard to deliver world class healthcare. But the system lets them down.  We have a clear plan of action to cut waiting times and clean up hospitals. We will increase funding, reduce bureaucracy, empower local professionals to operate local services and give greater choice to patients.  We will increase the NHS budget by £34 billion a year during our first Parliament - at least as much as Labour - from £1,450 per head to £2,000 per head. And we will ensure that the money reaches the front line.  We will radically reduce the number of Primary Care Trusts, abolish the Strategic Health Authorities and cut the number of quangos, inspectorates and commissions.  Centrally set targets on hospitals will be abolished. Patients will be treated according to clinical needs, not government targets.  We should trust local professionals -  "" The NHS has been too centralised.  doctors and nurses ""  We will give power and responsibility to local professionals. All hospitals will have the freedom to hire staff, specialise and borrow to invest. In response to local demand, hospitals will have the flexibility to increase the number of individual rooms and invest in infection control teams. We will bring back matron, who will have the power to close wards for cleaning.  We will give patients and local GPs the right to choose the hospital or care provider that is right for them.  Funding will follow the patient and go directly to front-line care. Hospitals will be paid according to the treatments they deliver, rather than by Whitehall budgets. Small community hospitals which have the support of local patients and GPs will not be closed by bureaucrats.  Each year around 220,000 people without health insurance pay for important operations. We believe that providing a contribution based on the cost of half the NHS operation when people make these choices both recognises the tax they have paid towards the NHS and will help further reduce waiting lists.  Choice gives people power, a sense of purpose and control. It makes those who offer a service accountable to those who use it. It will give patients the clean hospitals and the shorter waiting times they want. Our policies will give everyone the kind of choice in healthcare that today only money can buy.  We believe that increased choice, combined with extra resources and freedom for local professionals, will end waiting lists as we know them during the life of the next Parliament.  As we live longer and expect more treatment and care to be available at home and in the community, social services will inevitably face greater demands. We will give people more control over their social care and introduce a partnership scheme so that no one is compelled to sell their home to pay for long-term care.  Carers who look after elderly or disabled relatives, including those suffering from long-term conditions, deserve more support. We will boost respite for carers and give them more choice and information about the support available.  We will ensure greater access to NHS dentistry by changing the way in which dentists are paid and offering patients a low monthly payment system to cover against large and unplanned bills.  We will introduce health checks for immigrants in order to curb the spread of diseases such as TB and to protect access to our NHS. It is, after all, a national health service not a world health service. People coming to Britain for over 12 months from outside the EU will be required to undergo a full medical test. And anyone settling permanently here from outside the EU will have to demonstrate that they have an acceptable standard of health and that they are unlikely to impose significant costs or demands on Britain's health system.  Public health is important - it affects every family in our country. That is why a Conservative Government will take action to tackle sexually transmitted infections (STIs). In Britain today we face an STI epidemic. Today's sexually transmitted infections are tomorrow's NHS bills. It's time for a clear, bold and very public health TV campaign - young people need to know the risks involved and the precautions they can take.  Cleaner hospitals  · More investment in local hospitals  · Shorter waiting times and cleaner wards  · Health professionals freed from Whitehall interference  · More choice for patients  · Support for family doctors  Safer Communities and More Police  Ensuring order is the first priority of government. Crime blights lives and ruins communities: it should not be excused, but condemned and punished. That means drawing a clear distinction between right and wrong, and restoring respect, discipline and decent values.  Crime today is out of control. There is a gun crime every hour. A million violent crimes are committed each year. Fewer than one in four crimes are now cleared up.  Criminals have a better chance of getting away with breaking the law today than at any time in the last 25 years.  Anti-social behaviour - vandalism, graffiti, binge-drinking, threatening behaviour - is a growing concern in all our communities.  Too many of Mr Blair's responses have been gimmicks, some of which, like marching yobs to cash machines, were never even introduced.  It doesn't have to be that way. Crime can be cut. Anti-social behaviour can be confronted. Communities can and should be made safe for the law-abiding. It requires active community policing and a relentless focus on catching, convicting and punishing criminals.  Labour's centralised control of the police has sapped officers' morale, increased bureaucracy and undermined public confidence.  It is time to change direction. We will recruit 5,000 new police officers each year, radically cut paperwork and introduce genuine local accountability, through elected police commissioners.  Giving local people a say over police priorities will lead to genuine neighbourhood policing with officers based in the locality clearly focused on zero tolerance.  When criminals are caught they should be punished properly. If appropriate they should be sent to prison, and in any event encouraged to reform their ways. None of these things happens properly today.  "" Our society needs more respect, discipline  and decent values. Crime is wrong and should be  punished, not excused""    So, we will end Labour's early release from prison scheme and provide 20,000 extra prison places.  o will introduce honesty in sentencing so that criminals serve the full sentence handed down by the court. They will be told, in open court, the minimum time that they will serve behind bars.  There is much that can be done to improve the justice system - the police, courts and the prison and probation services. But they only pick up the pieces of problems whose roots often lie elsewhere.  Our goal is to reverse the drift towards communities that are blighted by crime, where people live in fear. We will deliver safer neighbourhoods where the streets belong to the law-abiding.  will start at school by ensuring proper discipline.  will break the link between drugs and crime by massively expanding treatment programmes, including 25,000 residential rehab places (compared with fewer than 2,500 places today), and by giving all young users of hard drugs a straight choice - effective treatment or appearing in court. We will stop sending mixed messages on drugs by reversing Labour's reclassification of cannabis as a less serious drug, changing it from class 'C' back to class 'B'.  We will support the social institutions - families, schools, voluntary bodies and youth clubs - that can prevent crime and drug dependency before it starts.  A Conservative Government will place the highest possible priority on combating the threat from terrorism. This requires a coordinated response right across government, including funding for the intelligence services, training for the emergency services, robust anti-terror laws, controlled immigration and rigorous arrangements for the extradition and deportation of terrorist suspects. That's why we will appoint a Homeland Security Minister to co-ordinate our national response.  More Police  · 5,000 extra police a year  · Less paperwork and political correctness  · More rehab places for addicts  · Tougher sentences for career criminals  · Prisoners to serve their sentences in full  Secure Borders and Controlled Immigration  Britain has benefited from immigration. We all gain from the social diversity, economic vibrancy and cultural richness that immigration brings.  But if those benefits are to continue to flow we need to ensure that immigration is effectively managed, in the interests of all Britons, old and new.  This Government has lost effective control of our borders. More than 150,000 people (net) come to Britain every year, a population the size of Peterborough. Labour see ""no obvious upper limit to legal immigration"".  Our asylum system is in chaos. Instead of offering a safe haven to those most in need, the current system encourages illegality. Desperate individuals are forced into the hands of people smugglers and when they reach Britain they are open to continuing exploitation in the underground economy. Only two out of every ten asylum seekers are found to have a genuine claim.  Britain has reached a turning-point. That is why a Conservative Government will bring immigration back under control. We have set out a series of practical and considered steps to restore control and fairness to our immigration system.  First of all we will take proper control of our borders. We will ensure 24-hour surveillance at our ports, and restore full embarkation controls. Border security is currently divided between seven different bodies reporting to three different cabinet ministers. We believe that the time has now come to establish a British Border Control Police, whose sole job will be to secure Britain's borders.  We will introduce a points-based system for work permits similar to the one used in Australia. This will give priority to people with the skills Britain needs.  Controlled Immigration  · Australian-style points system for work permits  · Parliament to set annual immigration limit  · UK to take fair share of refugees  · 24-hour security at ports  · British Border Control Police  "" We welcome people who want to work hard and make a positive contribution ""  On asylum, a Conservative Government will not allow outdated and inflexible rules to prevent us shaping a system which is more humane, more likely to improve community relations and better managed. So we will take back powers from Brussels to ensure national control of asylum policy, withdraw from the 1951 Geneva Convention, and work for modernised international agreements on migration.  Our objective is a system where we take a fixed number of refugees from the UNHCR rather than simply accepting those who are smuggled to our shores. Asylum seekers' applications will be processed outside Britain.  We will set an overall annual limit on the numbers coming to Britain, including a fixed quota for the number of asylum seekers we accept. Parliament will set, and review, that number every year.  We are committed to making a continued success of Britain's diversity. There should be popular consent for further demographic change. And the best way to secure continuing support for future migration is by showing that government has control of our borders. Refusing to set a limit on new migrants is irresponsible politics. Only the Conservatives take this issue seriously enough to insist on a limit, and will introduce the policies necessary to police it.  Why can't  politicians  be more  accountable?  Accountability  In the real world, if you say you're going to do something, you do it. And if you fail, you can lose your job. That is accountability. Accountability is at the heart of good government and a healthy democracy. We all know that when people think they can get away with it, they won't do things as well as they should.  That's why we've published a Timetable for Action that sets out clearly what we will do, and when we will do it. And Michael Howard has made clear that ministers who fail to deliver will lose their jobs.  Under Mr Blair, the way we are governed has become less accountable, more complex and, ultimately, less democratic. Ministers don't take responsibility for their failures. Unprecedented powers have been given to new, unelected and remote bodies, including regional assemblies for which there is no popular support. The House of Commons has been steadily undermined, and proper reform of the House of Lords has been repeatedly promised but never delivered.  Conservatives understand that people identify with their town, city or county, not with arbitrary ""regions"". We will abolish Labour's regional assemblies. Powers currently exercised at a regional level covering planning, housing, transport and the fire service will all be returned to local authorities.  The House of Commons needs to be made more capable of standing up to the executive. We will strengthen select committees and make time for proper scrutiny of all legislation. As part of our drive for efficiency across Whitehall and Westminster, we will cut the number of MPs by 20 per cent. We will seek cross-party consensus for a substantially elected House of Lords.  Conservatives believe that the Union of England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland brings benefits to all parts of our United Kingdom.  We remain strongly committed to making a success of devolution in Scotland, so that it delivers for the Scottish people. In Wales we will work with the Assembly and give the Welsh people a referendum on whether to keep the Assembly in its current form, increase its powers or abolish it.  But devolution has brought problems of accountability at Westminster.  "" We believe in giving more power to individuals,  families and communities ""    Now that exclusively Scottish matters are decided by the Scottish Parliament in Edinburgh, exclusively English matters should be decided in Westminster without the votes of MPs sitting for Scottish constituencies who are not accountable to English voters. We will act to ensure that English laws are decided by English votes.  o are committed to supporting Northern Ireland's position within the United Kingdom in accordance with the consent principle. We will continue to work for a comprehensive political settlement, based on the principles of the Belfast Agreement. We will not accept any party into the government of Northern Ireland linked to a paramilitary organisation that holds on to illegal weapons and is engaged in any criminal activity. In the absence of devolved government, we will make direct rule more accountable.  Communities, Transport and the Environment  Britain draws great strength from its diversity. We are a country of vibrant urban centres, historic towns and an evolving countryside. It is both inefficient and insensitive to local communities to impose uniform control from Whitehall.  o believe in devolving power down to the lowest level so that local people are given greater control over their own lives.  Local councils should be accountable to voters. But under Labour, people's priorities have taken second place to centrally imposed targets and Whitehall inspection regimes. The cost to local taxpayers has increased rapidly, with council tax levels up 76 per cent since 1997. It has been a vicious circle - less representation and more taxation.  The Conservatives will liberate local government.  Local communities will have a greater say over planning decisions.  o will also give new powers to help local councils to deal with those incidents, such as illegal traveller encampments, which breach planning laws. Together with clear guidance for police and our review of the Human Rights Act, this will ensure fairness for all, rather than special rules for different groups.  With greater power for local people will come less interference from central government. We will radically cut the burdens on local councils.  A Conservative Government will support creativity and excellence in the arts. Instead of Labour's centralised bureaucracy and political interference, including in the National Lottery, we will devolve funding and decision-making while ensuring that the lottery supports the arts, heritage, sport and charities.  The most powerful form of devolution is to individuals and families. The Right to Buy for council tenants extended home ownership, transformed many of Britain's housing estates and expanded our property-owning democracy.  A Conservative Government will extend this right to tenants of housing associations. Our plans to boost shared ownership schemes, and give social housing tenants the right to own a share of their home, will also benefit first-time buyers.  Empowering individuals also means giving them the opportunity to get around Britain more quickly and safely. A modern economy depends on it.  A Conservative Government will end Labour's war on the motorist. We will modernise Britain's road network and review all speed cameras to ensure they are there to save lives, not make money.  We will bring stability to the rail network, avoiding further costly and inefficient re-organisation. Successful train operating companies will have their franchises extended to allow companies to invest in improved stations, car parks, facilities and rolling stock.  A commitment to safeguarding our environment lies deep in Conservative thinking. We instinctively understand the importance of conservation, natural beauty and our duty of stewardship of the earth.  A Conservative Government will call a halt to Labour's plans to concrete over our green fields. We will promote development on  brownfield sites and establish more Green Belts with tighter development rules.  To ensure Britain plays its part in combating climate change, we will phase out the use of harmful HFCs and deliver greater incentives to make homes more energy-efficient. Through cuts in Vehicle Excise Duty and increased grants, we will significantly reduce the cost of cars with low carbon emissions. We believe that households and businesses should recycle an increasing amount of their waste.  A Conservative Government will guarantee the security and sustainability of Britain's energy supplies. We will do this by supporting the development of a broad range of renewable energy sources. We also recognise that energy efficiency must play an increasingly important role in our energy policy.  Conservatives understand the pressures on the livelihoods of those who work in rural areas.  We value the diverse nature of our nation and believe in defending traditional liberties. A Conservative Government will therefore introduce a Bill, and offer Parliament a free vote, to overturn the Government's ban on hunting with dogs.  Britain's farmers operate to some of the highest animal welfare standards in the world and help to preserve the countryside for all of us to enjoy. We will introduce a Bill to ensure honest labelling of food and stem the flow of expensive new regulation. We will support initiatives, such as farmers' markets and local food projects, that enable British customers to support Britain's farmers. The Little Red Tractor mark denotes high British animal welfare and production standards. We will insist that all publicly procured food carries this mark.  We will press for further reform of the Common Agricultural Policy, to make it less burdensome for farmers and taxpayers alike. And we will promote legislation to strengthen and update animal welfare.  Housing and Planning  · The Right to Buy for housing association tenants  · Protecting the Green Belt  · Action against illegal traveller camps  Transport  · A modern road network  · Review of all speed cameras  · Longer rail franchises  Environment  · Harmful HFCs phased out  · Lower VED for environmentally friendly cars  · Clear labelling for British food  Accountability  · English votes for English laws  · Abolition of regional assemblies  · A stronger Parliament  Defending our Freedoms  Britain plays a unique role in the world. We are the only nation that is one of the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council, a net contributor to the European Union, a member of the G8, at the centre of the Commonwealth family of nations and a leading member of NATO. We are a global trading nation with interests in every continent. As the world's fourth largest economy, we have the potential to be a powerful force for good.  These durable strengths allow Britain to defend our interests and promote our values across the globe.  As a country, we have been in the vanguard of freedom's advance, a friend to the growth of democracy, an advocate of the rule of law, a defender of the oppressed and a robust protector of our people's security.  But, under this Government, Britain's ability to defend its interests and secure valuable freedoms has been undermined. Our Armed Forces, the vital muscle which allows us to punch above our  weight, have been allowed to weaken. And our relations with the European Union have been mismanaged in a way which threatens not just British interests, but the capacity of the continent to adapt flexibly to the future.  A Conservative Government will strengthen our Armed Forces within NATO by spending £2.7 billion more than Labour on the front line by 2007-08.  Those serving in our Armed Forces are vitally important to us, so we must take care of the people most important to them. A Conservative Government will support service families. They deserve decent homes, good schools for their children, and the chance to spend as much time as possible with their families.  We will make the Army stronger. A Conservative Government will preserve the regiments Labour would abolish and improve the supply and procurement of weaponry.  "" We should support our Armed Forces and our foreign  policy should serve the British national interest ""  We will save warships Mr Blair would scrap. A Conservative Government will support European co-operation on defence but we strongly believe that such co-operation should take place within the framework of NATO.  its provisions in a referendum within six months of the General Election. We also oppose giving up the valuable freedom which control of our own currency gives us. We will not join the Euro.  If a Conservative Government ever has to take the country to war, we will tell the British people why. Mr Blair misrepresented intelligence to make the case for war in Iraq, and failed to plan for the aftermath of Saddam Hussein's downfall. It is nevertheless the case that a democratic Iraq would be a powerful beacon of hope in a troubled part of the world. So we believe that Britain must remain committed to rebuilding Iraq and allowing democracy to take hold. And a Conservative Government will work to achieve peace in the Middle East based on the principle of Israel secure within its borders and a viable Palestinian state.  Conservatives support the cause of reform in Europe and we will co-operate with all those who wish to see the EU evolve in a more flexible, liberal and decentralised direction. We oppose the EU Constitution and would give the British people the chance to reject  In a reformed Europe, the restrictive employment laws of the Social Chapter will have to give way to more flexible working. We will ensure that Britain once again leads the fight for a deregulated Europe by negotiating the restoration of our opt-out from the Social Chapter.  The common policies on agriculture and fisheries are unsustainable, damaging to free trade and conservation, and waste huge sums of money. The CAP needs further and deeper reform. And, because fisheries would be better administered at the national level, we will negotiate to restore national and local control over British fishing grounds. We are determined to ensure national control in this area.  We will also build on the success of enlargement, making Europe more diverse by working to bring in more nations, including Turkey.  We value Britain's membership of the European Union, but our horizons extend much further. A key element of British foreign policy under a Conservative Government will be fighting world poverty. We will support further action on debt relief and will work to meet the UN target of spending 0.7 per cent of national income on overseas aid by 2013. We believe that British aid programmes are among the best in the world, so we will negotiate to increase British national control over our international aid spending.  Above all, we recognise that there is a vital thread that links open markets, free trade, property rights, the rule of law, democracy, economic development and social progress. We will use our global influence to champion these principles in the interests of the developing world.  Britain and the World  · No to the Euro and EU Constitution  · More and better aid to tackle global poverty  · Stronger Armed Forces  · Keeping NATO at the heart of our foreign policy  The Choice at this Election The choice before voters is very clear.  They can either reward Mr Blair for eight years of broken promises and vote for another five years of talk.  Or they can vote Conservative, to support a party that has taken a stand and is committed to action on the issues that matter to hardworking Britons.
